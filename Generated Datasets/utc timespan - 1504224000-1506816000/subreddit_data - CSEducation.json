Right now I have the kids writing code in notepad/idle so they can get a grasp of the basics. I'd like to move to something like codeboard, where there's an IDE built into a webpage (so they can use it at home or in another classroom and have a familiar interface and all of their files in one place). I'd prefer if they could use google signin but that's not supported here. I don't really want to have to deal with them all creating accounts and losing passwords and everything, but I was also just curious if there were any good alternatives. I've set up a little server in the room too, so I'm not against installing a software solution there, but I'm mainly just curious what you all use for this. Thanks.",

The school seems to be giving me some leeway in how I get there, as long as I complete the state curriculum.\n\nI will be teaching about 20 first year students along side 5-10 second year students in two different classes during the same time period. Here's the plan.\n\n**First Years (C#, Web, Multimedia):**\n\nWk 1 - Introductions, Housekeeping\n\nWk 2 - Intro to computers and programming\n\nWk 3 - Introduction to C#\n\nWk 4 - Processing Data\n\nWk 5 - Making Decisions\n\nWk 6 - Loops, Files, and Random Numbers\n\nWk 7 - Modularizing Code with Methods\n\nWk 8 - Arrays and Lists\n\nWk 9 - More about Processing Data\n\nWk 10 - Classes and Multiform Projects\n\nWk 11 (Thanksgiving) - Catch up days\n\nWk 12 - Databases\n\nWk 13 - Catch up days\n\nWk 14 - Final C# Project\n\nWk 15 - (Christmas)\n\nWk 16 - (Christmas)\n\nWk 17 - HTML Basics\n\nWk 18 - Combining HTML with CSS\n\nWk 19 - Responsive Design\n\nWk 20 - Client Side Javascript\n\nWk 21 - Client Side Javascript\n\nWk 22 - Server Side Javascript\n\nWk 23 - Server Side Javascript\n\nWk 24 - Content Management Systems\n\nWk 25 - PHP/SQL\n\nWk 26 - PHP/SQL\n\nWk 27 - Catch Up Week\n\nWk 28 - Final Web Project\n\nWk 29 - (Spring Break)\n\nWk 30 - Intro to Videography & Cameras\n\nWk 31 - Principals of Film\n\nWk 32 - Writing for Video\n\nWk 33 - Lighting/Sound\n\nWk 34 - Filming\n\nWk 35 - Editing/Effects\n\nWk 36 - Editing/Effects\n\nWk 37 - Final Multimedia project\n\nWk 38 - (End of School) Catch Up and Finals\n\n\n\n**Second Years (JAVA, C++, Multimedia)**\n\nWk 1 - Introductions, Housekeeping\n\nWk 2 - Review Intro to computers and programming, test in C# and Web work to make sure they're ready for year 2.\n\nWk 3 - Java Fundamentals\n\nWk 4 - Making Decisions\n\nWk 5 - Loops, Files and Random Numbers\n\nWk 6 - Methods\n\nWk 7 - Classes Pt. 1\n\nWk 8 - Arrays\n\nWk 9 - Classes & Objects\n\nWk 10 - Text Processing and Wrapper Classes\n\nWk 11 - (Thanksgiving) Catch up days\n\nWk 12 - Inheritance\n\nWk 13 -  Exceptions and File I/O\n\nWk 14 - GUI Applications\n\nWk 15 - (Christmas)\n\nWk 16 - (Christmas)\n\nWk 17 - GUI Applications\n\nWk 18 - Final Java Projet\n\nWk 19 - Introduction to C++\n\nWk 20 - Expressions & Interactivity\n\nWk 21 - Decision Making, Loops & Functions\n\nWk 22 - Classes & Objects\n\nWk 23 - Arrays, Searching & Sorting\n\nWk 24 - Algorithm Analysis\n\nWk 25 - Pointers\n\nWk 26 - Advanced Classes and OOP\n\nWk 27 - C-Strings, Files & I/O Operations\n\nWk 28 - Final C++ Project\n\nWk 29 - (Spring Break)\n\nWk 30 - Intro to Videography & Cameras\n\nWk 31 - Principals of Film\n\nWk 32 - Writing for Video\n\nWk 33 - Lighting/Sound\n\nWk 34 - Filming\n\nWk 35 - Editing/Effects\n\nWk 36 - Editing/Effects\n\nWk 37 - Final Multimedia Project\n\nWk 38 - (End of School) Catch up and Finals\n\nI realize that trying to plan this far out is difficult, but I feel that if I have a target, I'm a lot more likely to hit the target. Students who excel will be allowed to work ahead if they are capable and I can always add additional lessons to the curriculum, too. Any suggestions are more than welcome. Thank you.",

Right now I have the kids writing code in notepad/idle so they can get a grasp of the basics. I'd like to move to something like codeboard, where there's an IDE built into a webpage (so they can use it at home or in another classroom and have a familiar interface and all of their files in one place). I'd prefer if they could use google signin but that's not supported here. I don't really want to have to deal with them all creating accounts and losing passwords and everything, but I was also just curious if there were any good alternatives. I've set up a little server in the room too, so I'm not against installing a software solution there, but I'm mainly just curious what you all use for this. Thanks.",
