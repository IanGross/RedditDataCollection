Formal verification has been around decades longer than PCC and yet I usually don't see the two lumped together.  I'm assuming that PCC falls under the umbrella of formal verification just as proof-carrying hardware does also, but I'm not particularly sure.

            "selftext": "I am aware of Turing's proof of the undecidability of the halting problem (and I think I understand it). What I'm asking is quite different. I shall define what I mean by \"effectively solvable\":    \n         \n> A problem $P$ is **effectively solvable** if there exists an agent $A_P$, such that for any specific instance of $P \\, (P_i)$, $A$ can solve that instance of the problem $(P_i)$ in a finite time.       \n          \n&nbsp;       \nImagine $A_P$ as a [superintelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence) with unbounded (but finite) computational power, and unbounded (but finite) memory. $P$ is effectively solvable if $A_P$ would eventually (in finite time) produce a correct solution for any given instance of $P$.     \n&nbsp;             \nIt may be the case that there does not exist any algorithm that \"solves\" diophantine problems, however this does not mean the problem is not effectively solvable. For any given diophantine problem, a sufficiently intelligent agent (or sufficiently competent mathematician) may be able to eventually find its roots using an (**unbounded**) number of mathematical tricks. The mathematical methods applied to diophantine problems is limited only by the creativity of the agent concerned. There are essentially an infinite number of strategies, from which a finite subset may be drawn from in sequence (forming an algorithm) to apply to a particular diophantine problem.     \n&nbsp;                    \nEffective solvability (or effective decidability) is different from the traditional notion of decidability in that problem that are effectively solvable do not require a finite number of steps which always guarantee a solution. In fact, for each instance of an effectively solvable problem, a different algorithm may be used. There may be no general algorithm that solves all instances of a problem, but for each instance of the problem, a tailor made algorithm may exist.      \n&nbsp;                    \nGoing entirely off my intuition here, I think the following is a definition of \"effectively solvable\":      \n         \n> > A problem $P$ is effectively solvable for A if  $\\not\\exists$ an instance $P_i$ of $P |$ A does not solve $P_i$ in finite sequence of steps.       \n         \n&nbsp;                    \nIf there is a tailor made algorithm for every instance of a problem, then a sufficiently intelligent agent can in practice solve every instance of the problem. Thus even if in theory no general solution to the problem exists, in practice, specific solutions to the problem always exist.      \n&nbsp;             \nWhile some of such problems may be \"undecidable\", they are in actuality (for all practical purposes) \"effectively solvable\".      \n&nbsp;             \nThe set of effectively solvable problems is a superset (and I assert that it is a proper superset) of the set of decidable problems.     \n&nbsp;                    \n&nbsp;                     \nAs for my question, I think the halting problem is effectively solvable, but I'm not sure. I suspect this is not what I really want to ask though (I am interested in the answer to the question). What I am truly interested in is effective solvability. Does a concept of effective solvability already exist? Please point me in the right direction to do further study on effective solvability.     \n&nbsp;                        \nI am interested in effective solvability, because the range of problems that can be solved by an AI is not (necessarily) the range of problems that can be solved by a Turing machine, but the range of problems that are effectively solvable. I feel that the traditional notion of decidability is outdated when the computer is a sufficiently intelligent agent (one may make the argument that machine learning already renders traditional decidability obsolete as far as this problem is concerned. Thus when we ask the question:    \n\"What problems can a computer solve?\"      \nI feel the set of effectively solvable problems and not (necessarily) the set of decidable problems is the answer.    \n&nbsp;         \n> What are some problems that are not effectively solvable by your definition?     \n       \nI do not know of any, and I suspected there may be none. To hazard a guess however: \n       \n1. Problems which may involve randomness may not be effectively solvable. In particular if the computer gets the right answer, but doesn't know it got the right answer, then it can never solve that instance of the problem. Such problems are thus not effectively solvable.       \n2. Any problem for which there exists a single instance of the problem for which there does not exist in algorithm that always produces the correct answer for that instance of the problem are not effectively solvable.       \n         \nI may add examples of those two types of problems later, but I cannot think of any succinct examples right now.     \n&nbsp;       \nLet the sufficiently intelligent agent be Omega. For the problem that Omega is tasked to solve, Omega can solve instances of that problem even if Omega does not have a general algorithm for all instances of the problem. Omega can craft a tailor-made solution (algorithm) to any specific instance of a problem. Let all tailor-made algorithms (TMAs) Omega uses on instances of any problem use steps that come from a (countably) infinite set $S$. Consider the set of all finite sequences of steps from $S$, let's call this $T$. $T$ is the set of all possible TMAs that Omega can use on any instance of $S$. $T$ can be thought of as the \"toolkit\" of Omega. The Omega encounters a particular instance of a particular problem (for which Omega has no general algorithm to solve), Omega crafts a TMA to solve that particular instance. This crafting can be thought of as Omega selecting a TMA from $T$.       \n      \n$T$ is countably infinite. Thus Omega's actual operation is selecting an algorithm from an infinite set of algorithms whenever faced with a particular instance of a problem. However, Omega has only finite memory. Thus, Omega never actually stores $T$ in memory. What happens is that whenever Omega faces a certain $P_i$, Omega tries an algorithm to solve that $P_i$. This algorithm may be generated on the spot. However, if Omega faced an infinite number of $P_i$s for some $P$, then it could be seen how Omega employs an infinite number of TMAs to solve each instance of $P$.        \n       \nWhen we say Omega can effectively solve $P$, we're saying that if Omega was fed sequences of some $P_i$ endlessly, that there would never come a time, in which Omega would fail some $P_i$. It is this sense in which we consider Omega hypothetically attempting all $P_i$, in which it becomes useful to think of Omega has having an infinite set of algorithms from which it can draw from.         \n&nbsp;            \nOmega is not a hyper computer or Turing oracle, and may be safely thought of as a Turing machine (or equivalent model of computation). Omega is only faced with specific instances of a problem, and does not need to have a general solution of the problem to be considered as effectively solving it.      \n&nbsp;            \nAssume Omega can effectively solve $P$, but does not know a general algorithm to solve $P$. If for each $P_i$, Omega adopts $t_i$, then you could construct a method for solving $P$ as follows:      \n> If $P_i$, then do $t_i$.       \n&nbsp;            \nHowever, if the sets of all instances of $P$ is an infinite set, then the above method would also contain an infinite number of steps. Does, the above method is **not** an algorithm.         \n&nbsp;              \nYet, it may be the case that Omega does not have a general algorithm for solving $P$, but there does not exist some $P_i$, which Omega would not solve in finite team.       \n&nbsp;     \nEffective solvability can be seen as asking if there is an infinite sequence of steps that solve the problem in the general case. Thus, if a problem is effectively solvable, there may be no algorithm that solves that problem (as such an algorithm would need an infinite number of steps). It is because effective solvability permits methods which contain an infinite number of steps, that I assert that the space of effectively solvable problems is a superset of the space of Turing decidable problems. It is why I draw the distinction between effective solvability and Turing decidability.                \n&nbsp;            \nThe way I think of Omega employs the concept of [Vingean uncertainty](http://intelligence.org/files/ai-alignment-problem-handoutLQ.pdf). The more intelligent Omega is, the more confident I am that Omega would reliably achieve its goals (in this case solve specific instances of specific problems) and the less knowledge I possess of the particular steps Omega would take in achieving it's goals.         \n&nbsp;              \nOmega is of arbitrarily high intelligence. If I am to ask the question of \"What problems can Omega solve?\", then the space of all effectively solvable problems seems like the correct answer to me (I am very convinced that the space of Turing decidable problems may be a wrong answer).

One of the definitions has the following wording:\n\n\"Write a function, named xyz, that takes a single number as an argument and that returns True when the argument is positive and False otherwise.\"\n\nNow I've done a little bit of programming before, enough to know that this kind of instruction would best be solved using a conditional ('if') statement. However, his instructions clearly say\n\n\"You must write this function using a relational operator and without using any sort of conditional (i.e., if); the solution without a conditional is actually much simpler than one with.\"\n\nNow I don't know if that last part is true since nobody in the class can figure it out, but that's beside the point.

I don't really understand where the 2^(\u03a3*) comes from, and how I would \"apply the right hand side\". The article listed as a source of this definition is behind a paywall unfortunately. The least solution is then defined as \u2210*_(k\u22650)\u03c6^(k)(\u22a5)_* where \u22a5 = (\u2205, ..., \u2205) (vector containing only empty languages.

            "selftext": "THIS IS FOR A PROBLEM IN A TEXTBOOK ABOUT USING NEURAL NETS TO RECOGNIZE HANDWRITTEN DIGITS. (link at bottom, read directions if you would like to read directly in addition to my post)\nSHORT VERSION: IN SIGMOID NEURON NEURAL NETWORK(FEEDFOWARD)(3 layers), How can you use 4 output neurons instead of 10 for a program that expresses whether a handwritten digit is numbered 0-9 where the 10 neurons each represent 1,2 ,3 etc. how can you do that but with 4 neurons? (author provided math logic 42 = 16 ) what does that mean in this context?\nWhat is binary representation ? how do i find it or show it in a N.N. How do i find the proper weights and biases in the exercise detailed below?\nLONG VERSION:This is a 3 layer Feed Forward Neural Network made of Sigmoid Neurons. The author is is describing how to build a N.N. to classify handwritten digits. The Input Neuron Layer has 778=24x24 neurons to represent the intensities of the image pixels. The second or \"hidden\" layer has a varied number of neurons. \"The output layer of the network contains 10 neurons. If the first neuron fires, i.e., has an output \u22481, then that will indicate that the network thinks the digit is a 0. If the second neuron fires then that will indicate that the network thinks the digit is a 1. And so on. A little more precisely, we number the output neurons from 0 through 9, and figure out which neuron has the highest activation value. If that neuron is, say, neuron number 6, then our network will guess that the input digit was a 6. And so on..\" I understand this all, But then, he says \"A seemingly natural way of doing that is to use just 4 output neurons, treating each neuron as taking on a binary value, depending on whether the neuron's output is closer to 0 or to 1. Four neurons are enough to encode the answer, since 42= 16 is more than the 10 possible values for the input digit. \" i do not understand at all how you could 4 outputs to express 10 different possibilities. Please help me understand this.\nAnd later, he has us do a exercise \"There is a way of determining the bitwise representation of a digit by adding an extra layer to the three-layer network above. The extra layer converts the output from the previous layer into a binary representation,(Illustrates a figure where the new outputs are 4 in total(Don't know if that is specific to the 4 outputs described earlier or just a random representation). . Find a set of weights and biases for the new output layer. Assume that the first 3 layers of neurons are such that the correct output in the third layer (i.e., the old output layer) has activation at least 0.99, and incorrect outputs have activation less than 0.01\" How do i find weights and biases in this specific problem( i know how to calculate them kinda like using sigmoid function i can do that, but just not completely sure how to use it through whole N.N.) http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html To read the problem in greater length and context, open the provided link and scroll to \"A simple network to classify handwritten digits\".\nTHANK YOU<3",

I've been attempting it for two weeks and have it mostly working except for one key part. Any advice would be very helpful. Also, If there is a better sub for this, please lmk.\n\nThe assignment is to implement merge sort on intervals. In our merge procedure however, we are also supposed to combine intervals that 'touch' or 'overlap'\n\nAn example input:\n\n     3\n     -1 40 1 30\n     2 3 -5 2\n     3 4 7 1\n\nThe format is the first line is # of intervals, each line after is :\n\nleft numerator, left denominator, right numer, right denom\n\nA negative numerator means the interval is \"closed\" at that point. \n\nSo for example, the interval (2/3, 5/2] overlaps with the interval (3/4, 7/1) so they would be combined as (2/3, 7/1).\n\nI have my merge sort working currently just sorting by x values of the intervals. I understand the math of how to check if intervals are overlapping and combine them (we aren't allowed to use division, and, therefore, no floating-point). \n\nWhat I cannot understand is how to do this through the recursive calls of merge sort. How do I keep track of what indices in my array of structures have already been merged and should not be looked at? I've thought about shifting elements of the array, but this is quadratic and not nlogn as my code needs to be. I've thought about incorporating return values into the merge and mergesort routines, but that didn't seem to go anywhere.\n\nI just really need a push in the right direction, as I feel like I've been overthinking it... Office hours have been no help, and after two weeks, I think I need different minds to help.\n\nThanks in advance.\n",

I have started with having different classes for each database I need access to using static methods to perform the various queries. There will eventually be many queries (20ish) per database access object. They either query and return a populated data object or update the database, there is never need to carry data between methods.\n\nNow my question stems from a concern from a few co-workers. They insist that they do not like this single class operation, and I cannot understand it for the life of me. This class allows for me to keep all database access in one place and just pass in parameters. I can create methods that describe the operation and the class name itself describes the database which is being operated upon.\n\nUsing this allows me to not worry about having random query strings, try/catches, and data sources scattered throughout the logic classes throughout the application. \n\nWith that being said as the amount of queries grow I will seperate certain things into other classes, for example I had an idea of doing something like.\n\n    SpecificDB.Insert.Operation(params);\n    List<DBInfo> info = SpecificDB.Retrieve.Operation(params);\nSo yes the Insert and Retrieve would reference separate objects but isn't necessary to do like this as its just an idea I had. To me this just seems cleaner, organized, and more maintainable than just setting up the connection and query for every class than needs to execute some query. I guess I just do not understand my co-workers concerns, and they have not given me a good reason to change how I feel about it.\n",

So they have different time constraints based on language listed on their [website](https://www.hackerrank.com/environment) and reading though that seemed pretty interesting.\n\nc/c++ was champion with 2 seconds, obviously. Java, However was given 4 seconds. With JIT and all I thought Java was believed to be c++ 's equal. Of course, the kinds of program written for HR isn't representative of programs generally written. But still, wasn't it a bit too high?\n\nPython was 10, seemed ok to me. My biggest surprise was however pypy, with 3 secs it was the runner-up, even before Java. I have been programming in Python for 3 yrs, never gave it much thought before, until now.\n\nHaskell was 5 secs, and judging by the opinions of Haskell community, this too seems to be an underestimate. However, I personally think Haskell's standard library's data structures have comparatively bad complexity. Don't know for sure, still a noob in that.\n\nRust was 5 secs. Wasn't the whole point of Rust's existence the fact that it's as fast as C despite being blah blah...That seemed like a pretty bold ambition. How close is Rust to that end? has HR got it completely wrong?\n\nI would love to hear thoughts of people regularly using these languages on their position in the list. \n\nEDIT : It is NOT a benchmark. It is hackerrank's attempt to answer, \"If a code takes 2 secs to run in c++, how long is it going to take in python? or Java? or....\".
