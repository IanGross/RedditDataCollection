Ledger is an accounting tool, and calorific is a calorie tracking tool. What they both have in common are these ideas:\n\n1. They're simple CLI tools.\n2. They take normal human-readable text files as input.\n3. They don't edit the input files - that's your job.\n\nI love this idea so much. It's what I've always wanted. I prefer to manage my own text files (and already do for lots of things like to-do lists and such). I don't want some huge, complicated program taking over everything, making me have to adapt to Their Way, and having no idea how or where it stores its data. That puts me at the mercy of that program, creating a dependency on it, locking me in and trapping me. I like the freedom and control offered by ledger and calorific.\n\nAre there any other interesting tools you know of that work this same way? They could be for anything useful, as long as they meet the three points listed above.\n\nThanks.",

(oh and i'm aware there is no point in linking the cache directory; it'd rather link it as an emptry dir, though, so when setting up a fresh system, that directory will be right there; i'd ignore all files in that directory when syncing).\n\nis it somehow possible to either just **copy** the entire folder structure? something like `imaginative_command <source> <destiny>` which will create all those folders and subdirectories for me? or, even better, a way to link directores and it's subdirectories -including all files- instead of each file individually?\n\nthis idea just came to me while typing: i could `git init` each folder i need, commit it to my local git server, then `git submodule add` all those repos to me main dotfiles repo. this way, i will have those files back when restoring; **however**, deploying all those files will be a bitch again, or, even worse, cause some problem i cannot even foresee at the moment.\n\nall input is greatly appreciated :) thanks in advance for your help.",

I'm teaching my girlfriend to use Linux properly, and her knowledge is limited to cd, ls, gcc and some git (but very superficially). She knows pretty much nothing about pipes, jobs, variables, coreutils (not even grep), vim, nano, etc. Learned it in university, forgot about it immediately.\n\nIt would benefit her (web dev) work greatly if she knew how to use bash/zsh interactively AND write scripts. She prefers video tutorials to get her started and is easily discouraged by 'hard' stuff. But if it's explained condescendingly, she gets pissed, so none of that. No \"read the fucking man(ual| page)\" for her, either.\n\nAny suggestions? I'm teaching her bit by bit, but she gets easily discouraged when she sees me do something 'complex' (everyday stuff like moving, searching, deleting files, filtering with grep).",

I wanted a really simple but powerful program\nwhere I understand exactly everything that is going on and where, if this\nprogram at some point of its development stops being maintained, I can easily\nreuse the \"database\" model. I wanted to be able to script in 4 lines of code\nsomething that I have to change in all my papers. I wanted a fully open source\nalternative where I just type a command in the terminal and I get the pdf\nand the bibtex information, in 4 seconds, all being done in simple modular\ncode that I can understand. I wanted to be able to define different\nlibraries in a text file so that I can share with other people without\nforcing them to open an account somewhere. I wanted to be able to put\nmy papers and books in a repository so that I can have the same papers in\nmy laptops and workplace, using tools I'm confortable with.\n\nLong story short, I wanted to present here a git-inspired, command line based\nbibliography manager\n\n  https://github.com/alejandrogallo/papis",

You can insert `noglob` before the command and that'll work but most of time, I am that lazy to do that. I created a Zsh widget and bound to the CTRL-X Enter key. So, if I want to escape it, I'll press CTRL-X and then Enter, noglob will be inserted and the command will run.\n\n    # Define the widget\n    function run_command_with_noglob() {\n    \tBUFFER=\"noglob $BUFFER\"\n    \tzle accept-line\n    }\n    \n    # Load the widget\n    zle -N run_command_with_noglob\n    \n    # Bind the widget\n    bindkey '^X^M' run_command_with_noglob # Run commands as is with CTRL-X Enter.\n\nIs it cool?

            "selftext": "Hi Everyone. I was wondering if someone can tell me if there is a way to allow few ip addresses to be connected to a ncat ip addresses. Why do I ask? I am trying to make a ncat connection between my kali linux and my windows vm.  I am using vmware and vmware is using vmnet8=172.16.187.1, the gateway is 172.16.187.2 and my kali linux ip address is 192.168.1.5. I am using the following command to connect to the windows vm:\n\n    ncat -v 172.16.187.128 4444 --ssl\n\nand I am using this command to pass my shell upon the connection on the windows side:\n\n    ncat --exec cmd.exe --allow  192.168.1.5 , 172.16.187.1 -vnl 4444 --ssl\n\nobviously this command does not work. However, if I just mention one IP address-172.16.187.1, I am able to get a shell without using a ssl connection but when I want to use a ssl connection, it end up giving me an error which I believe is because the main ip address is not allowed in the command. So, my question is how can I allow the network to receive traffic from both address?\n\nThanks!\n\n",

            "selftext": "Hi again. I really appreciate all of you guys. So, now working on making a python ping sweep for my subnet and you might be thinking this is a command line subreddit, why are you here? well, I was wondering if there is a way to make the result of the ping or ping sweep not visible in the command line. To give you a better understanding here is my code:\n\n#! /usr/bin/python\n\n    import subprocess\n    import os\n    import multiprocessing\n\n\n    nrange = \"192.168.1.\"\n\n    for i in range(1, 254):\n        address = nrange + str(i)\n        res = subprocess.call(['ping', '-c', '3', '-w',     '3',  address])\n        if res == 0:\n            print address \n        else:\n            pass\n\nand here are my results:\n\n    PING 192.168.1.1 (192.168.1.1) 56(84) bytes of data.\n    64 bytes from 192.168.1.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=1.36 ms\n    64 bytes from 192.168.1.1: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=1.93 ms\n    64 bytes from 192.168.1.1: icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=1.17 ms\n\n    --- 192.168.1.1 ping statistics ---\n    3 packets transmitted, 3 received, 0% packet loss, time 2002ms\n    rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 1.173/1.491/1.934/0.324 ms\n    192.168.1.1\n    PING 192.168.1.2 (192.168.1.2) 56(84) bytes of data.\n    64 bytes from 192.168.1.2: icmp_seq=1 ttl=128 time=0.956 ms\n    64 bytes from 192.168.1.2: icmp_seq=2 ttl=128 time=1.27 ms\n    64 bytes from 192.168.1.2: icmp_seq=3 ttl=128 time=1.61 ms\n\n    --- 192.168.1.2 ping statistics ---\n    3 packets transmitted, 3 received, 0% packet loss, time 2002ms\n    rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.956/1.283/1.618/0.273 ms\n    192.168.1.2\n    PING 192.168.1.3 (192.168.1.3) 56(84) bytes of data.\n\nSO, in this example it would only print out 192.168.1.1 and 192.168.1.2 and nothing else would show up in the command line.\n\nThank you!",
