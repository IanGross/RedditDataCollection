During the \u201cNo Service\u201d period, data doesn\u2019t work and I can\u2019t call again.\n\nHopefully it will be fixed in iOS 11.1. This current version of iOS is being terribly buggy and slow and awkward to use for me.\n\nI wish I could go back to iOS 10.3.3 because that was rock solid but I can\u2019t because I have updated my Apple Watch to watchOS 4 and you need watchOS 3.2.3 or earlier to be able to pair with iOS 10. :(",

            "selftext": "I'm thinking of selling my Mac and going iOS only (basically don't need a Mac anymore). I have found solutions to many workflows, but not for data backup.\n\nRegardless of which file provider I use (iCloud, Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive), their iOS app don't download everything to the device. And even if they had that possibility, that may not be possible depending on the size of your device (at least the iPhone 8 and iPad Pro comes with 64GB!).\n\nThat means that your files probably just exist in the cloud (and some of them on your device). Not acceptable for me, I want at least 2 separate locations. \n\n- I found https://mover.io and if I understand correctly it can make a backup of your entire Dropbox/Google Drive to another cloud storage. Unfortunately it doesn't support iCloud, which I prefer to use. But now with Files.app and the better integration of other cloud storages I guess I could use another service. \n\n- Are there other services like this one? Are there any hardware solution? Let's say I buy the 256GB device so that all photos can be downloaded to the phone, is there a harddrive with lightning cord that you can plug into the device and back everything up?\n\nI know the device can backup to iCloud when charging, which is nice, but all photos or the content of iCloud Drive are not included in the backup. They will manually be fetched if you restore from the backup. So I'm still at risk if I mistakingly mess with my iCloud files, or if someone [hacks my iCloud](http://wccftech.com/apple-icloud-ransomware-campaign/).\n\nI'm sure other people must have thought of going iOS only (especially now after iOS11), are there any posts here or blog post that discuss this matter?\n\nEdit: found https://www.kingstongo.com/us/usb/datatraveler-bolt-duo-flash-drive-for-iphone. Unfortunately it can only backup photos and videos. Let\u2019s hope that iOS 12 allows for external drives to show up in Files.app, then we have a real winner. ",

Specifically, when I\u2019m wearing my headphones, music randomly pauses, switches btwn Spotify & Apple Music- it\u2019s very odd.  I just updated to latest patch 11.0.1, and while it remedied quite a few issues from the initial release (the control center Music tile being faulty), I\u2019m really regretting updating so soon. \n\nTo be honest I usually update at least a month after release so they can smooth things out a bit, but I fell into that hype spell while watching a coworker play w their phone and gawk at the new enhancements.  \n\nSo I guess my questions to you are: 1) HAE experienced this thus far? And, 2) is it possible for me to downgrade to the last iOS 10 release without a computer (I don\u2019t currently own a personal laptop)? \n\nThanks in advance!",

Why oh why are you so fucking stupid?\nWhy can't we have grouped notifications? It's 2017 for God's sake\nI also don't like no fast charging\nI'm so spoiled by OnePlus 3's dash charge that nothing will live up to it though tbf\n\nWell those are my short points of someone who's been with Android since 2.1\nI'm happy to say that ios11 feels damn great and I wouldn't regret using this as my daily driver at all.",

            "selftext": "*UPDATE: My initial glad was to drain out the battery as it was stuck in the endless boot loop and after a while, my phone somehow fixed itself. The battery didn\u2019t drain as much since It was at 92%.*\n\n\n**BACKGROUND INFORMATION**\nA few days after the iOS 11 update, my iPhone 7's cellular signal has been inconsistent stating \"no service\" or \"searching\" for long periods of time. This happens inside my home and outside. Usually I'm able to connect to my cellular network inside my house, but it's been malfunctioning lately.\n\n**TO FIX THE CELLULAR PROBLEM, I'VE TRIED...**\n\n* Restarting the iPhone \n* Removing the SIM card, gently wiping the SIM card, and blowing inside the SIM card tray hole\n* Resetting Network Settings multiple times, and turning ON and OFF Airplane Mode a numerous amount of times.\n* Checking for a Carrier Update \n* Fiddling with cellular settings such as turning OFF LTE or changing settings within the LTE settings. \n* Fiddling with Date and Time settings because apparently setting the date and time automatically causes issues.\n* *None of these resolved the problem*\n\n\nWhen I tried updating my phone to iOS 11.0.1 when the phone was not connected to a cellular network, even if I was connected to wi-fi, I was prompted with the \"Unable to Verify Update iOS.\" Yesterday, I miraculously obtained a cellular connection and was able to update my phone to iOS 11.0.1 thinking it would fix my cellular problem. It didn't. When I woke up this morning, the phone was back to \"searching\" or \"no service\" even though it was already connected to the Verizon network **before** and **after** the update. \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**HOW THE BOOT LOOP STARTED**\nDuring the day, my phone turned itself OFF and ON again prompting me to enter my passcode. This happened about two times with about 4 minutes in between. A few minutes later, my phone turns OFF again and attempts to restart, but this time it never passes the Apple logo. It displays the Apple logo for a few seconds and then the Apple Logo would disappear for few seconds. It would then display the logo again and then disappear. This cycle never ends. \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**WHAT I'VE TRIED**\n\n* If i try to put the phone in recovery mode while not connected to a PC, it shuts the phone off. \n\n* If i try to put the phone in Recovery Mode while connected to iTunes, iTunes prompts me to \"Update\" my phone stating that it will attempt to reinstall iOS while also keeping my files. Once it tries to install, the iPhone restarts showing the Apple logo with a loading circle underneath, which turns into the loading bar that shows up when you're updating your phone. The loading bar shows up for less than a second then the screen goes black, and the iPhone restarts and automatically launches Recovery Mode. The 4013 error is displayed. iTunes does not recognize the phone plugged in after displaying the error so I would need to replug the lightning cable to the phone. Keep in mind that the iPhone is still on the Recovery Mode screen. iTunes then prompts that the phone cannot be \"Updated\" and I must factory reset the iPhone and optionally restore from a back up after the factory reset. The same things happens. \n\n* I've tried other programs such as **3u Tools** to reinstall iOS. I've tried reinstalling the new Beta iOS 11.1 and the more stable iOS 10.3.3. The same glitch happens where the phone displays the loading bar momentarily before restarting and heading back to Recovery Mode ultimately voiding the update.\n\n**Has anyone dealt with this or would like to provide any more things to try? I've never had a problem with an iPhone before when it comes to software, but could it be possible that this is a hardware issue?**",

But why is 11.0.1 so much smaller than the initial 11 update? Wouldn't updating now from 10.3.3 technically include an update that includes some kind of combination of 11 and 11.0.1?

The majority have been moans and complaints from the relatively minor to the (supposed) major issues.\n\nPersonally, I'm not a complainer and I think I've been very lucky with iOS updates in the past in that I've had relatively few problems. I have experienced some minor issues, some that other have voiced opinions about, but they have been so minor that they don't matter or I know that they'll be fixed in a future update.\n\nMy question to those that constantly find fault in iOS and continue to complain about the OS/Apple/devices is, why do you still own an Apple device? What makes you stay? Surely, judging by the amount of complaints, people would have moved on to other manufacturers by now. And yet, next year when the next iOS update comes out, I'm sure we'll see \"regulars\" who will find fault once more. So what makes you stick with Apple?\n\n\nJust curious.",

            "selftext": "Hi guys. First post here. Did a search for s true tone thread to no avail. Can anyone provide SPECIFICS of what True Tone actually does? How it affects color management and white balance, what input in particular it uses to make what adjustments? Apples explanations seem very vague, mentioning it adjusts colors to give a natural feel in any lighting. \n\nI\u2019m asking because I am running iOS 11 on my 9.7 iPad Pro. I use it almost exclusively for comic books in the Comixology app. Comixology provides VERY high res and quality, accurate digital comics and graphic novels. I\u2019ve toyed with plenty of screens on different tablets and have had most iterations of the iPad since it dropped originally. No device has been able to come close to the image you get on an apple device w retina. Not even on higher spec\u2019d android or windows devices. Now, I love the night mode feature apple offers. I used to jailbreak for the feature via flux. That said, I always turn it off when reading comics, because it obviously, greatly affects CMS and white balance in particular. I\u2019ve been experimenting with true tone in its place, but I\u2019m having trouble deciding  altering the colors to a degree where I\u2019m no longer seeing the image the way it was intended. That is usually the case when white balance is altered (aside from being ISF calibrated, which I am certified in, but have no clue how to incorporate that skill for an iPad lol) though iPads appear to be extremely accurate right out of the box. \n\nTrue Tone seems to be polarizing over on Twitter. Despite that, I haven\u2019t been able to find any true technical information on the feature. I do like what I\u2019m seeing this far, but if it is compromising the colors intended to be presented, I\u2019d rather not use it.  Colorization is one of the most crucial parts of design and presentation of a comic book. My entire collection is digital and I\u2019ve invested thousands into it, and devices. I just want to make sure I\u2019m getting as close of a recreation of true paper-printed pages as is possible! \n\nCan any of you share your experience thus far with true tone? Or somewhere I can research the issue further? Always looking to talk to other color obsessed techies, comic nerds, and iPad lovers, so sound off if you can relate to any of this. \n\nThanks!\n\n\nTLDR: I want to make sure True Tone is not messing with color accuracy on my iPad Pro!

I've even gone as far as reinstalling the app, and that hasn't worked either.  \n\nI just need a solution fast because once the busy season hits at my work in just over 2 months, I need to be sure that I'll be able to track a scanner down should it happen to be misplaced.

Couple of minutes later, I noticed my home button wasn\u2019t clicking. \n\nSilent button also didn\u2019t work (vibrating when switched on).

That's the subreddit idea, right? I just think people should search if someone already post the question/bug (with tools like [that](https://www.reddit.com/r/Enhancement/wiki/index/filters/filtereddit)) and stop the spamming of same posts.\n\n* **Edit 2:** And about the whole \"go complain to Apple\" thing. I thing big websites like reddit, have a huge community that can call Apple attention to the iOS/iDevices problems. You guys know that, just don't be an asshole.\n\n* **Edit 3:** Serious, again? My problem it's not with the battery issues posts. I think people **should** post that, but not **spam** that. Create one huge post to call Apple attention and another one with the possible solutions to it and upvote it! In that cenario, people will open the iOS subreddit and see their problem over there, fixed, and they won't need to post \"My battery is draining faster!\".\n\n* **Edit 4:** There are people who still think that I have a problem with the posts of battery. Do you guys think my battery is ok? Do you think that I don't want Apple fix that ASAP? Please, read the fucking thread before comment anything.\n\nSorry about my english, not my main language.

I didn't rip the whole album, just the tracks I wanted. I then edited the track info to ensure that Artist and Album Artist were saying the same thing, I have unticked \"compilation\". They're just stand alone tracks now.\n\nThey're displaying correctly on iTunes on my PC, but on my phone they are all coming up as \"Various Artists\" - and I don't mean that they're just all under \"V\" the artist is still displayed alphabetically correctly, but the name has been changed to \"Various Artists\" - so for instance:\n\nI ripped some Dean Martin songs from an old Rat Pack CD, and now, when I scroll through the iOS app I see:\n\nDamian Rice\nDavid Bowi\nDavid Brent\nVarious Artists\nDeep Purple\nDepeche Mode\n\nThe same is true for lots of other songs and artists - just spattered throughout my library on my phone is a whole load of \"Various Artists\".\n\nAnyone else seeing this?

I have an iPhone 7 128GB and it was laggy after the iOS 11 update (I didn't do the beta, straight OTA from 10.3.3) and my phone was a bit laggy with terrible battery life. I waited a few days to see if it was just \"indexing\" but that didn't fix it. After doing a full DFU restore and then restoring my backup I can confidently say that battery and performance are much better. I had lag opening apps, clicking a text message thread and it taking a second to open it, app switching, etc. It's all fixed now! Give it a shot if you have these issues too. ",

            "selftext": "I'm currently looking into audiobook apps to replace the default iBooks app, as it has begun performing poorly (not placing bookmarks automatically all the time, and often resetting in case of many files).\n\nI've considered Overcast, as I already love how it performs for podcasts, but as I've learned it only handles single files, and that's not very sustainable, as many audiobooks come with multiple mp3 files. Or, this would be sustainable, if there was a good, and reliable program for windows which could combine mp3s into one big file, but after looking around, it is hard to find one that isn't bloatware or that works well (though I'd love to hear any tips in regards to this).\n\nAnother one I've found is [Bound](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bound-audiobooks-from-the-cloud/id1041727137?mt=8), which seems good in theory, but it doesn't  mention how it handles multi file audiobooks. In itunes you're able to select multiple files and group them together to one book quite easily, or switch from music to audiobook, and rename things. This app doesn't touch on any of those things in the description, and I haven't found any video or the like to put my fears to rest.\n\nI've also seen a couple of others, but they were worse than Bound, so I stopped researching it, and figured I'd ask here. I don't really want to spend money on an app that turns out to be essentially useless for the needs I have, so I'm hoping someone here knows of a good and easy to use audiobook app (please don't say audible or the like) that suits my needs.\n\nThanks!",

I'm trying to update to ios 11, but the internet being as shitty as it is here, I went the download IPSW->restore route (my iPad may also be jailbroken *wink). I have an iPad air 2 with cellular, can anyone tell me if the link here (here's where I downloaded from) is for the cellular or the wifi version of the iPad, or if both are the same? I don't want to mess up.\n\nAlternatively, if anyone can provide me with the MD5 of the correct download, I can compare against the one I have. Any help would be appreciated.\n\nThanks!",

However, since downloading 11 a couple days ago I've already had 3 or 4 apps just straight up crash, with no response so I just end up waiting and then eventually restarting it. It isn't just one app; once it was tweetbot, once it was a game I play, and I believe the last time was spotify. \n\nAs for the music player bug, I put on a song the other day before driving home and noticed that it wasn't playing on the CC music player, so I couldn't control it with my apple watch? Even when I closed Spotify, tried to play a song in Music to fix it it didn't work, so I had to restart. Anyone else have these issues? \n\n",

I just wanted to see if I was missing something simple as that behavior seems a little strange.

(Which I assume is the goal for a company that ran the \u2018There\u2019s an app for that\u2019 campaign.)\n\nThe home screen, at least to me, seems to reinforce the behaviour of using a few apps regularly and giving the users \u201capp fatigue\u201d from the pages of apps. \n\nI have tried a few methods:\n\n- similar apps on the same line (folder + 3 most used). I tended to only use the 3. \n\n- all similar apps in a folder. This worked all right. \n\n- verb based folder names. Similar as the above folder method but use verbs like \u201cread\u201d or \u201cwatch\u201d. Probably the best method I\u2019ve come across. The problem with this is I had a bunch of folders in the dock and iOS 11 removed the label in the dock. \n\n- similar apps per page. This is my current idea. Have things like productivity apps on one page, read on another, etc \n\nAnyone do some interesting organizing of their apps?",

Would i lose all those save games? i know i could redownload the app but does using icloud back up your offline profiles and saves in games? I'm a bit paranoid about turning it on coz i don't want it syncing stuff from the phone and the computer, is this simple and easy to disable?

It spins \"forever\" (>7mins) a while with \"Turning off\" and then when I go to settings again it shows it still on. \n\nI'm suspicious that it won't let me turn it off until it is finished \"turning it on\".

Using _Open in\u2026_, I can scan it and click _Open in\u2026_. It switches me directly into GoodNotes no hassle. With drag and drop, I need to drag and hold it while I open the dock and launch GoodNotes which is slower than using _Open in\u2026_ and requires some finger gymnastics.\n\nSecondly, it's weirdly implemented. A useful thing to do in GoodNotes would be to start dragging pages from one notebook into a second and transfer them, but for some reason, dragging between the same app doesn't work. I suppose it might be an app-specific issue but still, it's weird and diminishes the usefulness of drag and drop.\n\nThirdly, it's unreliable. I was dragging something I drew in GoodNotes into Skype, and instead of just sending an image, it sent an OCR'd version of it. While I understand that Skype hasn't been updated which may be a reason why this happened, I tried the same thing in telegram where it wouldn't even accept my drag at all. That is particularly strange because I can copy and then paste the drawing just fine into Telegram.\n\nSo there you have it. That's what I think about drag and drop.",

I lack the budget to upgrade the phone, nor do I really see a great value in doing so when the tools work well now as they are; however, the extra features and security of upgrading to the latest version of the operating system are very compelling.\n\nHas anyone else who edits raw photos and large video files in VSCO or iMovie noticed lag or crashes post-upgrade?

If it was added then it will show a **CAPITAL** Eszett.\n\n- Be sure that you set your keyboard to capital before you test it, because the lowercase one is definitely already there.\n\nThank you very much :)",

            "selftext": "Hey guys. Recently I have had the problem of delay with my bluetooth headphones (Audiotechnica ARH-sr5bt). I load up a youtube video and the audio is half a second to a second behind. Its driving me insane but only started happening a couple days ago. I can only assume its ios 11. It was fine before and they are insync with my pc over bluetooth. I can see the lag when using the keyboard. I press a key and a second later the press sound is made. When playing videos, the video starts and then so does the audio. If I then double click the home button, the audio remains then goes. \n\n\n\nAnyone else with this issue or know any fixes? \n\n\nI forgot to add it comes and goes. When i went to open a youtube video it was fine, and typing this now it is again out of sync",

            "selftext": "For a native App pitched as a providing finder type functionality, quite frankly, the files app is total garbage.   It doesn't even come close to providing the functionality anyone hoped for in something called \"Files\".  How does Apple think this is a valuable addition to iOS 11?\n\nWhat most users wanted:\n\n* Ability for the user to create folders to organize ....their files\n\n* Ability to copy files from network shares to the iPad\n\n* Ability to copy files from a computer via USB into user created folders\n\n* Ability to copy photos on and off of the device\n\n* Ability to open files with an application that can use them of our choice (not internally in the files app)\n\nWhat did we get instead?\n\n* A cloud browser that is fully functional for iCloud but has only a half baked small pop up window for other cloud services such as Google drive\n\n* Sandboxed top level folders that only applications that support the new APIs can create and use.\n\n* The limitation that iOS has always had that requires you to share/copy objects to other apps instead of being able to access the same file from multiple apps...What is the fucking point of even trying to organize files Apple if we still have to maintain 5 copies inside different apps.\n\n\nI\u2019m sorry but I don\u2019t buy the claim that not being able to access files from apps is a valid security philosophy.  It compromises usability far too much.  Literally all computers (Mac, pc, apple ][, Commodore 64) and android phones have always had a file system for decades that multiple apps can access.  We\u2019re not talking about sharing libraries or executables between applications, we\u2019re talking about static user data.\n\nComplexity as far as the user experience goes isn\u2019t a valid argument either.  My 80 year old grandmother understands the concept of putting a file in a folder.  Most people know how to manage saving and retrieving files, and if they don\u2019t, then they don\u2019t have to worry about it.  Is anyone really confused about copying files to a USB stick in 2017?\n\nHaving a filesystem has never been a barrier to entry on any other GUI based OS, why does Apple continue to be so stubborn about this on iOS (while pretending to add useful functionality)?  It only limits usability for anyone that wants to use an iOS device for more than browsing the web and using Facebook (a real shame when the devices are becoming so powerful and capable of much more).  Having to do gymnastics to copy files between apps, share things up to the iCloud (if you have WiFi, if not then screw you), download them back to your PC through a web browser, or using custom WiFi upload/download tools inside apps, is not easier or a better user experience than simply copying a file to or from the device with a USB Cable like every digital camera, android phone, usb flash drive, etc. out there.\n\nSteve Jobs had a vision where we wouldn\u2019t need to worry about file systems anymore and I understand that\u2019s where the original iOS concept came from, but it didn\u2019t pan out and is now nothing but a hinderance.  It is time to adapt Apple.",

            "selftext": "I cannot be the only one that notices major issues with iOS 11, right? I've been using the beta since it was first released and noticed, that Apple did make some changes from build to build, BUT most of the times major issues weren't fixed properly. Actually, I still believe that the \"Feedback\" Application was just a dummy that didn't really do its job. \n\nI cannot remember in which build the bluetooth connection started to go south but as far as I can remember it was build 8. On certain bluetooth devices (like the radio in my car) the bluetooth connection just starts to disconnect and reconnect randomly. If you look at the new Control Center while this is happening you will notice, that bluetooth is \"turned off\" for just a few seconds before it's turned back on. During this process you are unable to manually activate or deactivate bluetooth. A friend of mine has the exact same iPhone with exactly the same build: same result. \n\nThe 3D touch animation also has frame lags, started to notice this in an early build as well.\n\nBut here's my favourite: The calculator. Go ahead and try it yourself. Try to add the numbers 1,2 and 3. Now, if you are quick on the draw you will automatically type in those numbers fairly fast, hitting the \"+\" every time in between. Your result should be 6. You will see that it's 23. So now, what happened? I figured if you type in numbers too fast and hitting the \"+\" operator in between for example, the calculator won't recognize the last operator you pressed. This results in an calculator I cannot use, because now you are unable to type in numbers fast. You literally have to wait in between, so the calculator doesn't freak out. \n\nI think I submitted every of those problems at least 3 times in each build. And I wasn't the only one. But yet it seems like Apple was so focused and pressured on releasing a new piece of software, that they completely forgot to listen to their customers. \n\nI'd like to know if you found bugs as well and if you have the same bugs as I do.

            "selftext": "So I know this issue has been around since 2010, and I haven't been able to find any solution to it whatsoever. There are some apps on my iPhone and iPad that won't show up in my purchase history, no matter how many times I delete/redownload them.\n\nTo illustrate my point, let's use Twitter. It's an app on my iPhone and iPad that I've downloaded and it runs perfectly. However because it won't show up in my purchased/downloaded list, I am unable to leave a review for it. I get an error saying you must own or download the item before you can write a review (even though I've downloaded the app with my Apple ID, logged into it, used it, and then sought to write a review). When I delete and reinstall the app, instead of showing a cloud icon, it just says \u201cGet\u201d and it re-downloads the app from the App Store without linking it to my Apple ID again. I also have automatic downloads enabled but for all my apps, but it does not automatically download these apps which don't show up in my downloads/purchase history (after I\u2019ve deleted it from my iPhone and iPad and re-download it). \n\nI\u2019ve logged out of the App Store and logged back in. I\u2019ve logged out of iCloud and logged back in. I\u2019ve restarted my phone after being logged out and then redownloading the apps, but they still won\u2019t show up in my purchase history and won\u2019t link to my Apple ID. \n\nThis issue started for me on iOS 10. Im currently running iOS 11 on an iPhone 6s, and iPad Air 2. \n\nIs there anyone out there who can help me? My biggest fear is that some apps which I've actually paid for will end up getting removed from my purchase history and I will lose my investment and all associated data with them",

            "selftext": "While iOS 11 gives us many great changes some are really weird and others really bad design choices.\n\nOne in particularly more than others: the new Notification Center is now the lock screen. But why did Apple do this? iPhone X\n\nIt makes the most sense when you remembers that in iPhone X the lock screen is a \u201cswipe up\u201d gesture to unlock. So it\u2019s natural that when you swipe down it get you back the lock screen. \n\nOk so it doesn\u2019t look like a bad design choice on the new iPhone X, but what about the others iphone?\n\nWell.. It really screws the Notification Center, first because we don\u2019t get nothing new or better, we just lose screen space, the search bar and even the transparency look it has was better than the new one. \n\nAnother thing that really looks like a waste, other than the really big clock and date, is the media controls that appears in the Notification Center now... i know that it makes sense when you remember that the Notification Center is the lock screen and all but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s something normal to have when we swipe down to access and read our notifications. First of all.. it\u2019s redundant to have it in notifications when we already have a media control in control Center and second off it just takes a lot of screen space.\n\nOn the iPad it also has another bad design choice, it changes the widget painel. Instead of having 2 column when in landscape mode we now have a single one, and because of landscape mode, it\u2019s very bad to see and use widget now with the reduced screen height.\n\nThe only thing this change give us is something we don\u2019t need... a shortcut to access camera when in Notification Center and you swipe left.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Is there any chance Apple change this in upcoming iOS 11 updates or ever? Because it just fell like they are moving towards the new iPhone X huge screen space with this iOS and ignoring every other device.",

The wifi button is completely useless now.\n\n2) that small window that contains the media controls? Good luck trying to tap one of the three buttons it displays. Every time I go to tap pause-play it skips forward or back instead. It's impossible to tap the skip button they are so small. The window is simply too small to hold 3 buttons.\n\n3) Why is there no volume dial for Ringer/Alerts? We can adjust playback volume in two places within the control center. But no where can we adjust the volume of the ringer or alerts coming from Alarm or Timer etc. Why isn't one of the volume dials in the control center set to adjust Ringer/Alerts?\n\nApple has really put out a turd with this new control center.\n",

Since then, we have closed ~30 of them with plans to close the majority of the rest to be used for different purposes. All equipment is ripped from each closed store, along with an iPad Mini. \n\nFor some, I know the passcode, however I do not know the Apple ID and cannot factory default them.  Some are on the activation lock screen, one of them is stating it is disabled for the next 26 million seconds!\n\nI've attempted connecting them to iTunes, entering recovery mode, but none of this works. \n\nI spoke with Apple UK Support who transferred me through to their Enterprise Team who would usually deal with this as it's a bulk issue, but they require proof of purchase which I cannot supply. They will not accept documentation stating that we have bought parts of the company that originally purchased the iPads. \n\nWe do not have a working relationship with the company that purchased them, thus I can't obtain a proof of purchase. \n\nTL;DR: Need to factory default a large batch of iPad Minis without a passcode, Apple ID or proof of purchase. \n\nThank you",

Further, when you click on a file, it opens in the wrong app, with no way to change it. For instance, when I tap on a PowerPoint presentation, it tries to open Google Drive. Why? And I have yet to find out how to change it! Overall, I am frustrated with how many bugs there are in iOS 11. I have already had numerous freezes and crashes with stock apps. I am running an iPhone 6s, and iPad Pro 9.7. But this is not a good upgrade. Further, in yet another bug, if you have volume control on with a bluetooth headset, you can override the volume control by using the volume changer on the headset itself. I have tried with PowerBeats and a Phaser model. What is the point of the volume limiter then? ",

Quite happy i made the switch, but there's one thing that's frustrating me and i hope you all can help.\n\nOn Android, there's an option for the alarm to fade in over a customizable period of time instead of just blasting at you at full volume. I couldn't find an option like this in the Clock app, so i decided that since i was having to convert all my custom tones from MP3 to M4R i might as well make the change directly in the file.\n\nSo, i used a sound editor to add a 20 second fade in to the audio file i use for my alarm tone, converted and uploaded to the phone. I've tried both MP3 (selecting from \"Songs\") or M4R versions, and playing them in the preview mode while selecting does play with the fade in... however, when my alarm goes off in the morning it starts at full volume and shocks me out of sleep.\n\nDoes anyone know if there's a way to stop the alarm from normalizing the volume on this tone, and have it play as it is?",

There are multiple things you can do to \"fix\" them:\n\n* update your phone using 100% battery and while it is still plugged in to charger. No technical explanation. This is more like something that I do since the times I was using Android.\n\n* restart the phone after 3-4 hours (after the update) and after another 3-4 hours again. Between the restarts, the phone will do some caching and some apps may \"hang\" in the background.\n\n* **disable AirDrop**. No, really. Disable AirDrop. I know 4 persons (including me) that saw extremely bad battery life in iOS11. After looking through the menus, I saw that AirDrop is enabled. Disabling it doubled the battery life for us. Even though we had AirDrop disabled before upgrading, it got enabled automatically afterwards.\n\n* wait for a couple of days. You will see a speed improvement after those days. This makes me think that your phone will not do stuff in the background and this may result in better battery life.\n\nI know this is old news, but i would consider it a success if it stops 10 people from creating topics with this problem.",

            "selftext": "The podcast app has always felt somewhat neglected in previous updates. iOS 11 has given it some design attention in line with the rest of the update. \n\nFor the record. I listen to potentially several hours of podcasts per day due to my job (see user name).\n\nFirst impressions.... Apple has made the app borderline unusable for me now. It\u2019s really a monstrosity of a redesign.\n\nBefore I tolerated the slow update speeds of the feed but at least it was somewhat intuitive and ordered. Now I\u2019m losing screen space to \u201cRecently Played\u201d. Why would I want to know what I recently played in such a prominent position? Podcasts aren\u2019t music. \n\nAlso.. every time I download or add to \u201cplay later\u201d (previously \u201cUp Next\u201d) my screen is filled with the notification telling me what I\u2019ve done in the same way that raising and lowering volume obscures the view and useability on the screen... which is obstructing and annoying.\n\nA positive is that the design does look cleaner in many ways and is consistent with all other native iOS apps.\n\nAll in all. I\u2019ll give it a couple of days to see how I adjust (I\u2019m hoping it\u2019s a pre-coffee freak out). I feel that they missed the mark with what they were aiming for here and have chosen to go with overall design consistency within iOS 11 and not focused on the podcast app as it is used functionally.  My gut says that it may be time to try out a third party app. \n\nSuggestions or thoughts?\n\nThanks.\n",

The 6s plus and Air 2 have quirks.\n\nI'm making a post here in case the apple devs are lurking around for bug reports. I have done a full reset on the iPad and 6s+. Here are my observations...\n\n1. Battery drain is noticeably quicker on the 6s+ and Air 2. Its about 1% for every 3-5 minutes of on screen time. My test is not scientific, but it is certainly worse than 10.3.3\n\n2. Settings app - you search for something, go to the setting sub-section and navigate back, there's an invisible section which pushes things down and now all the touch targets are off. Noticed in the 6s. Not in the Air 2.\n\n3. All sorts of small issues with alignment of text controls - open messages, the keyboard expands, then pushes stuff up and out and now you can't see the last message . Noticed in Messages and Whatsapp. Can't be app specific, looks like a text input control issue. Noticed on the 6s plus. \n\nedit 1: \n\n4. 3D touching the settings app doesn't always take you to the desired shortcut; especially after searching for something, navigating to a different app and then trying to get to a shortcut with 3D touch. \n\n\n5. If you edit the apps available to you in messages, clicking on Done wont minimise/take you back to messages. ",

One thing I noticed which I did not read much about from previous reviews and introductions, is that the behavior of the Wifi/bluetooth/hot-spot toggle in the control center has changed.\n\n\nSo when you press the button, you are not turning it on and off, but rather connect and disconnect from the current network. If you press the wifi button when you have a wifi connection, the icon will go grey, but when you check in settings, the wifi is still on, just not connected. The same thing goes for bluetooth and hot-spot.\n\n\nI'm not so sure what the reasoning is behind this change. Though I was told it will not consume much energy if left on but idle, still I am a little worried about the impact on battery life. Also together with the \"adaptive\" airplane mode, the behavior of toggles in the new control center seems a bit confusing to me. At the very least, it requires some time to get used to.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\n\n**EDIT**: I thought if you disconnected from a network from control center, your phone would not attempt to connect to other networks and the wifi module would stay idle, but I was wrong. I pressed the wifi toggle and disconnected from the network in my office and when I got home I was connected to the wifi in my house. I start to wonder what is the point of having this toggle then?",

I don't remember which beta it happened for, but out of nowhere all of this disappeared (Friends are Listening To, my own profile, my friend's profiles, recommended friends, etc).\n\nI thought with the GM it would finally reappear, but it never did. I even went so far as to downgrading back to 10.3.3 with an IPSW file, and upgraded to iOS 11 when it hit for everyone. Still nothing.\n\nA friend of mine who was never on the beta upgraded to iOS 11 today, and noted that he also doesn't see any of these new features in his Apple Music. He didn't get the launch day card explaining all of the new stuff, and \"Start Sharing With Friends\" isn't in his settings.\n\nHoping to see if anyone else has this missing from their AM app on iOS 11? Any theories as to why it might be missing? (FWIW my iMac and iPad mini both have all of these features, just my iPhone is acting up)\n\nEDIT: Found a fix with help from a MacRumors forum poster -- \"If you have no social elements available when you tap your avatar it's because you've blocked Apple Music \"Connect\" in Restrictions.

            "selftext": "Yesterday I was finally able to get my hands on a set of AirPods (so far, they're fantastic).  It got me thinking about combining them with the upcoming LTE iWatch and a potential phoneless iOS experience.  I work a job that requires me to carry a workphone on me, which means I have two phones in my pocket the majority of the day.  It would be amazing if I could leave my personal phone at home and just use the watch/AirPod combo while I'm working.\n\nJust curious what the real-life experience would be like?  Is this something that should be completely possible and seamless, or would battery life be an issue?  I understand the watch is not yet released, so no real life battery data yet to go off of, but I'm curious if people think this would be a limiting factor, or if there are other issues I'm not thinking of.

I didn\u2019t really like it, so I restored to iOS 10.3.3.\n\nI discovered that lots of third party apps have a significant difference in fluency between the two iOS versions. I\u2019m mostly talking here about FPS drops in apps like SimCity BuildIt, Google Maps (while scrolling on a map) and MyFitnesspal. It doesn\u2019t seem to happen on native apps like Apple Maps.\n\nI\u2019ve already tried the following:\n- Do a clean install of iOS 10.3.3\n- Reduce motion & Reduce transparency\n- Reset the iPhone\n- Reinstall apps\n\nThe phone was not hot during the process and it has been almost 4 days since the install, so indexing is not an option here. Is there any way how I can fix this, or should I just wait for 11.1?\n\nThanks for reading\n",

Unless I remove the DRM from the iTunes Videos (which is an option I suppose), a third party video app is not the most ideal way about this.\n\nI've tried enabling restrictions on practically everything, but this usually doesn't remove the tabs, but rather makes the tabs less helpful and more confusing.

            "selftext": "After using iOS 11 on my iPad Air 1 (oldest device capable of running iOS 11), here\u2019s my opinion on why upgrading to iOS 11 is almost a necessity even in its current state (It\u2019s still pretty rough around the edges with slowdowns and bugs)\n\n1) Anyone who uses their device for media consumption, the ability to natively play flac audio files and hevc video files alone is worth the upgrade. I have a lot of media in hevc(x265) and previously it was a pain to convert it every time I had to view it on my iPad. Same goes for my flac lossless audio collection. Now I can finally stop converting tracks to alac every time I have to add them to my device (or avoid using third party players).\n\n2) Scrolling is much smoother and way less stickier than previous iterations . A single flick can now scroll a web page  end to end. Same goes for in app scrolling as well.\n\n3) Drag and drop enables for much better experience in gallery when re-arranging media\n\n4) If you store your music on the cloud, the files app works wonders to access your media on various cloud platforms in one single window.\n\n5) Media playback can now be controlled from both the cover sheet(Notification Center) and the control center.\n\nI\u2019m sure there are other features I\u2019m missing here that enhance the media consumption experience but these are the ones that stood out to me.\n\nP.S. : I seriously hope apple improves the performance in future iterations.

I'm also wondering why the screen mirroring button is 2 icons wide (wheras this is impossible for the other icons).\n\n\nAnother issue with control center is that it doesn't rotate.

My thinking is that people with arthritis or dexterity issues could have difficulty with swipe to unlock or opening multitasking.\n\nThe more interesting discussion is whether people will activate it as they prefer a traditional, yet on screen home button AT provides. I've been an iOS user since the iPhone 5 and love it. I love my 6 too. But personally i feel removing the home button was the wrong idea. I like the Samsung galaxy S8 approach to the home button. for those who dont know how it works:\n\nThe Galaxy S8 has a press-sensitive area at the bottom of its display where the on-screen home button sits (3D touch essentially limited to one area). This area allows you constant access home no matter what you are doing. So even if the button isn\u2019t showing (Eg: you are in a full screen app), you can touch the area with a bit of extra pressure (\u201chard press\u201d) and the phone will return home. \n\nThis would work on the lock screen too on the iPhone. This would simply mean Apple specifying that force touch not be used in the bottom area of apps. Not a huge ask.\n\nI would love to see a jailbreak for this feature. I've never jail broken before, but that would do it for me if its implemented properly.\nOpinions?",

App suggestions in the bottom left corner of the lock screen when you\u2019re at a physical location of an app you have installed. I.e - Grocery stores, banks, etc... This also triggers for music app when headphones are plugged in or if it knows you use Facebook the same time every day. I do get music controls in the new notification style control pop up when I plug in headphones, but it still doesn\u2019t show the app icon in the corner for easy access to the app. \n\n2. Traffic Conditions/Estimated Travel Times when connected to a car\u2019s Bluetooth. It still shows this information in the \u201cMaps Destinations\u201d widget, so I know the information is there, but it doesn\u2019t push a notification like it did in iOS 10. \n\nI imagine somethings need to be cut to make way for other features, but I want to make sure I\u2019m just not encountering a bug before I settle on the conclusion. \n\nThanks!",

It seems like a huge waste of resources to essentially try to catch up to Google, which will never happen. With Google's analytics, street view technology and presence, and cross platform availability, there really is no way that Apple actually thinks they could possibly have an edge... Right? The only people I know of that actually prefer Apple Maps are the ones who say they don't trust Google with their information.\n\nWhat gives?

This is incredibly annoying and I don't see how no one has mentioned this. How are you suppose to know if a device is connected via Bluetooth if its the SAME BOLD B symbol all the time? It only flashes at first when it connects to a device but on iOS 10 it was perfect as it would fade to grey when it's still on but not connected or being used by a device. I went back to iOS 10 since being apart of the betas up until the 10th one.\n",

As an IT professional (and storage and server engineer/architect) it's something I've never thought much about (on a computer or Android.  You simply copy the files you want to a directory (over SMB, SFTP, USB, whatever), work on them with whatever apps you need, and copy them off of the device when you're done, but that model just doesn't seem to fit in with the iOS ecosystem.  I feel like I'm trying to fit a square peg in an apple shaped hole.  I downloaded Readdle Documents and while it can copy files around like I'm used to, the files seem to be sanboxed entirely in an environment only visible to the app.  If I copy a ~~Movie~~ Linux ISO over with Documents from my nas, vlc or any other media player can't even see it, let alone play it.  The best it seems you can do is to get an app such as Infuse with built in copying support and copy files into it's little sandbox.\n\nFor a device that is supposed to be a part of a graphics, video, whatever workflow, how are you supposed to get files in and out of the device?  If the answer is (as I suspect) to save things to iCloud drive, how can I access those files if I'm in a place without an internet connection?  It doesn't make sense at all to edit video stored in the cloud without having a local copy...\n\nIt seems like the new files app on iOS 11 was supposed to create a sort of shared \"filesystem\" that you could access and copy files in an out of as you please, but it doesn't seem like it is ready for prime time yet and just serves as nothing more as a cloud client for multiple services.\n\nPlease help an Android user figure out iOS and it's quirky way of handling files.\n\n\nTL;DR: How do I get files on and off of my iPad pro to use it's 256GB and use them with the apps on the device?\n\n[Millions of people use iOS, surely I'm not the only one with this problem.](https://i.imgur.com/3RCBHnw.jpg)",

However, it's attached to her OLD Apple ID and she doesn't remember the password for it or for the email address attached to it. She doesn't remember the email address that's listed as a recovery email address for the apple ID email address....\n\nSo, I can't access the app store or reset the iPhone using my macbook (can't turn off Find My iPhone). I've found some YouTube videos that give instructions on how to turn off Find My iPhone without the password, but this phone is so old (iPhone 4) that it hasn't been verified, and so the fields referred to on those videos are greyed out/blank.\n\nThe Apple ID is attached to a hotmail email account, but the path to reset her password without using the recovery email says I don't have enough information (it asks for people she's emailed recently, but she has NEVER used that email address. She uses another one).\n\nLastly, I tried resetting the Apple ID with her security questions, but it won't accept the birthday linked to her account. I have no idea why she would use another birthday.\n\nI understand these are (effective) antitheft safety checks. Any ideas on how I can clear this? I have my original phone with me as well but I would like to use this one when going out at night so that if I DO get robbed it's not as big of a hit.\n\nEDIT: this is an AT&T phone. My grandma contacted AT&T to unlock it from their end before I left, but there is a process of unlocking you go through once you insert the new SIM card that requires you to use the original Apple ID. So, I cannot use the phone at all locally, even by using my own Apple ID in the App Store to download apps as suggested by u/ffiresnake down below.",

Almost all the apps I use on a daily basis can sync data to the cloud so that's not an issue. My only concerns are photos and videos. I have google photos backup enabled but since I shoot a lot of video and since all of them are in 4K I don't have enough mobile data to back them up to Drive or iCloud. I was thinking of using some software that makes a local backup of my entire camera roll and that can be restored after I install iOS 11. I don't wanna use iTunes cuz it also backs up all the junk I've accumulated on my phone over the past 3-4 years. \n\nAny suggestions ? ",

I am angry and feeling ripped of $20 , when I could have had other apps that were not subscription based,\nAll I have to say is you don't have to write blogs to justify why you had to **** your old customers and why you think it was necessary. \n\nFor someone like me who don't do cross platform with your app, and don't want that functionality, and don't want to pay for it, and yet paid $20, for a simple app (without knowing that it has no future support beyond iOS 11, I'm not asking for \"added\" features, it's good as is. But $20 for iOS app, that won't work on my iPad in 2018 when iOS 12 comes out is a hitch.\n\nAll the blogs you write , you were whining about how you can't make money. So you had to scew me . While you could simply have opted for subscription method for newbiws, but you wanted to **** the old customers. And knew your new customers may not see need of it. Because they have other options that you had to compete with to justify $20 from some one who will not use it on his Mac.\n\nIf you insist that it's a new program, then go name it something like what MS office did with office 365, call it Ulysses 365, and keep just updating current app to stay compatible with future iOS,  not just iOS 11, because iPads can support pretty much as a much as 4-5 Year upgrades. And if you can't  live by the standards of Apple, then stop demanding premium for that. I thought you cared about your customers. But I was wrong .\n\nI bought this app last December, and now it's gone subscription, that's injustice, I want my refund . And n case I don't.

Over the last week or two, I started to notice when I got to work it would be at 75% when normally it was close to 95%. Today, in just a matter of minutes playing music it went from 46% to 40%. It seems to be draining very fast.\n\nI've run every possible test. Diagnostic says battery is holding 93% of its original charge. I've shut off apps that might have background action going on. I've deleted any app I downloaded in the last 2 weeks (which is maybe one or two). Also it's been draining battery while on Wifi, too, so it's not bad cellular connection.\n\nI am going to a Genius Bar appointment tomorrow, but I fear they're just going to say \"it happens,\" and I will be stuck with a weird battery phone. Fortunately *it is* still apparently under some kind of technical warranty until January '18.\n\nI plan on upgrading to the iPhone 8 when it comes out using Verizon's 12 month installment plan. But in the meantime, I really want my phone's battery to not suck.\n\nAny ideas?!?\n\nAnd when I take it to Verizon, is it possible they'll just give me a new phone, or ship it somewhere? Should I bring an old iPhone 5 in case I need to have it up and running if I want a phone for the next few days?\n\nThanks everyone.",
