    "description": "Welcome Computer Science researchers, students, professionals, and enthusiasts!\n\nWe share and discuss content that computer scientists find interesting.\n\n### Guidelines\n\nSelf-posts and Q&A threads are welcome, but we prefer high quality posts focused directly on graduate level CS material. We discourage most posts about introductory material, how to study CS, or about careers. For those topics, please consider one of the subreddits in the sidebar instead.\n\n#### Want to study CS or learn programming?\n\nRead the original free [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html) (or see the [Online conversion of SICP](https://www.reddit.com/r/compsci/comments/60mgmv/beautiful_online_version_of_structure_and/) )\n\n#### Related subreddits\n\nOther optics are likely better suited for:\n\n* /r/cscareerquestions: Job, internships, etc..\n* /r/askcomputerscience\n* /r/learnprogramming: Resources for learning how to code. \n* /r/compscivideos: A collection of video content on academic and educational computer science topics.\n* /r/csbooks\n* /r/math: Despite popular misconceptions, Computer Science is mostly about math.\n* /r/programming: ...but we also occasionally implement things.\n* /r/algorithms: Another computer science subreddit (our hated nemesis, we will fight to the death)\n* /r/programminglanguages\n* /r/types\n* /r/machinelearning\n* /r/crypto\n* /r/dip: Image processing\n* /r/tinycode: Cool algorithms, tiny implementations. \n* /r/cseducation\n\nOther online communities:\n\n* [CS Theory Stack Exchange](http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/)\n* [Computer Science Stack Exchange](http://cs.stackexchange.com/)\n* [MetaOptimize: Machine Learning](http://metaoptimize.com/qa/)\n* [Lambda the Ultimate: Programming Languages](http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/)\n\nIf you are new to Computer Science please read our [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/compsci/comments/pkitn/frequently_asked_questions_on_rcompsci/) before posting.

Different games can have different controls, different worlds, different physics, but so many of them make use of a replay feature; tools that either replay what happened moments before you died, remember how you played a specific level, or maybe it stores a whole game worth of replay. The main question here - what method would be the most efficient in creating said replays? Would saving the input each frame be memory-efficient? Would saving a live video of the gameplay be time-efficient? What different methods exist for different games that make *their* replay system effective - and what tools would you use in a game you're designing?\n\nOther things that are interesting to discuss as a branch of this - how do replays affect the games? FPS games will use the replay feature to reveal a killer's location, potentially eliminating an element of stealth. Games like Super Meat Boy use it purely as a partially comedic element as well as a way to see how you improved over multiple attempts. Different games use their replay systems differently - how do they affect the game?",

            "selftext": "One of the biggest disadvantages of linked lists is that they are implemented over non-contiguous memory. This causes cache misses which slows performance. The traditional linked list implementation (as far as I know) consists of a bunch of nodes, where each node contains the value of the element and pointers to the next and previous nodes in the list. The problem is that when a new element is added, a new node is created somewhere in memory that could be quite far from the rest of the nodes, causing cache misses. But can't this be avoided?\n\nThe basic idea is that the linked list would be initialized with an expected capacity, say, C. Allocate memory for C contiguous nodes in memory. By default, the memory for these nodes would not be used (even though the memory is allocated). So keep track of these \"free\" nodes in, say, a free list. Then, whenever you wanted to insert a new element, instead of choosing some random memory location, you would choose one of the memory locations from the free list. The chosen memory location will be relatively close to the location of the other nodes. Thus, cache misses *should* be reduced (right?). So the implementation that I'm thinking of will be virtually identical to traditional linked lists; the only difference is that, when adding a new element/node, the memory will be chosen from a pre-allocated section of contiguous memory.\n\nOf course, there will be some additional work to do when the container exceeds the capacity. There would have to be some re-allocating, copying, etc. just as when a C++ vector, hash map, etc. exceeds the initially allocated capacity.\n\nOther than that, it seems like this retains the advantages of traditional linked lists (e.g. insertion to or removal from any index in constant time) while minimizing cache misses. Am I missing something? I searched around for a data structure like this but found *nothing*. There are 2 possible explanations for this: (1) I'm a genius and no one has thought of this before, or (2) there is something fundamentally wrong with this data structure idea (or my understanding of cache misses, memory, etc,), but I can't figure it out. EDIT: there's also a third possible explanation: this data structure *does* exist somewhere, but my Google searching skills have failed me.\n\nThoughts?",
