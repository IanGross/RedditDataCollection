My choices were between stats and physics, I chose stats.\n\nI'm looking at EU as can't afford US. Found several data science courses but they all (understandably) require several modules in computer science, which just weren't an option for me and I cant get them, credited anyway, it seems without doing a bachelor in CS which is overkill for what I need. (25-30 ECTS )\n\nOther options seem to just Masters in Statistics but many focus on things like SAS and don't seem to give me knowledge I'm missing in Computer Science. Feel like I will have tons of stats knowledge but no computer science knowledge. Obviuosly can pick up a lot online but feel like companies in Europe really want to see credited qualifications.\n\nSo I'm wondering if anyone has been in similar situation? having the math but not the CS? is there a workaround to getting into work as Data Scientist?\n\nIs a Masters in Stats worthwhile if I know i want to go into data science and the masters trains for traditional role in statistics, with no focus on CS needed for data science.\n\nI'd love to hear from people who also made the switch or people working in universities who have seen students like me successfully make the switch.

            "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nHow do you manage your projects in a corporate setting where multiple folks collaborate on a single project?  \n\nWhere are current doing \"a folder per project\" on a network drive. There, you find the following subfolders :   \n  \n- a \"data/raw\" subfolder, where we put the raw data, shapefile, etc..  \n- a  \"git\" folder for each collaborator  (git-username1, git-username2, etc..)  to clone the repo and work on the code.  That subfolder is built similar to [cookiecutter data science](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/).    The main difference is that we don't put the raw data there, because we don't want to create a copy of the data for each collaborator and we don't want to check it into git.   When we need to refer to the data, we'll refer to \"/../data/raw/\"  \n\nthere are also some extra folders such as  \n\n- \"mandate\" , where we put what is the goal of this project, who asked for it, what is the delivery date, etc..\n- \"litterature\" where we put pdfs from relevant book chapters, articles, blog posts, etc..\n\nThis works fine as long as the project is \"on going\".  When we will be done, we will delete all the \"git\" folders and simply leave a URL shortcut to the git repo so that someone can clone the latest version when needed.\n\nIf someone needs to take over the project a year from now, they will need two separate places:  \na) git repo for the code  \nb) data/raw folder  \n  \nI feel the code is safe on the internal git repo, but I'm  afraid for the data.  A well intentioned person could move or delete the data folder.    Worse, someone could edit the data without meaning to do it (I'm looking at you excel).  \n\nAlso, it is kind of an hassle while sharing projects between teams because we will have to ask IT to provide access to two different places (git AND data) instead of just one.\n\nHow do folks do it?  The datascience cookiecutter mentions the following:   \n  \n- AWS S3 with a syncing tool\n- Git large file storage\n- Git annex\n- Dat\n\nThis is corporate data, so we don't want to put it just anywhere. \n\nthanks\n\n\n",

The company is not data-driven at all, marketing does not track the effectiveness of social media, campaigns, emails into business results and I'm NOT on a mission to change the culture, but just to make sure my work is valuable and causes an impact.\n\nI was responsible for redesigning the website for my new company and it was really bad from a content and design perspective (didn't really sell well the strengths of the software). My boss was against tracking results on this website because he feels that people buy this product regardless of the content on the website. It's a desktop software similar to Autocad and people buy because they need for their work, so he feels that people compare the product by talking to coworkers in the industry and buys based on features or what the industry is using. However, I have a hypothesis that the redesign could do some sort of impact in the sales or conversion.\n\nI convinced him that doing a basic tracking to see the impact on sales and conversion would be nice, it would look good for the CEO and business people if we caused a good impact. If nothing good happens it's cool because nobody is expecting these numbers.\n\nThis is the process of buying the product:\n\n(homepage or product page) - > (goes to another subsite with online store) - > (login) - > (adds to the cart product version) - > (checkout).\n\nNote: we didn't touch the online store at all which is a separate website\n\nQuestion: If you don't have a lot of analytical historical data, but just sales data in a spreadsheet, what would be the best way to create a \"Framework\" to analyze the impact?\n\nI know they have google analytics installed on both properties, but they never did the setup properly, with filters and never used any data. I don't like G.A. myself because I've worked in other teams and it's very tricky to match numbers, and again goals with $$ numbers were never created in G.A. anyway, all the sales data is in our CRM.\n\nI was going to install Hotjar and create a simple conversion rate funnel from the website to the final step in the purchase (linking the store with the WordPress website) or maybe some sort of check on sales data to see any spikes.\n\nAny advice?\n",

I've been applying for data scientist/data analyst entry-level positions and have had a few interviews in the 3 weeks or so since I've graduated, but no full-time offers so far. I did recently get an offer for a 3-month paid data science internship with a startup that I'm interested in. My question is: in terms of a data science career, should I even bother with the internship or should I just wait it out until I can get a full-time job? Basically the choice is between spending the next 3 months interning at the startup or spending the next 3 months learning, doing personal projects, and applying for full-time jobs. Financially, I'm fine either way, but trying to figure out what the best route into a good full-time data science job is.",

Need advice on strategizing my job search and resume (and maybe interviewing too). Thanks!\n\n(Resume Link: https://imgur.com/a/vM1Fa)\n\nI graduated with an undergrad degree in May with a degree in  Economics and two minors in CS and Stats. I'm aspiring to become a data scientist but I realize that right now I need to find a data analyst job because this is what I'm most qualified for and it would be a good starting point to build my skill set and eventually become a data scientist.\n\nHowever, up to now I haven't had too much luck with my job search. I get some phone interviews and then a bunch of second or maybe even third round interviews, and I got to the final round of a interview process with a data consultancy once, but nothing has worked out yet and I'm not sure if my hit-rate for hearing back after throwing my resume out there is good enough. I've probably sent out ~200 applications or so but I haven't been customizing cover letters much besides names and minor changes. \n\nRecently I've been trying to focus more on reaching out to people on linkedin for informational interviews and career advice and I'm working on setting up a personal blog/site to put up small projects on which would act as a portfolio. While I've gotten a lot of good advice from phone calls with data scientist (not to be underestimated), it hasn't really helped me in getting a job in a direct way.\n\nGiven my experience through internships and my technical skills, I thought I would have a bit of an easier time finding a data analyst job - I like to think I'm a solid interviewer most of the time too. It's been about 4 months now and I'm starting to feel a bit desperate and at a loss for what I'm doing wrong. Any critiques, advice, or feedback would be much appreciated. \n\nI also just remade my resume after wondering if my previous resume was putting me in the throwaway pile and I'd love to get some critique (my previous resume was was more unconventional/creative). The resolution may be a little low in the screenshot, it isn't like that in the PDF form.\n\nHopefully some of this discussion also helps other recent grads in my position who are lurking around here as well. Sorry for the wall of text.\n",

I\u2019ve abstracted the problem to a different example to remove the domain knowledge you\u2019d otherwise need to make sense of it (though I might actually be making it worse\u2026).\n\nI have a large data set of people\u2019s actions, which I can supplement with additional information on how those people are connected. Each action has attributes such as person, type, extremity and time of occurrence. So an action might look like \u201cBill A., Yawn, Loud, Apr 1st 2016 1230\u201d. There are an enormous number (1000+) of different action types and 10's of thousands of different people.\n\nMy objective is to identify which actions are connected to each other. So for example if every single time a Father yawns, his daughter yawns too, you might consider that connected. While maybe only 10% of the time when a Mother yawns the son yawns too, these might not be considered related types of events. Or maybe the action of someone raising their voice causes their parents to raise their voices but their children to lower theirs. \n\nAny suggestions for tackling this badly explained problem?",

I graduated college in 2016 with a BS in ChemE and have been working full time as a process engineer since then. For all intents and purposes I have no background in programming or advanced statistics. After realizing how fun, versatile and lucrative a career in data science can be, I've decided to make a career switch into the field. \n\nNow, I've been slowly self learning and over the past year and I've managed to teach myself some Python and R, but I'm still missing out on other things like SQL,Tableau,etc. I figured that with enough time and practice I can get a hang of the programming aspect of DS. But it's been very difficult for me to learn HOW to actually understand, interpret and analyze the data I am working with. And for that I strongly believe that I would need the guidance of a teacher. That's why I've been strongly considering pursuing either a MS in DS or paying for bootcamps.\n\nI live in Chicago and Northwestern university has a great MS program for analytics ( http://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/analytics/overview/ ) as well as 24 week part time coding bootcamp( https://codingbootcamp.northwestern.edu ). I strongly believe that both of these programs will give me the skills and guidance I need to get establish a career in DS.(please correct me if this assumption is incorrect)\n\nThe way I'm looking at things now is, do the part time bootcamp while working fulltime(its more affordable that way), apply for jobs(hopefully land one successfully), work for a year or two saving up some money, and then apply for the MS in DS.\n\nIs this a good idea or am I just wasting my resources and effort with the bootcamp? Or is there another option I haven't even considered?\n\nThanks in advance! :)",

Just this past month, I sent out maybe 70 or so applications, and I only heard back from two places so far. The bulk of my applications were sent out about 3-4 weeks ago or so. \n\nI was wondering if anyone has any data on the timeframe to expect for hearing back for an interview? I've only gotten asked for an interview by 2 companies thus far (and maybe 10-20 rejections -- the majority being just days after applying), and I'm not too sure as to why.\n\n[This](https://i.imgur.com/k1oCz.png) is my anonymized resume, and [here](https://i.imgur.com/8ZFF0.png) is a typical cover letter that I send out. I feel like I should be getting more/hearing back sooner from these companies considering I have a Masters in the field and relevant experience.\n\nAny insight?\n\nEdit: The format for the cover letter is slightly off. It looks better as a pdf, though to get it into .png I had to copy it over to publisher and then save it, so the formatting is slightly better on those that I submit as my applications.",

Your comments made me hopeful, angry, frustrated, and joyous, but most of all, they made me think and re-evaluate everything I've done so far. I realize now that I was at once a bit overzealous in the positions I applied for and a bit lazy when it comes to representing myself well. I have a plan to improve my resume with specificity and projects and I identified a few areas that might be better suited for me.\nThank you redditors for all your constructive feedback! You have no idea how much it means to me!\n\n\nHi Reddit! I'm turning to you in my hour of need and looking for harsh, cold honesty.\n\nI finished an accelerated Master's program in statistics in May and probably applied to 1,000+ jobs over the summer; changed my resume at least four times, including getting a professional re-write; reached out to tons of people through connections and got internal referrals.\n\nFrom all of this, I got three call-backs, with eventual rejections. So, at this point, I'm asking if I'm even employable in data analytics.\n\nI am a carreer-switcher, with background in law. My BA was in humanities. But I found myself constantly being put in charge of technical and analytical projects and ended up deciding that data science was a better career for me. \n\nMy Master's program was very intense and I did well. I now know R and Statistics quite well for data munging, analysis, and visualization. I self-taught myself SQL, Python, and now, Tableau. I have many good \"tidy datasets\" projects I showcase on my resume from school and I have exposure to extremely \"un-tidy\" text-based data and business data from my years in law. I have never been an analyst, but I make sure to show that the work I did was mostly analytical, including business analysis in Excel and querying data using legal database management tools.\n\nObviously, I have a non-traditional background for a data analyst, but with the amount of time I put in, I was hoping to get some interests by now. Recruiters and connections don't reply to me 90% of the time.\n\nI just want to know at this point, is this a lost cause? Should I give up and go back to law? I like data science and I can lead a project from data ingest to conclusion to get insights. I have a scientific mind that's just rotting away in an administrative role. So, it would suck to give up. But I have loans that are due and no health insurance and I need to get real. So, get real with me, reddit. Any advice, tips for open positions, and harsh realities are appreciated.",

            "selftext": "So, I've been noticing that a ton of the Data Science jobs out there usually require a Masters, but preferably Ph.D for the full-fledged Data Scientist title. \nBecause it's a very hot field, naturally various boot camps and MOOCs have popped up, all offering courses in DS / ML / AI...but you might ask yourself \"Will the courses teach me what I need, or do I really need to spend 5 - 9 years at some University?\"\n\nWell, here are my thoughts (FWIW, I have a Masters in Applied Physics - Machine Learning): \n\n**1.** Even though many of the techniques are fairly old, the Data Science field itself is pretty young. Because of this, not many (educational) institutes have been offering any official or streamlined program towards DS. Hence why so many applicants come from slightly-related fields, where the same techniques are applied. \n\nBecause of the above, many schools do not offer DS / ML / AI before Graduate School - and even then, you're just scratching the surface. You learn the bare basics, and won't really get to touch the cool or recent stuff before you start on a Ph. D \n\nThis, in effect, creates a very large pool of applicants that hold a Masters or Ph.D \n\n**2.** The field is expanding rapidly, and some techniques or research areas (Deep Learning, for example) are quite recent. Because of the pace, you really do want applicants that can \n\nA) Fluently read research papers \n\nB) Convert ideas from research papers into working code  \n\nC) Potentially own research\n\nBecause research papers are written by researchers, for researchers, they are also quite dense to read. In short, you need to know the language (at times advanced Math and Engineering), and you need to know it quite fluently. \n\nIf you're a Ph.D, it's a good indicator that you're excellent at that. Scientists read research papers / literature all day. \n\n**Notes** \n\nWith that said...DS / ML are hot buzzwords, and many companies deal with quite trivial problems. Many of these jobs can absolutely be done without problem, just by doing short-term self-study, and knowing a bit of this and a bit of that. There are many \"ABC\" study guides floating around here, listing up all the fundamentals. \n\nHowever, if you want to work as a scientist / researcher, and want be on the forefront of things / cutting edge, I would advise you to seek a higher education. Whichever way you slice it, you need rigorous experience. \n\nThe **TL;DR** \n\n- Not many Universities offer stand-alone DS / ML programs, and many of the DS / ML programs are part of a Masters Degree specialization, and then a Ph.D program / research group\n\n- Because of that, many applicants and candidates hold a Masters or Ph.D - So you get a kind of inflation in the Degree level. \n\n- Research in some areas move fast, so you need to have some researcher skills to keep up - like reading research literature quite seamlessly. Academic (or other) research background will help you at this. \n\n**End notes** \n\nI predict that in 10-15 years, there will be more undergrad \"specialized\" jobs in DS or ML, simply because more schools will be offering said undergrad programs. I know that schools all over are doing everything they can to open programs like that, because of the high demand from both industry and students. ",

I\u2019m very comfortable for data, research, and analysis as I\u2019ve always found those types of projects wherever I\u2019ve been.  Fast forward a few years and a few kids, I\u2019ve decided I\u2019m ready for the official change into Data, whatever that may be as the titles change daily it seems.  The ultimate goal is to be the f*n man that pulls mind-blowing value from data and saves the company millions.\n\nI\u2019ve read some books and taken a few classes on Udemy (SQL, Python, R, MS Access), and it\u2019s obvious I still have a long way to go before achieving strength in all areas.  Although I must say it\u2019s coming along nicely, and most of all I love the process.  This work is energizing.\n\nI\u2019m happy in my current role which is a mix of business analysis, process improvement, and reporting.  Recently I lost an opportunity to join a BI team, and now I\u2019m at a crossroads of deciding the appropriate steps to make this happen.  The rejection was brutal, and I\u2019ve digested it as well as I ever will.  My thoughts have led me to two likely conclusions: it wasn\u2019t meant to be for me in BI/Data at my current company and I need to carve out my own path that ultimately leads to kick-ass Data Analysis/Science albeit circumventing the BI route, or I polish up my skills and prepare to leave the company.  Everything is on the table, and I\u2019m prepared to dedicate my entire existence to this career.  It\u2019s unclear to me what has the most value, or what combination of skills/training/creds will best tee me up for this career.\n\nFrom my current position I struggle to prioritize the following:\n\n1.\t**Online classes out the ass (edX, Udemy, Coursera) and in what order?**  Data Science, BI, Python, R, SQL, UX, Machine Learning, or Visualization (Tableua or Power BI?)\n2.\t**Formal classes (this is tough, only have one go and we\u2019re talking big $/time commitment)** - MS in Statistics, or MS in any of the new Data Analytics programs OR Certificate in Data Analysis (would prefer just going for the master\u2019s instead)\n3.\t**Domain Knowledge / Other Certifications** - PMP, Six Sigma, SCRUM, AGILE, any of these worthwhile?\n\nPersonally I feel it's either going straight for the master's immediately, or pushing it off and knocking out as many MOOC classes and work projects as I can.  Then knock out the master's to kick it up to the next level.\n\nRisks\n\n1.\tTime: I\u2019m not ancient but I\u2019m no recent grad.  Mid-30s.  Having a strong gameplan is critical.\n2.\tMoney: I\u2019m able to purchase one master\u2019s program from a standard school, nothing crazy.\n\nWhat I\u2019d love from you is any guidance or perspective that will help me prioritize and attack the situation ahead of me.  I've seen the success on this board, and I want some of that action.  I know this field is rapidly evolving and technology will likely kill many tools and processes we use today.  I firmly believe even with loads of new tech in the pipeline its true value is realized when somebody with appropriate training and experience is piloting the mission.  Thanks!\n",

This all started in around May. The class was supposed to start August 15th. It got pushed back and was supposed to start September 25th. So this week I contact them, since they said they would contact me and never did; suddenly they are saying the class is getting pushed back a few months and they're changing the days of the class so that I can not even attend. This was the first I was hearing of any of this and no one even thought to notify me or discuss any of the changes with me. Needless to say I asked for my money back.\n\nSo now I'm back at square one. I have a research background (M.S. in marine science) and am very familiar with most advanced math and statistics. I'm just looking for any advice that anyone can give me on how to get into teaching myself the things necessary to get into data analysis since my original plan fell through. I did buy a series of O'reilly books and have been going through them. But I'd be really grateful if anyone could give me some advice; especially maybe anyone that has taught themselves.\n\nThank you in advance for any advice. ",

            "selftext": "A little bit of background... About 7 months ago I decided I needed a career change due to a number of reasons.  Working as a Mechanical Engineer was not fulfilling anymore and I started to hear more about Data Science and Machine Learning.  I've always had a passion for performing data analyses but never really considered it more than a responsibility of my various positions.  After looking more into the field of Data Science, I was immediately hooked and wanted to learn everything I could in this field.  \n\nI started with a subscription to Datacamp.com and worked my way through the Data Scientist Track with R path.  In addition, I took some courses on Coursera (Machine Learning with Andrew Ng) and EdX (Microsoft Professional Program for Data Science).  I exposed myself to some Kaggle competitions and went to a few local Data Science meetups.  These were great opportunities to network and speak with other Data Scientists/Analysts to see what they were working on and brush up on skills that would look great on my resume.  Ultimately, I focused on Python (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and seaborn), R, and SQL.  The above courses are great for getting your toes wet and introducing you to the basics.  Also, keep looking at r/datascience and reading of others success stories, they have some great roadmaps!\n\nWith my skill-set quickly growing, I began applying to jobs about 3 months ago.  Anyone who's been through the application process before will know that this is a painstakingly slow process so whatever you do, don't give up and keep applying!  I applied anywhere and everywhere that had a position that sounded interesting.  Most importantly, I was applying for positions I thought I could eventually do, not just the ones that I could do now.  All the while, still working on my skills through any free courses I could find.\n\nUp until about 3 weeks ago, I was getting very few responses to my applications with even less interviews.  Although discouraging, I didn't give up.  I have to throw a big thanks to my friends, and most particularly my roommates for keeping me going through this process.  The single biggest change through this process occurred after my roommate suggested I update my resume.  Not just the content, but the format and look too.  I reluctantly took this advice and spent a few hours crafting multiple revisions until I got something that I was happy with the result.\n\nAfter updating my resume and applying to a few new jobs, my responses skyrocketed, I couldn't believe it (I fully intend to create a time series of this whole process BTW).  I went from next to no interviews to multiple phone calls in a single day and multiple in-person interviews in a week.  Full disclosure, it takes more than a pretty resume to extend the interview process so obviously it helps to understand the content.  \n\nI quickly managed to talk my way into a few interviews and I now landed my first job offer with another two interviews finishing up shortly!  My biggest problem now is deciding what to do if I receive multiple offers but that is definitely a good problem to have.  I would have never thought I would be in this situation but it helps to know that it can happen to anyone so don't give up chasing your passions!\n\nI hope my story can serve as a little bit of inspiration to anyone else out there looking to make a career change, it's never too late!\n\nTL;DR\nBored of my current job, wanted a career change\nTook some online courses to learn Python, R, and SQL\nCreated pretty resume\nApplied to every job under the sun\nGot a job offer!",

I believe that this helped me to land a job offer recently. Link to the post is as follows: https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/6uelis/resume_critique_new_graduate_miscellaneous_career/\n\nIts important to note that is has been only 1 month since I started looking and I have received 3 different offers and am currently finishing the interview process for 3 more companies. This is also my first real job out of college (just graduated from UCLA)!\n\nSo an LA media advertising firm made me an offer recently for the position of Junior Business Intelligence Analyst after telling me I didn't have enough experience for their regular Business Intelligence Analyst position, and while I am grateful for the offer, it seems on the low end.\n\nThe responsibilities of the role are generally to use SAS and SQL to consolidate data, developing BI dashboards for clients, build machine learning models for forecasting models from time series, testing the effects of marketing campaigns, etc.\n\nThe requirements were that I have a degree in Mathematics, Statistics or another quantitative field from a 4-year university, extensive programming experience, particularly in R, Python, and SAS, SQL skills, time series experience, and experience implementing machine learning models particularly on time series. I had all of these requirements on my resume except for SAS experience.\n\nCompensation: 48,000/year (hourly with potential for overtime), average benefits (with 25% matching of up to 4% of 401k contributions)\n\nI only say I think this is low because another offer I received from an insurance company for an assistant underwriter with 48k compensation and similar benefits where the only requirement was that I received a bachelor's degree from a university. The recruiter for this insurance company skirted around this number and even admitted to me that she thought it was low for the skills and experience I bring to the table, at least compared to Silicon Valley. I ultimately decided to not consider the offer since I didn't want to be an insurance underwriter!\n\nQuestions:\n\n1. What is the best way to evaluate the offer?\n2. Do you think this offer is reasonable based on entry level positions in the field?\n3. I am going to graduate school in a year and naturally have not mentioned this to my employer. Do you think this type of work with this media advertising firm is beneficial before I return to school for a MS in Stats?\n4. I fully intend to negotiate with them. Money is fortunately not an immediate issue for me. I don't think what they will end up offering is enough to warrant me to not consider the potential of other opportunities I am currently pursuing or continuing to look for another month. Should I still negotiate even if I don't end up wanting to take the final offer?\n5. Continue to look?\n\nI don't want to look a gift horse in the mouth, and I apologize in advance for any naivete on my part. This is all just very new to me!\n\nThanks for all the help that you can provide me once more!",

It might not be a technical fact related directly to data science, but still a pretty interesting read. In a way it shows how the application of one of the basic concept in statistics needs critical thinking:\n\n\n\n*When the Air Force put Daniels to work measuring pilots, Daniels harbored a private conviction about averages that rejected almost a century of military design philosophy. As he sat in the Aero Medical Laboratory measuring hands, legs, waists, and foreheads, he kept asking himself the same question in his head: How many pilots really were average?*\n\n*He decided to find out. Using the size data he had gathered from 4,063 pilots, Daniels calculated the average of the ten physical dimensions believed to be most relevant for design, including height, chest circumference, and sleeve length. These formed the dimensions of the \u201caverage pilot,\u201d which Daniels generously defined as someone whose measurements were within the middle 30 percent of the range of values for each dimension. So, for example, even though the precise average height from the data was five foot nine, he defined the height of the \u201caverage pilot\u201d as ranging from five seven to five eleven.*\n\n*Next Daniels, compared each individual pilot, one by one, to the average pilot. Before he crunched his numbers, the consensus among his fellow air force researchers was that the vast majority of pilots would be within the average range on most dimensions. After all, these pilots had already been preselected because they appeared to be average sized. (If you were, say, six foot seven, you would never have been recruited in the first place.) The scientists also expected that a sizable number of pilots would be within the average range on all ten dimensions. But even Daniels was stunned when he tabulated the actual number.*\n\n\n**Zero.**\n\n\n*Out of 4,063 pilots, not a single airman fit within the average range on all ten dimensions. One pilot might have a longer-than-average arm length, but a shorter-than-average leg length. Another pilot might have a big chest but small hips. Even more astonishing, Daniels discovered that if you picked out just three of the ten dimensions of size\u2014say, neck circumference, thigh circumference, and wrist circumference\u2014less than 3.5 percent of pilots would be average sized on all three dimensions. Daniels\u2019s findings were clear and incontrovertible. There was no such thing as an average pilot. If you\u2019ve designed a cockpit to fit the average pilot, you\u2019ve actually designed it to fit no one.*\n\n",

            "selftext": "TL;DR: learned a buncha shit in 20 months with no prior anything-related experience, got job as data scientist\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nEdit: Seems like this was removed from r/learnprogramming. Trying to direct all the PMs to come here\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nFirst, I want to thank the entire reddit community because without this place I wouldn\u2019t have went down the rabbit hole that is self-learning, job searching, and negotiation. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nSecond, just to list out my background so people know where I started and how I got here: I graduated in 2013 with a bachelor\u2019s in civil engineering (useless in this case) and again in 2015 with a master\u2019s in operations research (much more useful, namewise at least) both from the same top school. The name of the school and the operations research degree opened up quite a few doors in the beginning of my (2-year) career, and definitely was a factor in getting an interview, but had nothing to do directly with what was needed for the Data Science job. This is because that offer was contingent on a programming skillset and specific data science problem-solving abilities, of which I had none right after graduation.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe most useful advice to keep in mind: keep trying, keep learning, don\u2019t be afraid to switch jobs when you\u2019re bored or it\u2019s not what you want, continuously look for new opportunities, and always negotiate. I went from a 47k job where I lasted only 4 months, to a 65k job where I lasted just under a year, to a 90k job where I stayed 10 months, to my new job at 115k. All in under 2 and a half years. Strap yourself in, this will be long!\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Step 1:**\n\n\nGet your first real job out of college, realize how much you loathe it, feel entitled because they\u2019re not paying you for your amazing theoretical prowess that isn\u2019t really useful, realize that you were meant to do much more cool shit, and convince yourself that you need a higher paying job.\n\n\nMy first job out of grad school lasted 4 months. It was an analyst title, which I thought was awesome because I had no idea what analysts do, but it was mostly bitchwork and data entry. The one upside was that my boss mentioned a pivot table once, and I googled it, so I finally learned what it was. But I still figured I was too smart for this shit so I looked for other jobs because I needed something to challenge me.\n\n\nCongrats, you now have the drive to get your ass to a better role!\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**Step 2:**\n\n\nI got into the adtech industry after my 4-month stint, they liked me because of that pivot table thing I learned to do /s. This is where the data science itch began, but I knew I wouldn\u2019t be satisfied in the long run. As pompous as it is to keep saying I was too smart for this shit, I was. I just needed the tools to show that.\n\n\nThe amount of data that lives in the industry is insane, and it\u2019s always good to mention how much data you\u2019ve worked with. This place is where you earn your SQL, Excel, and Tableau medals. You edit some dashboards, you pivot and slice data, you don\u2019t necessarily write your own complex queries from scratch but you know how they look like and know what joins do.\n\n\nBy no means was I going to do any advanced stuff at work so I needed to start doing it on my own if I wanted to grow. In my time at this job (after work but also during work. Use your down time wisely!), I took MIT\u2019s Intro to Comp Sci with Python, Edx\u2019s Analytics Edge, and Andrew Ng\u2019s Machine Learning. This set up the foundation but since they were all intro courses, I couldn\u2019t apply the knowledge. There were still a bunch of missing pieces.\n\n\nBut! At least I got started. Towards the end of my time there I found rmotr.com through reddit. I finished the advanced python programming course, which was incredibly difficult for me at the time because of the knowledge density and intensity. I highly recommend it if you want to learn more advanced python methodologies and applications, and also if you\u2019re leaning towards the development side.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**Step 3:**\n\n\nI left my last company of a few thousand people, where everything was essentially fully established, and moved to a smaller company of 100ish people. There was more opportunity to build and own projects here, and it\u2019s where I earned my dev, analytics, and machine learning medals. This is where classes will continue to aid in your learning, but where google and stackoverflow will help you actually BUILD cool shit. You will have thousands of questions the classes won\u2019t be able to answer, so your searching skills will greatly improve in this time.\n\n\nDuring my time here I completed Coursera UMichigan\u2019s Intro to Data Science with Python. I completed it relatively quickly and from what I recall, it wasn\u2019t too challenging. \n\n\nAfter that course, I stumbled on Udemy and completed Jose Portilla\u2019s Python for Data Science and Machine Learning bootcamp, which was a turning point from knowledge to application. This class is a must. It\u2019s how I learned to neatly organize my data frames, manipulate them very easily, and, thanks to google and stackoverflow, how to get all that data into csv and excel sheets so I can send them to people. It doesn\u2019t sound like much, but data organization and manipulation was the #1 worthwhile skill I learned. It\u2019s also where I learned to implement all machine learning algorithms using scikit-learn, and a bit of deep learning. There wasn\u2019t much theory behind it, which was perfectly fine, because I was going for 100% application.\n\n\nThis is also where I took advantage of the training reimbursement at work- I kept buying courses and it was free! During this time I also completed Stanford\u2019s Statistical Learning course on their Lagunita platform (good for knowledge base), the first three courses of Andrew Ng\u2019s Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera (it was a breeze because it was in python and I had a deep understanding of dataframes by this time, also very good for knowledge base and algorithm implementation from scratch), and another Udemy class from Jose Salvatierra called the Complete PostgreSQL and Python Developer Course- also a game changer. It was the first course I had on clean python code for software development. The way he thinks is outstanding and I highly recommend it.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**Step 4: Resume Building and Linkedin**\n\n\nThere are articles out there that can explain this a lot better than I can, but here were my steps to have my resume and Linkedin Ready:\n\n\n*Resume*\n\n\n1.\tKept the resume to one page, had it look more modern, sleek, and fresh (even had dark grey and blue colors) \n\n2.\tUnder my name, listed my email, number, github, and linkedin across the entire width of the page\n\n\n3.\tRecent work experience on top. Descriptions included what technology I used (python, impala, etc.) to do something (built multiple scrapers, python notebooks, automated reporting, etc.) and the effect (saved hours of manual work for account managers, increased revenue day over day by X, etc). This can be easily remembered by saying I used X to do Y with the Z results.\n\n\nNote: Not all of my descriptions had results. My last listed job on my resume only had the support work I did- I supported accounts totaling X revenue monthly, partook in meetings with clients, etc. Not every task has a quantifiable outcome but it\u2019s nice to throw some numbers in there when you can.\n\n\n4.\tI read in some places that no one would care about this, but I did it anyway, and listed all courses and bootcamps I had finished by that time, which was around 8. While I had some projects I had done at work I could speak to, I wanted them to know that I was really dedicated to learning everything I could about the field. And it worked!\n\n5.\tBelow that was my education- both degrees listed without GPAs\n\n\n6.\tAnd lastly, active interests. Maybe old-school corporations don\u2019t care for things like this, but for start-uppy tech companies that are in a growth stage, I figured they\u2019d like to see my what I do on the side. I\u2019ve been competitively dancing for almost a decade and weightlifting for more than that, so if being a dancing weightlifting engineering-background guy makes me seem more unique, I\u2019m going for it. Whatever makes you stick out!\n\n*Linkedin*\n\n1.\tProfessional-looking photo. Doesn\u2019t have to be professional, just professional-looking.\n\n2.\tFill out everything LinkedIn asks you to fill out so you can be an all-star and appear in more searches. The summary should include a shitload of keywords that relate to what you\u2019ve done and what you want to do. Automation, analytics, machine learning, python, SQL, noSQL, MS-SQL, throw all that shit in there.\n\n\n3.\tI only filled out the description for my most recent job because that\u2019s where I actually did cool shit. I put a lot more detail here in LinkedIn than I did on my resume. Then I listed the 3-4 jobs I had before that, no description\n\n4.\tPut all my certifications from the courses I took with links\n\n\n5.\tPut my education, obvs\n\n6.\tThe rest\u2026eh. Doesn\u2019t really matter.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**Step 5: Job Search**\n\n\nSo you have your nice and shiny resume ready, and your LinkedIn set to go. This is where the entirety of your hard work will be rewarded. How badly do you want this job?\n\n\nI stopped using indeed, monster, etc. a long while ago. \n\n\nThe single tool I used was and still is Glassdoor. Download a PDF copy of your resume to your phone or a cloud drive, search on Glassdoor ON THE DAILY. Keep saved searches ready to go- \u201cjunior data scientist\u201d, \u201cdata scientist\u201d, \u201csenior analytics\u201d, \u201csenior data analyst\u201d, \u201cjunior machine learning\u201d, \u201centry data science\u201d, and so on. When you\u2019re on the bus or laundromat or in bed late at night and can\u2019t sleep, look for openings. Filter by the rating you\u2019re willing to take on and apply like mad. I got dozens of applications done just from waiting at the laundromat. All the calls I had after were 100% from Glassdoor applications.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**Step 6: The initial call**\n\n\nI\u2019ve had 3 total initial calls from the probably 50 or so applications I sent over the summer (very few openings that didn\u2019t require 5+ years of java and machine learning product dev etc. etc. and largely distributed blah blah where I live).\n\n\nHere were most of the things I was asked:\n\n\n\u2022\tWhat tools I used at work \n\n\n\u2022\tHow have I made processes more efficient at work\n\n\n\u2022\tAnything I\u2019ve automated \n\n\n\u2022\tLargest amount of data I worked with and what was the project and result\n\n\n\u2022\tWhy the shift from the current job\n\n\n\u2022\tHow much I know about their company and how I\u2019d describe the company so someone else (do your research!)\n\n\nI had 100% success on my initial calls. Each time mentioned some sort of python, automated scripts (simply by using windows task scheduler and batch file- thanks to google search!), and a data manipulation project (highest I\u2019ve had is a few million rows), and I was good to go.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**Step 7: The data exercise**\n\n\nFrom those 3 initial calls, I had 2 exercises sent via email and one via Codility.\n\n\nThe first exercise was SQL and visualization heavy. I was given a SQLite database to work from and had to alter tables to feed into other tables to aggregate other metrics and so on. Once that was done, I had to use the resulting tables to do some visualizations and inference.\n\n\nDid I know how to do most of what they asked? Hell no. I had google and stackoverflow open for every little detail I didn\u2019t know how to do off the top of my head. The entire thing took about 20-25 hours spread across the week and even when I submitted it didn\u2019t feel complete. I couldn\u2019t afford not to put all my free time into this exercise.\n\n\nThe end result: the hiring manager and team was impressed with the code, but they didn\u2019t vibe with the presentation style of my jupyter notebook and it was very apparent that I lacked the domain knowledge required (this was for a health tech company, and I have no health anything experience). It actually prompted them to re-post with an altered job description requiring domain knowledge. Woo? Regardless, this served as a huge source of validation for me- these senior level members thought my code was good. \n\n\nThe second exercise was from the company I ultimately accepted. It was 3-4 hours in total to assess business intelligence skills (SQL and visualization). They liked it and I moved on to the in-person, which I\u2019ll go into in the next step.\n\n\nThe last exercise was codility- and while my code \u201cworked\u201d, there was likely some test cases I didn\u2019t account for. Either that or the company got irritated when I said I received an offer and if they could speed up the process. They didn\u2019t follow through.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**Step 8: The in-person interview**\n\n\nSo you got to this stage! Congrats!\n\n\nAnd you\u2019ll be interviewing with 3 VPs, 2 C-level execs, and 2 data scientists. Jesus fuck, you\u2019ve never met this many executives in your whole life.\n\n\nNo need to freak out. This simply validates your hard work. You\u2019ll be meeting with very important people for a very important job, and they think you might be good at it. \n\n\nEven if I hadn\u2019t made it past this, I tasted victory.\n\n\nI did something that may not be recommended by most people: I didn\u2019t prepare for questions they\u2019d ask me, but rather prepared for all the questions I\u2019d ask them. This did two things: I didn\u2019t obsess about what they\u2019d ask me so I was relaxed, and it gave me a lot of chances to show I knew my shit when I asked them a bunch of stuff. Besides, for a data science job, I figured they\u2019d ask questions about how I\u2019d solve some problems they currently have, as opposed to some common questions. And that\u2019s exactly what they did. Not something you can really prepare for the night before, since it\u2019s a way of thinking you\u2019d have to grasp through all the classes and projects and problems you solved at your current job.\n\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: I am not advocating ignoring prepping for questions. I did about 30-35 interviews, phone and in person, before my current job so I had a lot of learning experience. I already had a more natural-feeling response for most questions. And if you really were into your projects at your current job, you\u2019ll know what you did inside out, so it\u2019s easier to talk about it on the spot. But by all means, if you don\u2019t have much interview experience, prepare and practice!\n\n\nHere are my notes from after the interviews, including what was asked and how I answered, and what I asked:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**VP of Data Science**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2022\t*Notice any hiccup in your exercise?* I debated with him on the accuracy of a single statement in the exercise, assuring him that since I used a Hadoop-based query engine and they used AWS, my method worked every time I used it. I never checked whether he or I was right because afterwards I started thinking he was right and didn\u2019t want to feel like an idiot. But we moved on rather quickly.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2022\t*How would you implement typo detection?* I gave a convoluted response but put simply, some distance index between words. As in, how many changes would it take to get to the word we may want. He liked the answer because it\u2019s what he was thinking too.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2022\t*How\u2019s your style of explaining things to people?* Very logical step-by-step process with the goal of weaning people off needing me. I\u2019d explain it to them completely, then next time leave a few steps missing and ask if they\u2019d remember, then eventually just give them a step or two.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2022\t*What\u2019s something you want to be better at?* Being more personable when explaining technical terms to non-tech people\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThen I went crazy with a ton of questions about what projects they\u2019re working on, what\u2019s the first thing I\u2019d be working on, the challenges they have currently, how do they interact with the sales team, and so on.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**VP Tech**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2022\t*So, data! Tell me about it.* I told him that I love it, I\u2019m excited by it, and I wana get better at it.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2022\t*What as a process you made more efficient at work.* Created an automated process using a batch file to run python script via task scheduler. It scrapes an internal web tool and creates reporting that otherwise doesn\u2019t exist, which saves hours for the account managers weekly.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2022\t*So you aimed towards a process that would essentially take something that\u2019s not working too well, fix it, and productionalize it?* Why yes, yes indeed.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2022\t*So that kind of sounds like a software development mentality.* Absolutely, and eventually after I have a lot of exposure to the research side of data science I\u2019d like to get more into a machine learning engineering role to build everything out.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2022\t*Cool man!*\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHe probably liked that I wasn\u2019t purely analytics, but also built tools to solve problems not related to data science.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**COO, President** \n\n\n\u2022\t*What are areas do you think you need development in?* Being more on the business side of things, as I tend to like delving deep into my code to make things work I sometimes get delayed info of the overall business health.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2022\t*Do you have any entrepreneurial experience?* I said nope, to which he responded with \u201cNothing? Not even selling lemonade?\u201d. Then it jogged my memory of when I tried to sell yugioh and pokemon cards at the pool when I was young, with my binder of sheets with prices too high so no one would buy. He had a laugh and said it was a good answer because the simple experience in learning the prices were too high was a lesson.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2022\t*What are you looking for?* Something challenging, where I won\u2019t be just a SQL monkey (this term was thrown around by a lot of the team, so I kept repeating it and made references to who mentioned it to show that I\u2019m paying attention), where there will be big issues to solve across the company, and a place where I\u2019d be doing something meaningful. In this case, it was helping local businesses thrive, and I\u2019m all for that. I\u2019m coming from an adtech background, so the emphasis was very clear on the \u201cfinding meaning\u201d part.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2022\t*If that's the case, why this company?* I liked that they were VERY fast with their interview process. I told him that and that it shows a lot about the company and how much they care to get things done. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2022\t*What was your proudest moment?* Told him about the first time I built a tool that helped the business, which was at my current company. The year or so of effort learning python and databases and manipulating dataframes led to a really cool scraping project that now seems rather novice, but I couldn\u2019t contain my excitement when I accomplished it.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**Data Scientists**\n\n\nSit and chat. I asked them questions about how they like it there, what projects they worked on, etc. Very laid back.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**VP Marketing (first form)**\n\n\nThis was the one guy who really grilled me with problem solving questions. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2022\t*Why did google decide to build out their own browser?* This is where my background in adtech helped. I listed almost everything I could about user data, selling to advertisers, tracking users, etc. He thought those were good answers, but it wasn\u2019t what he was looking for. He asked me the next leading question.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2022\t*What was so good about chrome compared to IE?* I stumbled on this since I never could really compare it fully to internet explorer since I never used IE, I just knew people said it sucked. With some guidance I answered correctly: faster load times.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2022\t*And what does that mean?* I took a few seconds of thought and answered correctly, that google wants their search pages to load faster.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFrom there, he pulled some stats about google CPC and rates from another country and asked me how much would google make in capturing a certain percent of the internet explorer user market. My process was correct, but the multiplication was off in the end. A bit embarrassing, but at least I owned it and made some jokes about division by hand. Got the correct answer after.\n\n\nThat concluded the first in-person interview. Got called for another in-person and I was shitting myself because I thought maybe they didn\u2019t get enough information. I was much more nervous for this one, but once the interviews started I was calm and confident.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**CMO** \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2022\t*What are some of areas that you need development in?* Same as I said before- business side things.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2022\t*Why the short tenure in your old jobs (4 months, 12 months, 9 months)?* THIS is where you have to show yourself as the ever-growing, constant-learning, autodidact with insatiable appetite to learn. I told him I learn on my own outside of work, I apply that knowledge to build cool shit, and that I outgrow my positions very quickly so I needed something more challenging. I backed it up with the projects I completed.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2022\t*What'll be the biggest challenge you'll face here?* Data Science team structure- sprints, prioritizing the right projects, etc. Haven\u2019t experienced it before so I\u2019d have to learn how to operate within that structure.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2022\t*What would your current boss say about you?* I explained that I have sort of two bosses, one tech and one nontech. The tech one would say I can take an idea and run with it to build a tool. The nontech would say I\u2019m very helpful and available asap when he needs me.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2022\t*What would they say you need improvement on?* Nontech boss- business side of things. Tech boss- get more into the details of adtech, like which scripts are executed on the page, how it relates to different servers, etc.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2022\t*What would your last boss say about you?* Always learning on the job\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2022\t*What's one example of when you thought outside the box?* Gave example of how the data engineering team was backed up and couldn\u2019t ingest some third party data, so I used python to ingest the data 6-8 weeks before they could do it. I also explained that while the process was essentially the same (extract, transform, load) I thought outside the box by not relying on the team assigned with the task and figured out my own way to do it. He thought that was an excellent example.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2022\t*What was your proudest moment?* Same answer as before\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2022\t*Why the move?* Current company is pivoting, has been for 8 months but not much to show for it, a lot of senior leadership is exiting, not confident in the direction it\u2019s taking, so figured this would be a great time to make a change.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2022\t*How would you describe your old bosses?* Last job- was first a coworker that was promoted to my boss. She was very kind, figuring out how to manage, but never lost sight of being compassionate and fighting for her team. Wonderful overall. Current job- nontech boss is very hands off since he doesn\u2019t know the details of what I do, but gives good overall ideas. With tech boss, we work together constantly on data tasks or ideas for new tools to build. Very logical and unemotional at work, similar to me.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAfter, I asked about what success looks like in the role and what were the biggest challenges facing his department.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**VP Marketing (final form)**\n\n\nHere he was again! Back with more questions to grill me. I really liked the guy because he did his due diligence, and it was fun because the questions made my brain\u2019s gears go overdrive.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2022\t*How would you go about seeing if users ordering from more than one location is profitable?* I responded with a very convoluted explanation for A/B test, which he said was good, then asked how to do it without the ability to do A/B test using data we already have. Was able to eventually tell him something along the lines of a time series analysis involving control groups.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2022\t*Walk me through how you'll implement A/B test.* Told him the basics, but that I haven\u2019t done it in practice. Couldn\u2019t answer his question about how long it should run for so I told him straight up, and he was okay with it.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2022\t*How would you go about determining the optimal number of recommendations to show on the app for each geographical type?* Basic group-bys by geo and success rate for each number of recommendations shown.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2022\t*What is logistic regression?* At this point I had just finished one of Andrew Ng\u2019s deep learning course, where you code a logistic regression from scratch, so I did a little showboating here with how much I knew =D\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2022\t*Take me through the process of how you got into machine learning.* I told him basically what I\u2019ve described here- that I felt useless after my master\u2019s, needed to not be left behind in the machine learning revolution, went crazy from day one and here I am.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI asked him:\n\n\n\u2022\tWhat are the projects I'll work on in the first month?\n\n\n\u2022\tYou worked at other huge and established companies, so why here and what makes you come back everyday?\n\n\nAnd! I give you the absolute best question to ask:\n\n\n\u2022\t\u201cYou\u2019ve had the most opportunity to get to know me and my skillset. I\u2019d like to know if you had any reservations about my qualifications as a candidate so we can discuss and take care of any concerns.\u201d\n\n\nBoom! And just like that, I knew how impressed he was and that the only reservation was my short experience, but that I more than made up for it with my passion and drive. He almost didn\u2019t want to say my lack of experience was a concern and looked very hesitant, I guess in fear of having me being like \u201cpeace!\u201d\n\n\nAnd that was that!\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**Step 9: Wait forever and get paranoid**\n\n\nTitle says it all. It\u2019s hard to wait and wait especially when you felt like you did really well, and especially when the interviewing process took 3 weeks but the decision process takes another 3 weeks. My advice is simply keep applying to other places, don\u2019t take your foot off the pedal, and continue learning/building things. I managed to finish another 2 courses from the time of the first interview to the offer, and even built my own small personal website. Don\u2019t let up!\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**Step 10: Negotiate**\n\n\nI\u2019ll leave it to you to gather more advice on negotiating and how to go about it, but my general advice is to always negotiate. Whether the market value is higher than the offer (I\u2019m not a fan of this explanation but I\u2019ve never had to use it), or you suddenly feel that the responsibilities are worth more or, as in my case, you realize they don\u2019t offer benefits you thought would be offered, then NEGOTIATE. It can be by phone or email, just do it. It\u2019s uncomfortable, you\u2019ll question your decision every second of the day for what seems like forever, you think they\u2019ll rescind the offer and get someone cheaper. Just relax. It\u2019s business. It\u2019s part of showing your skills by not leaving money on the table. With a role as specialized as this where there is a lot of demand, you have the upper hand if you\u2019ve already proved yourself. I got a nice bump at my current job and at the new data science job by asking for more. I\u2019ll leave you this fantastic link that helped with a changing mindset:\n\n\nhttp://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd that\u2019s a wrap! A quick summary of the most important lessons I learned in this journey:\n\n\n-\tYou don\u2019t have to get an expensive Data Science degree or go to an expensive bootcamp. Everything is literally available for free somewhere online, and more structured resources are available at very low cost (Udemy and their $10 specials!)\n\n\n-\tGlassdoor is the most important app in this process. Download it, keep a fresh copy of your resume on your phone, and send out apps during your commute, at the laundromat, while in bed on a lazy Saturday, etc. It\u2019s almost effortless\n\n\n-\tAbsorb everything you can. A lot of it won\u2019t stick, but a lot of it will.\n\n\n-\tLearning demands consistency. 10 hours of study spread across 2 weeks is much better than 10 hours you did that one weekend 2 weeks ago.\n\n\n-\tUSE what you learn somehow- if you picked up python, google how to scrape the web, or how to automate sending files via email, or how to connect to a certain database. Make a project out of it, even a mini-project that you can speak about later. Google will show you the way! Optimizing processes is sexy and it was the most frequently asked question in this job search. \n\n\n-\tIn case you couldn\u2019t tell, google and stackoverflow were lifesavers\n\n\n-\tTalk is cheap. A lot of people I know talk about taking classes and how excited they are. A year later they\u2019re in the same place. Learn it, use it, and continue learning. Spend less time talking about how you\u2019re gonna do something and work towards getting it done.\n\n\n-\tYou\u2019ll stumble through a lot of material- and that\u2019s okay. Not everything is connected in the beginning, and a lot of it will feel like wasted effort. Keep going! You\u2019ll reach the \u201caha!\u201d moment when everything clicks and you \u201cget it\u201d. It might take a year and a half, but think about what would have happened if you started a year and a half ago?\n\n\n-\tAdding to the last point, it\u2019s hard to know where to start and where to go. I\u2019ll summarize a cheap quick start guide for data science below if you\u2019re lost!\n\n\n-\tGet ready to make sacrifices. On average it was 3-4 hours daily, everyday, before or after work, and sometimes 6 hours on each of the weekend days. And this isn\u2019t counting the coding I did during work to make things more efficient, which is at least another 3-4 hours per workday. \n\n\n-\tI did take about 6-8 weeks off in total throughout the whole process though. You\u2019ll burn out sometimes, and that\u2019s okay! If you\u2019re as driven and passionate as I was, you\u2019ll come back to it weeks later, maybe even a month.\n\n\n-\tLastly, reddit is a place of vast knowledge of the field. Use it, go to r/learnprogramming or r/datascience or r/jobs or r/personalfinance. There will be questions and topics covering a lot of what I covered here.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**Quick start guide for data science:**\n\n\n(in no particular order)\n\n\n-\tIntroduction to Computer Science with Python from Edx.org\n\n\n-\tEither:\n\n\no\tAndrew Ng\u2019s Machine learning via coursera (not in python, but teaches you to know the matrix manipulation fundamentals)\n\n\no\tStatistical Learning via Stanford Lagunita (more theory than programming understanding, but covers similar concepts, and introduces R which is also a good tool)\n\n\n-\tPython Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp via Udemy\nAgain, this is just to get started. Google and stackoverflow will take you to the next level and other courses will fill the knowledge gaps. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nFull list of courses I\u2019ve completed:\n\n\u2022\tComplete Python Web Course from Udemy\n\n\u2022\tComplete Python and PostgreSQL Developer Course from Udemy\n\n\u2022\tDeeplearning.ai's Specialization from Coursera\n\n\u2022\tStatistical Learning from Stanford Lagunita\n\n\u2022\tPython for Data Science and Machine Learning from Udemy\n\n\u2022\tIntroduction to Data Science in Python from Coursera\n\n\u2022\tIntroduction to Computer Science and Programming using Python from Edx\n\n\u2022\tAnalytics Edge from Edx\n\n\u2022\tMachine Learning from Coursera\n\nThanks for reading! Wishing you the best in your data science journey. I hope it\u2019s as rewarding, exciting, and fruitful as it was for me.\n\n",

I have a data set with 12 feature variables (10 continuous and  two categorical -which are of interest but not relevant atm). I want to make no prior assumptions and cluster my 20k or so data points into distinct clusters and asses their in cluster variability and cluster to cluster distance (lets start with k means). However-I want to actually visually represent these suckers-and therefore want to do some PCA beforehand. But I'm a little concerned about how PCA will affect my decision boundaries and the variability between clusters and within them. So my questions are:\n\nHow common is it that you run pca before a k means cluster algorithm?\n\nWhat should i keep in mind regarding how pca changes cluster assignment (other than the obvious change of variables which can transform data points in some pretty wonky ways)?\n\nWhat does the extreme similiarity in the k means clustering and pca algorithms (have read they are almost equivalent up to some constraints) mean in the greater context of the problem?\n\nThanks!\n\ni cross posted on r/machinelearning as i wasnt sure which was the most appropriate place to go!",

You'll want to put the original data in some persistence layer where you can go back and reuse it (as source of truth) if your work elsewhere down the pipeline requires revision, and therefore your data needs reprocessing.\n\nIn your dream-setup, what technologies would you use? I'm talking about anything and everything you can think of from the database (influxDB, openTSDB, Druid, HBase?) to the languages you'd use (Julia, Python, R, Go?) and any of the libraries and frameworks you'd bake into your system to handle steps along the way. I imagine we'll be hearing from at least a few people about the wonderful ways in which things like AWS Lambdas can be helpful in a platform like this.\n\nI've found lots of interesting material that deals with these ideas, but much of it is academic research that doesn't take modern tools or technologies into account.

What should I be doing on my own to make sure I am qualified for a more advanced data scientist role in the future?\n\n\n2. Are any decent jobs in the this field that allow people to work remotely?

I completed Andrew Ng's course on ML and found it extremely interesting. I loved every bit of it. I was on coursera every day, and completed everything in that course. It was very cool to go on Kaggle, read some tutorial kernals, and just find myself noting what the provider should have done differently as per Prof. Ng's advice. I feel like I have a solid understanding of the fundamentals of some of the most basic and widely used ML algorithms today, and how to use them properly. \n\nI'd now like to contribute on Kaggle, but I really do not have the skills to do ML (or really any data science) in Python/R. Though I probably could mash up some code from some popular kernals, I really wouldn't know what I was doing, and so that would be pointless. I've discovered two courses (specializations) that focus [on deep learning](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning#pricing) / [general data science](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-python#pricing) using Python, that seem pretty good. At this point, I'd like to learn Python over R.\n\nHas anyone taken these courses? Does anyone have an opinion on what are some good ways to learn Python with data science? Sometimes I think I could be overcomplicating this, but I really don't think it's wise to jump into Kaggle, only to possibly burn myself out because I don't know Python. Perhaps someone has been in a similar situation and can help guide me? Again, I could just jump into the above two courses, but if anyone can help optimize my solution so that I start in a better direction, that would be huge! \n\nThanks you, everyone! As it stands, my game plan is to get on Kaggle, build up a portfolio, and use that to help me land a job in the ML realm. I've actually found some interesting jobs that combine both my collegiate background with ML. Pretty neat.\n\n",

Therefore, I can visualise how the data would need to be laid out to develop such a search engine, but lack the knowledge of what tools/code that would be required.  I've been researching NLP for the last few days, but don't think that's quite the same as what I'd be looking to implement.  I can hard code the few natural language terms required, rather than use advanced tools to predict what is being asked.

            "selftext": "**TL;DR: Looking for helpful feedback regarding my specific personal situation. Thanks!**\n\n\nHello, \n\nWarning in advance, this is a long post. Trying to be specific/detailed enough to get appropriate/relevant feedback. \n\nI have a B.B.A degree in Economics and I spent a year working in corporate finance at a Fortune 500 company doing internal financial planning and analysis on the expense side. I found this work to be incredibly dry and unfulfilling. I was an \"analyst\", but my work was very simple and didn't require much analytical thought or decision making of any kind. I'm currently traveling internationally and teaching English to sustain myself. During this time, I'd like to build my skill-set to set myself up for a more fulfilling job/career once I return to the U.S. and \"settle down\". \n\nI really loved studying economics in school and even considered a PhD in econ, but I do not think I am cut out for a PhD, and also one of the main things that turned me off from econ is how impractical it is and how theoretical it is. Many of the economic models we studied in school have a limited basis in reality and are not practical to the work force. \n\nI have currently become really interested in data in general and the contrast it has to econ in general in that it is extremely practical and useful for business. (Speaking in broad generalizations, because obviously some empirical econ work/econometrics can in fact be very practical, but anyone who has studied econ seriously knows that it is a field that is by and large overly theoretical and detached from reality. \n\nI have decided to start self-studying \"data science\" or \"data analytics\". I do not know the exact definitions of these terms and am using them very loosely, but I basically mean I am studying statistics, data analysis, python, r, sql, data visualization, etc. I do not have a background in coding or computer science, but have done some self study in coding. I am by no means very knowledgeable with algorithms or modeling. My math background is also quite limited. I have studied through Calculus 1. \n\nMy ultimate goal is to find a career that involves analysis/presentation of data in a way that is:\n\n1) Meaningful/useful \n\n2) Fulfilling/satisfying (My job crunching basic expense numbers and reporting them up the chain of command to operations managers or higher level finance people was mind numbingly boring and unsatisfying. \n\nI am aware that many \"data science\" positions involve a lot of tedious work such as compiling and cleaning data, but as long as it has an end result that requires some analytical thought and analysis and has some fulfilling end product such as a useful and eloquent visualization or chart (or once more experienced - useful predictive model) then I will ultimately be fulfilled I believe. \n\nI know that I am at a disadvantage by not having a hard stem background or an advanced degree. I am open to the possibility of a masters degree. I would probably try to aim for a stats, data science, analytics, or possible CS masters, although I probably do not have the required pre-reqs for most programs. I did have a strong undergrad GPA in Econ. \n\nAt the moment, my current plan is to self-study as much as possible and learn the basics that are valuable to an employer and could get me in the door in a data analytics type position. \n\nI am starting with a course called \"Data Science A-Z\" on Udemy based on this recommendation: https://medium.freecodecamp.org/i-ranked-all-the-best-data-science-intro-courses-based-on-thousands-of-data-points-db5dc7e3eb8e\n\nI am also re-working through a free intro to stats textbook to brush up on my statistics. Although it is all review since I took two Stats classes at University. \n\nI plan to learn some Python or R for data science next and begin to work on projects and keep tackling things such as SQL, linear algebra, brush up on calculus, etc, etc. \n\nHere are my questions for the people on this subreddit:\n\n1. Am I on the right track with my self-study plan? Any suggestions/feedback?\n\n2. How realistic is my ultimate goal/career plan? What are my possible end results based on my current educational background and self-study plan?\n\n3. Should I pursue a masters degree and if so what degree? (I'm very opposed to paying thousands or tens of thousands for a degree unless the ROI is worth it.)\n\n4. Will I forever be limited/relegated to basic data analytics positions with my non math/stats/CS formal background and no advanced degree? \n\nPlease do not be afraid to be harsh or blunt with your feedback. I'm looking for realistic/pragmatic answers and advice based on my specific background. \n\n**TL;DR: Looking for helpful feedback regarding my specific personal situation. Thanks!**\n\n\n",

I have a basic understanding of FFT, but I'm at a loss for how looking at the frequency domain is useful in analysis besides getting a list of time periods and amplitudes. Is this really it in the toolkit for Time Series analysis? Also, I took a class where we made lagged correllelograms, where we would take our signal in the time domain, lag it, then get the correllation and plot the correlation values as a function of lag.

These are fields I would like to transition towards, but I've been finding it difficult at the moment without the right profile. Today I got accepted into a data science bootcamp (roughly 3 months intensive) with an 85% scholarship because of a project I submitted. It was conceptual - my coding is basic at best, my math is decent. \nI'm currently unemployed, with some options on the horizon, so no major loss ito leaving a job to do this. Even only paying 15%, it's still expensive, plus living costs in a new city for 3 months.\nHas anyone had an experience with bootcamps? Is it worth the \"in-depth\" nature (as much as you can in 3 months), as opposed to learning the same thing part time?\nI know I can get the right profile for data work with some self-study projects. It's more about time and cost. Even online courses to make up a \"bootcamp\" seem to cost a similar amount when put together. I worry about the quality vs in-person checking and continuous project work.\n\nIn my thought and confusion I'm really just looking for a sounding board, opinion, and any experience from the field.",

            "selftext": "Hi everyone, \n\nI browse this subreddit quite a bit. Actually it is the first thing I do when I get to work in the morning. I see a lot of posts about data analyst positions and I thought I would share my current experience one month in. \n\nA little about myself: I graduated from a very good small liberal arts school not super well known for its science and math programs. But I graduated with a degree in physics and a minor in math. My math minor which included probability models, applied statistics in R, mathematical statistics (proofs of t-test and other things you never want to prove like the Rao-Blackwell theorem), and bayesian statistics with R. I chose work over grad-school because I was unsure exactly what field I wanted to go into and did not want to spend money on a degree that would not further my career. I think the biggest thing that set me apart when I was interviewing was my demonstration that I can learn on my own. Personal projects were something that interviewers were very curious about and I was happy to show them a web-scrapper I built or a website with MySQL developed in django. \n\nA little bit about my job: I work as a marketing analyst for a natural gas company trying to bring insight into different strategies and predict a variety of different things. This means I do all the sexy things like cleaning data, cleaning data, and cleaning data. I currently use python and R for a lot of my data manipulation. Our company actual uses PowerBI for visualization and reports and it is horribly slow, but very free. Coming out of undergrad I was excited to dive right into applied machine learning algorithms and tried to learn as much as I can about that. But, I think the most important thing is curiosity and wanting to learn about the actual business itself. It is impossible to be a good data analyst if you don't know why the data is being presented to you the way it is. In order to answer interesting questions, you first need to be able to ask them and that all starts with playing with the data and visualizations (EDA!!), not just throwing a random forest regression, SVM, or naive bayes algorithm from scikit-learn. \n\nOverall it has been a great experience. My math training has been the most useful to me so far, SQL skills have been slowly improving, and I have yet to use any bayesian tricks which I thought was the coolest thing I have every learned, except for solid state physics. \n \nPlease pm with questions, I am happy to share my resume. I just recently went through this process and would be happy to talk about my interview experience and all the times I had to fail in order to get the job I have today. Learn how to make reports and try to enjoy it because it is going to be a big part of being a data analyst. I am going to work on some data pipeline stuff using luigi in python, so I would love to hear if anybody has suggestions or things to watch out for, let me know!\n\nJust wanted to say thank you all on this subreddit. I never learned about training imbalanced classifiers in school and I was able to create and properly train my model thanks to y'all. ",

            "selftext": "Hello, my friends! As the title says, I am a historian who has stumbled upon a pretty much complete list of all Anglican people married/baptized in a city throughout the 19th century. \n\nThe problem is that the person who transcribed the information (manually, as most historian work is), transcribed it in a way that is really good for people to read, but bad to do analysis/visualizations.\n\nAny given entry on baptisms might look like this: \n\n\nDate of baptism | SURNAME, Name | Date of birth | Name of Father and Mother | Additional Comment (Usually origin of parents, but additional comments may exist)\u00a0\n---------------|-------------|-------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1819/10/03 | CAMERON, Elizabeth | 1816/12/27 | John/Elizabeth Cameron | Belfast/Ireland\n\n\nWhile marriages come organized as \n\nDate | SURNAME, Name of Groom | Origin of Groom | SURNAME, Name of bride | Origin of Bride\n----|----------------------|---------------|----------------------|---------------\n\nNow, even untrained me can catch that there is splittable data going on there and there is no explicit indication of a relationship between elements in order to create edges on a network graph. \n\nMy question to you guys is how could I clean/organize that data in order to make some proper analysis. While I am sure that with my sample size (about 900 marriages throughout the century and no more than 20 every year) I could not do heavy graph theory on it, but maybe I could do some cool visualizations in order to extract better conclusions from it. \n\nAt this point, my feeling from reading the source is that 1) over time, the british community had a high rate of loss of its members to the cultural (and religious) context of Brazilian society. I kinda see that because of the low number of children baptized that actually got married in the same place some years later. Obviously there might be some confounding factors such as emigration, but I would want to test it.\n\n2) There are familiar alliances between sections of the british society based up on engagement or not on the African Slave Trade. I can compare the names with the economical activity in other places, but currently I have no way to actually visualize if such alliances exist in a bigger scale.\n\nPS: I have access to Tableau, could dabble in R, the data is in Excel format.\n\nAny help would be very much welcome!",

Though I have been reading up on the profession, there are a few things about the field (in particular Big Data processing) that I am unclear about. What I would be curious about is setting it in an applied example that might take place at my workplace to really visualize how it works in practice, and perhaps to even help make a business case at my company.\n\nA big example at my workplace would be predicting churn across our subscription products. We have a great deal of clickstream and usage data that we gather through Adobe Analytics, standard marketing data, and specialized customer insight data that tell us about their interests. I imagine with this type of data we could tell a great deal about whether a customer will cancel in the coming year.\n\nWith that in mind, perhaps you could help me with the following questions:\n\n1. **Collecting data**\nWhat type of data beyond what I have already mentioned would be most useful for a churn model? What are the most common sources one draws from?\n\n2. **Data Processing**\nWhen are big data techniques (Spark etc) for a model such as I've mentioned appropriate? We do generate a fair amount of data - I am told the clickstream data generates a TB a day. However Adobe Analytics seems to alleviate the need to look into the raw data as it summarizes the data into the metrics you are looking for already. What is the level of expertise a Data Scientist would need with Big Data techniques? Would it be enough to draw data from the clusters, or would there be more required than that?\n\n3. **Data cleaning**\nWhat is the type of data wrangling that would be needed for a churn model? And how would one do feature engineering? There are a great deal of variables to choose from, and I imagine a lot of metrics might be correlated - how would one account for this?\n\n4. **Modeling**\nWhat are the most appropriate models for a churn analysis? Some products are bigger than others, so what models might be best for large datasets and what for smaller? What models perform better for rare outcomes (for example, if you were looking to predict rare upsell opportunities?)\n\n5. **Deployment**\nWhat is the level of proficiency a typical Data Scientist would have with platforms such as AWS? How we do it at our company is the data architect does all that work - is that a typical interaction for a Data Scientist, or would they typically be required to know more?\n\n6. **Maintenance**\nWe already maintain dashboards on a quarterly basis for senior management. I imagine an effort like this would follow the same process - ie. we would update our churn and other predictions every three months. Is this a trivial process, or is there a lot to think about here? Would this require to update the models constantly as new data becomes available? How is this possible - would you need a new training set?\n\nThankyou in advance for your help!",

            "selftext": "Hello all!\n\n\nI was hoping you guys/girls could give me some information on my best paths if I wanted to create a complicated simulation/model to handle some analysis and problems at work. I started the build in excel and notice some of my colleagues doubting the long-term capability of the model. I was considering writing it in VBA so that it could handle calculations that way without needing RAM to hold all the equations/information at once. However, I believe it would probably be better to build it in more specialized software.\n\n\n**What I want it to do sorted by priority:**\n\n-Create deep decision trees to handle different tasks.\n\n-Calculate a number of a metrics that would provide us information.\n\n-Dynamically (hopefully quickly) swap data sets out in order to see results for different projects.\n\n-Handle long-form logic of different natures.\n\n-Create visualizations of data, perhaps exportable.\n\n-Handle large amounts of information. (Millions of cells in excel, many of them equations. Equations are repeated a number of times, likely would only need one that iterates downward.)\n\n-A wide variety of modeling assumptions.\n\n-Be easy to use/view/derive information from! (For end users.)\n\n\n**Secondary/Long-term Objectives**\n\n--Switch Decision tree over to a neural-net/machine learning platform for better decisions.\n\n--Simulate a larger market with a number of inputs.\n\n--Monte Carlo type simulation. (I assume there's likely more advanced forms I don't know about.)\n\n\n**Bonus Objectives:**\n\n---Software that is affordable/free.\n\n\n\n**Additional Info:**\n\n----I know some programming. Not much, but I understand the type of logic and believe I solve problems in a fashion suitable to programming.\n\n----My job already has tableau. Not entirely sure what that handles but I know it's at least a visualization tool.\n\n\n\nI don't really know my options in software, nor what might be best to look for.  If I need to build a database in SQL or something perhaps I can do that. Any suggestions would be much appreciated!",

For example, I'd like to know the improvements in specific task completion times as a result of jumping from an older PC built around a Pentium D (with hardware like 2GB DDR2 memory, 5400rpm HDDs, etc.) to one built around a 7th-gen Core i5 (8GB DDR4, SATA SSDs, etc.). \n\nI personally understand that these increases are incredibly dramatic, but I need a way to quantify that in percentages so that I can explain it to the average person. I have access to test PCs of each type, and I can gather user statistics, I just need a workable method to gather the data I'm looking for.\n\nEssentially, I'm looking for a way to evaluate a specific program to see how it utilizes specific hardware. If I can get data such as Task X takes 6:32 (392 seconds) to complete on PC 1 and 3:46 (226 seconds) to complete on PC 2, that would be the perfect type of result. This way I can calculate, for example, that PC 2 offers an X% increase in productivity for Task X, and then I can calculate cost-per-hour savings for particular equipment setups, and make effective recommendations on hardware investments within my company. \n\nAlso, if anyone has any other recommendations that might be helpful in this pursuit, please feel free to share!\n\nThanks in advance,\nScrumpadoochousssss",

A customer could buy a certain product, but the likelyhood of him doing so could be extremely low.\n\nI thought away to get around this is by calculating expected value.  So, basically multiplying the opportunity by the probabilty of its occurence.\n\nso, my question is. how do i calculate the probability that a customer will buy a certain product that can then be used to create an expected value?\n\nwhat techniques?\n\nmy concern is that if product has low penetetration initally, the probability for all customers will turn out to be like 1% and then you will be creating too small of an opportunity number",

For example Wikipedia lists about 7 evaluation measures, I have no idea which is the best one, and if they are applicable to data derived from implicit feedback rather than the human guinea pig approach.\n\nThanks!",

            "selftext": "**About Me**\n\nI am currently a candidate for a MSc in Data Science. I started the program today and it is a two-year program.\n\nThis past summer I was hired as a Data Analyst Intern at a startup. Although I was not officially Data Scientist Intern, I did do some machine learning while on the job and implemented algorithms at various points. I don't think there is much difference between a Data Analyst Internship and a Data Scientist Internship **within a tech startup**. I do not know how data analyst interns operate in accounting firms, banks, etc.\n\n**The Interview**\n\nAfter a phone screening, I was invited to interview at the office. The first part was a behavioral interview with the Data Team Lead. The second part was a technical interview with the Data Scientist. \n\nQ1: Explain one of your projects on your resume to me as if I am a client.\n\nA: The best way to answer this question is to be as vague as possible. Clients/non-engineering members don't care about the algorithm you used or the results of the confusion matrix. What they do care about is how these results will affect their profits or their company in general. Don't talk about the decision tree implementation, talk about how the significant factors you found that led to the classification of the predicted value.\n\nQ2: Design a retail/book/grocery store relational database\n\nA2: Basically you want a table of all the transactions, the items and their prices, customers, each with keys that can join to the other table. I was also asked to limit the tables, join the tables, order a table and group by a table. We ran out of time, but the next part was CTEs.\n\n**The Internship**\n\nAs an intern I was asked to do a variety of things. However, my most used skill while at my internship was web-scraping. I developed scripts to scrape websites for a variety of information needed to make the company's current information more useful. If you do not know how to web scrape, I highly suggest you learn it. I personally use BeautifulSoup.\n\nThe data team was very small so I had the opportunity to work on all types of projects, including working with PDF and free text data. Therefore, I also learned how to work with unstructured data. This is a pretty daunting task and if you ever end up having to work with this form of data, I highly recommend keeping your bosses in the loop. I didn't and finished it with only a day to spare which was not ideal. \n\nI also worked with the data scientist to productionalize and augment the current models. While the data scientist worked on more pressing matters, I was testing different algorithms and examining outputs in forms such as confusion matrices, lift charts, AUC curves, etc. \n\n**Conclusion**\nOverall, I found this experience enjoyable. Although working at big 4 companies is ideal, I think working at start ups in big cities like New York, Boston, Silicon Valley, etc. is also super valuable. Being on a small team gave me some more responsibility than an intern would get and although none of the work I did was critical, it still provided value and left me in good terms with the employer.\n\nIf there was anything anyone else wanted to know that won't remove the anonymity of the company. Please ask. I saw some questions about people asking about data science internships an I wanted to give my two cents about my own \"data science\" internship. \n\n",

We had this idea because we felt that we lost too much time trying to find the right parameters, so we want to create a tool that makes you/us spend less time on parametrization and more time on the models and analysing the data.\nWe are still in the early stages of development, and we wanted to test the market and validate our idea. We would like to ask you to help us by answering a quick survey, that should take less than 5 minutes to fulfil. \nFeel free to give us feedback and ask whatever you want, I\u2019ll try to answer everything as soon as I can.\nLink to the survey [here](https://goo.gl/forms/CIgsBswAHUEl7LXE2)",

I have found it to be an amazing book, it has the exact level of detail and practicality that I require:  \n**a)** It manages to briefly visit the mathematics behind the ideas, giving you a stronger understanding of what is being described.  \n**b)** The above said, it doesn't get **too** deep into the mathematics or spend too long on any topics, which is great given that I work full time.  \n**c)** It has both conceptual exercises, exercises in R, as well as labs, making it a very practical book. Some books are so academic that after reading them, you then have the task of learning how to apply the knowledge through means of figuring it out yourself, or reading yet another book.  \n\nGiven these 3 criteria, does anyone have any recommendations for books of whose topics you would consider essential for a data scientist to know? Be it advanced machine learning, neural networks, data visualisation..  \nThanks",

            "selftext": "TL;DR: learned a buncha shit in 20 months with no prior anything-related experience, got job as data scientist\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nEdit: Seems like this was removed from r/learnprogramming. Trying to direct all the PMs to come here\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nFirst, I want to thank the entire reddit community because without this place I wouldn\u2019t have went down the rabbit hole that is self-learning, job searching, and negotiation. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nSecond, just to list out my background so people know where I started and how I got here: I graduated in 2013 with a bachelor\u2019s in civil engineering (useless in this case) and again in 2015 with a master\u2019s in operations research (much more useful, namewise at least) both from the same top school. The name of the school and the operations research degree opened up quite a few doors in the beginning of my (2-year) career, and definitely was a factor in getting an interview, but had nothing to do directly with what was needed for the Data Science job. This is because that offer was contingent on a programming skillset and specific data science problem-solving abilities, of which I had none right after graduation.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe most useful advice to keep in mind: keep trying, keep learning, don\u2019t be afraid to switch jobs when you\u2019re bored or it\u2019s not what you want, continuously look for new opportunities, and always negotiate. I went from a 47k job where I lasted only 4 months, to a 65k job where I lasted just under a year, to a 90k job where I stayed 10 months, to my new job at 115k. All in under 2 and a half years. Strap yourself in, this will be long!\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Step 1:**\n\n\nGet your first real job out of college, realize how much you loathe it, feel entitled because they\u2019re not paying you for your amazing theoretical prowess that isn\u2019t really useful, realize that you were meant to do much more cool shit, and convince yourself that you need a higher paying job.\n\n\nMy first job out of grad school lasted 4 months. It was an analyst title, which I thought was awesome because I had no idea what analysts do, but it was mostly bitchwork and data entry. The one upside was that my boss mentioned a pivot table once, and I googled it, so I finally learned what it was. But I still figured I was too smart for this shit so I looked for other jobs because I needed something to challenge me.\n\n\nCongrats, you now have the drive to get your ass to a better role!\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**Step 2:**\n\n\nI got into the adtech industry after my 4-month stint, they liked me because of that pivot table thing I learned to do /s. This is where the data science itch began, but I knew I wouldn\u2019t be satisfied in the long run. As pompous as it is to keep saying I was too smart for this shit, I was. I just needed the tools to show that.\n\n\nThe amount of data that lives in the industry is insane, and it\u2019s always good to mention how much data you\u2019ve worked with. This place is where you earn your SQL, Excel, and Tableau medals. You edit some dashboards, you pivot and slice data, you don\u2019t necessarily write your own complex queries from scratch but you know how they look like and know what joins do.\n\n\nBy no means was I going to do any advanced stuff at work so I needed to start doing it on my own if I wanted to grow. In my time at this job (after work but also during work. Use your down time wisely!), I took MIT\u2019s Intro to Comp Sci with Python, Edx\u2019s Analytics Edge, and Andrew Ng\u2019s Machine Learning. This set up the foundation but since they were all intro courses, I couldn\u2019t apply the knowledge. There were still a bunch of missing pieces.\n\n\nBut! At least I got started. Towards the end of my time there I found rmotr.com through reddit. I finished the advanced python programming course, which was incredibly difficult for me at the time because of the knowledge density and intensity. I highly recommend it if you want to learn more advanced python methodologies and applications, and also if you\u2019re leaning towards the development side.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**Step 3:**\n\n\nI left my last company of a few thousand people, where everything was essentially fully established, and moved to a smaller company of 100ish people. There was more opportunity to build and own projects here, and it\u2019s where I earned my dev, analytics, and machine learning medals. This is where classes will continue to aid in your learning, but where google and stackoverflow will help you actually BUILD cool shit. You will have thousands of questions the classes won\u2019t be able to answer, so your searching skills will greatly improve in this time.\n\n\nDuring my time here I completed Coursera UMichigan\u2019s Intro to Data Science with Python. I completed it relatively quickly and from what I recall, it wasn\u2019t too challenging. \n\n\nAfter that course, I stumbled on Udemy and completed Jose Portilla\u2019s Python for Data Science and Machine Learning bootcamp, which was a turning point from knowledge to application. This class is a must. It\u2019s how I learned to neatly organize my data frames, manipulate them very easily, and, thanks to google and stackoverflow, how to get all that data into csv and excel sheets so I can send them to people. It doesn\u2019t sound like much, but data organization and manipulation was the #1 worthwhile skill I learned. It\u2019s also where I learned to implement all machine learning algorithms using scikit-learn, and a bit of deep learning. There wasn\u2019t much theory behind it, which was perfectly fine, because I was going for 100% application.\n\n\nThis is also where I took advantage of the training reimbursement at work- I kept buying courses and it was free! During this time I also completed Stanford\u2019s Statistical Learning course on their Lagunita platform (good for knowledge base), the first three courses of Andrew Ng\u2019s Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera (it was a breeze because it was in python and I had a deep understanding of dataframes by this time, also very good for knowledge base and algorithm implementation from scratch), and another Udemy class from Jose Salvatierra called the Complete PostgreSQL and Python Developer Course- also a game changer. It was the first course I had on clean python code for software development. The way he thinks is outstanding and I highly recommend it.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**Step 4: Resume Building and Linkedin**\n\n\nThere are articles out there that can explain this a lot better than I can, but here were my steps to have my resume and Linkedin Ready:\n\n\n*Resume*\n\n\n1.\tKept the resume to one page, had it look more modern, sleek, and fresh (even had dark grey and blue colors) \n\n2.\tUnder my name, listed my email, number, github, and linkedin across the entire width of the page\n\n\n3.\tRecent work experience on top. Descriptions included what technology I used (python, impala, etc.) to do something (built multiple scrapers, python notebooks, automated reporting, etc.) and the effect (saved hours of manual work for account managers, increased revenue day over day by X, etc). This can be easily remembered by saying I used X to do Y with the Z results.\n\n\nNote: Not all of my descriptions had results. My last listed job on my resume only had the support work I did- I supported accounts totaling X revenue monthly, partook in meetings with clients, etc. Not every task has a quantifiable outcome but it\u2019s nice to throw some numbers in there when you can.\n\n\n4.\tI read in some places that no one would care about this, but I did it anyway, and listed all courses and bootcamps I had finished by that time, which was around 8. While I had some projects I had done at work I could speak to, I wanted them to know that I was really dedicated to learning everything I could about the field. And it worked!\n\n5.\tBelow that was my education- both degrees listed without GPAs\n\n\n6.\tAnd lastly, active interests. Maybe old-school corporations don\u2019t care for things like this, but for start-uppy tech companies that are in a growth stage, I figured they\u2019d like to see my what I do on the side. I\u2019ve been competitively dancing for almost a decade and weightlifting for more than that, so if being a dancing weightlifting engineering-background guy makes me seem more unique, I\u2019m going for it. Whatever makes you stick out!\n\n*Linkedin*\n\n1.\tProfessional-looking photo. Doesn\u2019t have to be professional, just professional-looking.\n\n2.\tFill out everything LinkedIn asks you to fill out so you can be an all-star and appear in more searches. The summary should include a shitload of keywords that relate to what you\u2019ve done and what you want to do. Automation, analytics, machine learning, python, SQL, noSQL, MS-SQL, throw all that shit in there.\n\n\n3.\tI only filled out the description for my most recent job because that\u2019s where I actually did cool shit. I put a lot more detail here in LinkedIn than I did on my resume. Then I listed the 3-4 jobs I had before that, no description\n\n4.\tPut all my certifications from the courses I took with links\n\n\n5.\tPut my education, obvs\n\n6.\tThe rest\u2026eh. Doesn\u2019t really matter.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**Step 5: Job Search**\n\n\nSo you have your nice and shiny resume ready, and your LinkedIn set to go. This is where the entirety of your hard work will be rewarded. How badly do you want this job?\n\n\nI stopped using indeed, monster, etc. a long while ago. \n\n\nThe single tool I used was and still is Glassdoor. Download a PDF copy of your resume to your phone or a cloud drive, search on Glassdoor ON THE DAILY. Keep saved searches ready to go- \u201cjunior data scientist\u201d, \u201cdata scientist\u201d, \u201csenior analytics\u201d, \u201csenior data analyst\u201d, \u201cjunior machine learning\u201d, \u201centry data science\u201d, and so on. When you\u2019re on the bus or laundromat or in bed late at night and can\u2019t sleep, look for openings. Filter by the rating you\u2019re willing to take on and apply like mad. I got dozens of applications done just from waiting at the laundromat. All the calls I had after were 100% from Glassdoor applications.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**Step 6: The initial call**\n\n\nI\u2019ve had 3 total initial calls from the probably 50 or so applications I sent over the summer (very few openings that didn\u2019t require 5+ years of java and machine learning product dev etc. etc. and largely distributed blah blah where I live).\n\n\nHere were most of the things I was asked:\n\n\n\u2022\tWhat tools I used at work \n\n\n\u2022\tHow have I made processes more efficient at work\n\n\n\u2022\tAnything I\u2019ve automated \n\n\n\u2022\tLargest amount of data I worked with and what was the project and result\n\n\n\u2022\tWhy the shift from the current job\n\n\n\u2022\tHow much I know about their company and how I\u2019d describe the company so someone else (do your research!)\n\n\nI had 100% success on my initial calls. Each time mentioned some sort of python, automated scripts (simply by using windows task scheduler and batch file- thanks to google search!), and a data manipulation project (highest I\u2019ve had is a few million rows), and I was good to go.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**Step 7: The data exercise**\n\n\nFrom those 3 initial calls, I had 2 exercises sent via email and one via Codility.\n\n\nThe first exercise was SQL and visualization heavy. I was given a SQLite database to work from and had to alter tables to feed into other tables to aggregate other metrics and so on. Once that was done, I had to use the resulting tables to do some visualizations and inference.\n\n\nDid I know how to do most of what they asked? Hell no. I had google and stackoverflow open for every little detail I didn\u2019t know how to do off the top of my head. The entire thing took about 20-25 hours spread across the week and even when I submitted it didn\u2019t feel complete. I couldn\u2019t afford not to put all my free time into this exercise.\n\n\nThe end result: the hiring manager and team was impressed with the code, but they didn\u2019t vibe with the presentation style of my jupyter notebook and it was very apparent that I lacked the domain knowledge required (this was for a health tech company, and I have no health anything experience). It actually prompted them to re-post with an altered job description requiring domain knowledge. Woo? Regardless, this served as a huge source of validation for me- these senior level members thought my code was good. \n\n\nThe second exercise was from the company I ultimately accepted. It was 3-4 hours in total to assess business intelligence skills (SQL and visualization). They liked it and I moved on to the in-person, which I\u2019ll go into in the next step.\n\n\nThe last exercise was codility- and while my code \u201cworked\u201d, there was likely some test cases I didn\u2019t account for. Either that or the company got irritated when I said I received an offer and if they could speed up the process. They didn\u2019t follow through.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**Step 8: The in-person interview**\n\n\nSo you got to this stage! Congrats!\n\n\nAnd you\u2019ll be interviewing with 3 VPs, 2 C-level execs, and 2 data scientists. Jesus fuck, you\u2019ve never met this many executives in your whole life.\n\n\nNo need to freak out. This simply validates your hard work. You\u2019ll be meeting with very important people for a very important job, and they think you might be good at it. \n\n\nEven if I hadn\u2019t made it past this, I tasted victory.\n\n\nI did something that may not be recommended by most people: I didn\u2019t prepare for questions they\u2019d ask me, but rather prepared for all the questions I\u2019d ask them. This did two things: I didn\u2019t obsess about what they\u2019d ask me so I was relaxed, and it gave me a lot of chances to show I knew my shit when I asked them a bunch of stuff. Besides, for a data science job, I figured they\u2019d ask questions about how I\u2019d solve some problems they currently have, as opposed to some common questions. And that\u2019s exactly what they did. Not something you can really prepare for the night before, since it\u2019s a way of thinking you\u2019d have to grasp through all the classes and projects and problems you solved at your current job.\n\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: I am not advocating ignoring prepping for questions. I did about 30-35 interviews, phone and in person, before my current job so I had a lot of learning experience. I already had a more natural-feeling response for most questions. And if you really were into your projects at your current job, you\u2019ll know what you did inside out, so it\u2019s easier to talk about it on the spot. But by all means, if you don\u2019t have much interview experience, prepare and practice!\n\n\nHere are my notes from after the interviews, including what was asked and how I answered, and what I asked:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**VP of Data Science**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2022\t*Notice any hiccup in your exercise?* I debated with him on the accuracy of a single statement in the exercise, assuring him that since I used a Hadoop-based query engine and they used AWS, my method worked every time I used it. I never checked whether he or I was right because afterwards I started thinking he was right and didn\u2019t want to feel like an idiot. But we moved on rather quickly.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2022\t*How would you implement typo detection?* I gave a convoluted response but put simply, some distance index between words. As in, how many changes would it take to get to the word we may want. He liked the answer because it\u2019s what he was thinking too.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2022\t*How\u2019s your style of explaining things to people?* Very logical step-by-step process with the goal of weaning people off needing me. I\u2019d explain it to them completely, then next time leave a few steps missing and ask if they\u2019d remember, then eventually just give them a step or two.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2022\t*What\u2019s something you want to be better at?* Being more personable when explaining technical terms to non-tech people\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThen I went crazy with a ton of questions about what projects they\u2019re working on, what\u2019s the first thing I\u2019d be working on, the challenges they have currently, how do they interact with the sales team, and so on.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**VP Tech**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2022\t*So, data! Tell me about it.* I told him that I love it, I\u2019m excited by it, and I wana get better at it.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2022\t*What as a process you made more efficient at work.* Created an automated process using a batch file to run python script via task scheduler. It scrapes an internal web tool and creates reporting that otherwise doesn\u2019t exist, which saves hours for the account managers weekly.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2022\t*So you aimed towards a process that would essentially take something that\u2019s not working too well, fix it, and productionalize it?* Why yes, yes indeed.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2022\t*So that kind of sounds like a software development mentality.* Absolutely, and eventually after I have a lot of exposure to the research side of data science I\u2019d like to get more into a machine learning engineering role to build everything out.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2022\t*Cool man!*\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHe probably liked that I wasn\u2019t purely analytics, but also built tools to solve problems not related to data science.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**COO, President** \n\n\n\u2022\t*What are areas do you think you need development in?* Being more on the business side of things, as I tend to like delving deep into my code to make things work I sometimes get delayed info of the overall business health.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2022\t*Do you have any entrepreneurial experience?* I said nope, to which he responded with \u201cNothing? Not even selling lemonade?\u201d. Then it jogged my memory of when I tried to sell yugioh and pokemon cards at the pool when I was young, with my binder of sheets with prices too high so no one would buy. He had a laugh and said it was a good answer because the simple experience in learning the prices were too high was a lesson.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2022\t*What are you looking for?* Something challenging, where I won\u2019t be just a SQL monkey (this term was thrown around by a lot of the team, so I kept repeating it and made references to who mentioned it to show that I\u2019m paying attention), where there will be big issues to solve across the company, and a place where I\u2019d be doing something meaningful. In this case, it was helping local businesses thrive, and I\u2019m all for that. I\u2019m coming from an adtech background, so the emphasis was very clear on the \u201cfinding meaning\u201d part.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2022\t*If that's the case, why this company?* I liked that they were VERY fast with their interview process. I told him that and that it shows a lot about the company and how much they care to get things done. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2022\t*What was your proudest moment?* Told him about the first time I built a tool that helped the business, which was at my current company. The year or so of effort learning python and databases and manipulating dataframes led to a really cool scraping project that now seems rather novice, but I couldn\u2019t contain my excitement when I accomplished it.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**Data Scientists**\n\n\nSit and chat. I asked them questions about how they like it there, what projects they worked on, etc. Very laid back.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**VP Marketing (first form)**\n\n\nThis was the one guy who really grilled me with problem solving questions. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2022\t*Why did google decide to build out their own browser?* This is where my background in adtech helped. I listed almost everything I could about user data, selling to advertisers, tracking users, etc. He thought those were good answers, but it wasn\u2019t what he was looking for. He asked me the next leading question.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2022\t*What was so good about chrome compared to IE?* I stumbled on this since I never could really compare it fully to internet explorer since I never used IE, I just knew people said it sucked. With some guidance I answered correctly: faster load times.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2022\t*And what does that mean?* I took a few seconds of thought and answered correctly, that google wants their search pages to load faster.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFrom there, he pulled some stats about google CPC and rates from another country and asked me how much would google make in capturing a certain percent of the internet explorer user market. My process was correct, but the multiplication was off in the end. A bit embarrassing, but at least I owned it and made some jokes about division by hand. Got the correct answer after.\n\n\nThat concluded the first in-person interview. Got called for another in-person and I was shitting myself because I thought maybe they didn\u2019t get enough information. I was much more nervous for this one, but once the interviews started I was calm and confident.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**CMO** \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2022\t*What are some of areas that you need development in?* Same as I said before- business side things.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2022\t*Why the short tenure in your old jobs (4 months, 12 months, 9 months)?* THIS is where you have to show yourself as the ever-growing, constant-learning, autodidact with insatiable appetite to learn. I told him I learn on my own outside of work, I apply that knowledge to build cool shit, and that I outgrow my positions very quickly so I needed something more challenging. I backed it up with the projects I completed.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2022\t*What'll be the biggest challenge you'll face here?* Data Science team structure- sprints, prioritizing the right projects, etc. Haven\u2019t experienced it before so I\u2019d have to learn how to operate within that structure.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2022\t*What would your current boss say about you?* I explained that I have sort of two bosses, one tech and one nontech. The tech one would say I can take an idea and run with it to build a tool. The nontech would say I\u2019m very helpful and available asap when he needs me.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2022\t*What would they say you need improvement on?* Nontech boss- business side of things. Tech boss- get more into the details of adtech, like which scripts are executed on the page, how it relates to different servers, etc.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2022\t*What would your last boss say about you?* Always learning on the job\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2022\t*What's one example of when you thought outside the box?* Gave example of how the data engineering team was backed up and couldn\u2019t ingest some third party data, so I used python to ingest the data 6-8 weeks before they could do it. I also explained that while the process was essentially the same (extract, transform, load) I thought outside the box by not relying on the team assigned with the task and figured out my own way to do it. He thought that was an excellent example.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2022\t*What was your proudest moment?* Same answer as before\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2022\t*Why the move?* Current company is pivoting, has been for 8 months but not much to show for it, a lot of senior leadership is exiting, not confident in the direction it\u2019s taking, so figured this would be a great time to make a change.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2022\t*How would you describe your old bosses?* Last job- was first a coworker that was promoted to my boss. She was very kind, figuring out how to manage, but never lost sight of being compassionate and fighting for her team. Wonderful overall. Current job- nontech boss is very hands off since he doesn\u2019t know the details of what I do, but gives good overall ideas. With tech boss, we work together constantly on data tasks or ideas for new tools to build. Very logical and unemotional at work, similar to me.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAfter, I asked about what success looks like in the role and what were the biggest challenges facing his department.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**VP Marketing (final form)**\n\n\nHere he was again! Back with more questions to grill me. I really liked the guy because he did his due diligence, and it was fun because the questions made my brain\u2019s gears go overdrive.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2022\t*How would you go about seeing if users ordering from more than one location is profitable?* I responded with a very convoluted explanation for A/B test, which he said was good, then asked how to do it without the ability to do A/B test using data we already have. Was able to eventually tell him something along the lines of a time series analysis involving control groups.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2022\t*Walk me through how you'll implement A/B test.* Told him the basics, but that I haven\u2019t done it in practice. Couldn\u2019t answer his question about how long it should run for so I told him straight up, and he was okay with it.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2022\t*How would you go about determining the optimal number of recommendations to show on the app for each geographical type?* Basic group-bys by geo and success rate for each number of recommendations shown.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2022\t*What is logistic regression?* At this point I had just finished one of Andrew Ng\u2019s deep learning course, where you code a logistic regression from scratch, so I did a little showboating here with how much I knew =D\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2022\t*Take me through the process of how you got into machine learning.* I told him basically what I\u2019ve described here- that I felt useless after my master\u2019s, needed to not be left behind in the machine learning revolution, went crazy from day one and here I am.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI asked him:\n\n\n\u2022\tWhat are the projects I'll work on in the first month?\n\n\n\u2022\tYou worked at other huge and established companies, so why here and what makes you come back everyday?\n\n\nAnd! I give you the absolute best question to ask:\n\n\n\u2022\t\u201cYou\u2019ve had the most opportunity to get to know me and my skillset. I\u2019d like to know if you had any reservations about my qualifications as a candidate so we can discuss and take care of any concerns.\u201d\n\n\nBoom! And just like that, I knew how impressed he was and that the only reservation was my short experience, but that I more than made up for it with my passion and drive. He almost didn\u2019t want to say my lack of experience was a concern and looked very hesitant, I guess in fear of having me being like \u201cpeace!\u201d\n\n\nAnd that was that!\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**Step 9: Wait forever and get paranoid**\n\n\nTitle says it all. It\u2019s hard to wait and wait especially when you felt like you did really well, and especially when the interviewing process took 3 weeks but the decision process takes another 3 weeks. My advice is simply keep applying to other places, don\u2019t take your foot off the pedal, and continue learning/building things. I managed to finish another 2 courses from the time of the first interview to the offer, and even built my own small personal website. Don\u2019t let up!\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**Step 10: Negotiate**\n\n\nI\u2019ll leave it to you to gather more advice on negotiating and how to go about it, but my general advice is to always negotiate. Whether the market value is higher than the offer (I\u2019m not a fan of this explanation but I\u2019ve never had to use it), or you suddenly feel that the responsibilities are worth more or, as in my case, you realize they don\u2019t offer benefits you thought would be offered, then NEGOTIATE. It can be by phone or email, just do it. It\u2019s uncomfortable, you\u2019ll question your decision every second of the day for what seems like forever, you think they\u2019ll rescind the offer and get someone cheaper. Just relax. It\u2019s business. It\u2019s part of showing your skills by not leaving money on the table. With a role as specialized as this where there is a lot of demand, you have the upper hand if you\u2019ve already proved yourself. I got a nice bump at my current job and at the new data science job by asking for more. I\u2019ll leave you this fantastic link that helped with a changing mindset:\n\n\nhttp://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd that\u2019s a wrap! A quick summary of the most important lessons I learned in this journey:\n\n\n-\tYou don\u2019t have to get an expensive Data Science degree or go to an expensive bootcamp. Everything is literally available for free somewhere online, and more structured resources are available at very low cost (Udemy and their $10 specials!)\n\n\n-\tGlassdoor is the most important app in this process. Download it, keep a fresh copy of your resume on your phone, and send out apps during your commute, at the laundromat, while in bed on a lazy Saturday, etc. It\u2019s almost effortless\n\n\n-\tAbsorb everything you can. A lot of it won\u2019t stick, but a lot of it will.\n\n\n-\tLearning demands consistency. 10 hours of study spread across 2 weeks is much better than 10 hours you did that one weekend 2 weeks ago.\n\n\n-\tUSE what you learn somehow- if you picked up python, google how to scrape the web, or how to automate sending files via email, or how to connect to a certain database. Make a project out of it, even a mini-project that you can speak about later. Google will show you the way! Optimizing processes is sexy and it was the most frequently asked question in this job search. \n\n\n-\tIn case you couldn\u2019t tell, google and stackoverflow were lifesavers\n\n\n-\tTalk is cheap. A lot of people I know talk about taking classes and how excited they are. A year later they\u2019re in the same place. Learn it, use it, and continue learning. Spend less time talking about how you\u2019re gonna do something and work towards getting it done.\n\n\n-\tYou\u2019ll stumble through a lot of material- and that\u2019s okay. Not everything is connected in the beginning, and a lot of it will feel like wasted effort. Keep going! You\u2019ll reach the \u201caha!\u201d moment when everything clicks and you \u201cget it\u201d. It might take a year and a half, but think about what would have happened if you started a year and a half ago?\n\n\n-\tAdding to the last point, it\u2019s hard to know where to start and where to go. I\u2019ll summarize a cheap quick start guide for data science below if you\u2019re lost!\n\n\n-\tGet ready to make sacrifices. On average it was 3-4 hours daily, everyday, before or after work, and sometimes 6 hours on each of the weekend days. And this isn\u2019t counting the coding I did during work to make things more efficient, which is at least another 3-4 hours per workday. \n\n\n-\tI did take about 6-8 weeks off in total throughout the whole process though. You\u2019ll burn out sometimes, and that\u2019s okay! If you\u2019re as driven and passionate as I was, you\u2019ll come back to it weeks later, maybe even a month.\n\n\n-\tLastly, reddit is a place of vast knowledge of the field. Use it, go to r/learnprogramming or r/datascience or r/jobs or r/personalfinance. There will be questions and topics covering a lot of what I covered here.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**Quick start guide for data science:**\n\n\n(in no particular order)\n\n\n-\tIntroduction to Computer Science with Python from Edx.org\n\n\n-\tEither:\n\n\no\tAndrew Ng\u2019s Machine learning via coursera (not in python, but teaches you to know the matrix manipulation fundamentals)\n\n\no\tStatistical Learning via Stanford Lagunita (more theory than programming understanding, but covers similar concepts, and introduces R which is also a good tool)\n\n\n-\tPython Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp via Udemy\nAgain, this is just to get started. Google and stackoverflow will take you to the next level and other courses will fill the knowledge gaps. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nFull list of courses I\u2019ve completed:\n\n\u2022\tComplete Python Web Course from Udemy\n\n\u2022\tComplete Python and PostgreSQL Developer Course from Udemy\n\n\u2022\tDeeplearning.ai's Specialization from Coursera\n\n\u2022\tStatistical Learning from Stanford Lagunita\n\n\u2022\tPython for Data Science and Machine Learning from Udemy\n\n\u2022\tIntroduction to Data Science in Python from Coursera\n\n\u2022\tIntroduction to Computer Science and Programming using Python from Edx\n\n\u2022\tAnalytics Edge from Edx\n\n\u2022\tMachine Learning from Coursera\n\nThanks for reading! Wishing you the best in your data science journey. I hope it\u2019s as rewarding, exciting, and fruitful as it was for me.\n\n",

            "selftext": "A little bit of background... About 7 months ago I decided I needed a career change due to a number of reasons.  Working as a Mechanical Engineer was not fulfilling anymore and I started to hear more about Data Science and Machine Learning.  I've always had a passion for performing data analyses but never really considered it more than a responsibility of my various positions.  After looking more into the field of Data Science, I was immediately hooked and wanted to learn everything I could in this field.  \n\nI started with a subscription to Datacamp.com and worked my way through the Data Scientist Track with R path.  In addition, I took some courses on Coursera (Machine Learning with Andrew Ng) and EdX (Microsoft Professional Program for Data Science).  I exposed myself to some Kaggle competitions and went to a few local Data Science meetups.  These were great opportunities to network and speak with other Data Scientists/Analysts to see what they were working on and brush up on skills that would look great on my resume.  Ultimately, I focused on Python (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and seaborn), R, and SQL.  The above courses are great for getting your toes wet and introducing you to the basics.  Also, keep looking at r/datascience and reading of others success stories, they have some great roadmaps!\n\nWith my skill-set quickly growing, I began applying to jobs about 3 months ago.  Anyone who's been through the application process before will know that this is a painstakingly slow process so whatever you do, don't give up and keep applying!  I applied anywhere and everywhere that had a position that sounded interesting.  Most importantly, I was applying for positions I thought I could eventually do, not just the ones that I could do now.  All the while, still working on my skills through any free courses I could find.\n\nUp until about 3 weeks ago, I was getting very few responses to my applications with even less interviews.  Although discouraging, I didn't give up.  I have to throw a big thanks to my friends, and most particularly my roommates for keeping me going through this process.  The single biggest change through this process occurred after my roommate suggested I update my resume.  Not just the content, but the format and look too.  I reluctantly took this advice and spent a few hours crafting multiple revisions until I got something that I was happy with the result.\n\nAfter updating my resume and applying to a few new jobs, my responses skyrocketed, I couldn't believe it (I fully intend to create a time series of this whole process BTW).  I went from next to no interviews to multiple phone calls in a single day and multiple in-person interviews in a week.  Full disclosure, it takes more than a pretty resume to extend the interview process so obviously it helps to understand the content.  \n\nI quickly managed to talk my way into a few interviews and I now landed my first job offer with another two interviews finishing up shortly!  My biggest problem now is deciding what to do if I receive multiple offers but that is definitely a good problem to have.  I would have never thought I would be in this situation but it helps to know that it can happen to anyone so don't give up chasing your passions!\n\nI hope my story can serve as a little bit of inspiration to anyone else out there looking to make a career change, it's never too late!\n\nTL;DR\nBored of my current job, wanted a career change\nTook some online courses to learn Python, R, and SQL\nCreated pretty resume\nApplied to every job under the sun\nGot a job offer!",
