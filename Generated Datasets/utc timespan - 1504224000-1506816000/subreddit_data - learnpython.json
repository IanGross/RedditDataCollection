            "selftext": "Alright /r/learnpython, this one will be difficult to explain.\n\n**Background information, what did I try and what did I find out?**\n\nThis is only an idea I got for solving a problem in a raycaster game I am making, so I am not sure it will work.\nAnyway, I have a player looking at walls and a function that calculates the angle the player should look at (from a top-down-view) to be able to see those walls. This works, but I am having some rendering issues when the player is turning very fast. I found out, my game is having trouble deciding which walls should be within the player's field of view, which I do by using `atan2`. I collect coordinates from the player and each wall, then I use the angle of the direction the player is facing and find out if the wall is in front of the player. \n\n**My question**\n\nAs seen on [this beautiful image](https://i.imgur.com/z9CSY84.png), the coordinates on the walls are in the middle (cyan dots) by default, but I want them to be moved *as close to the coordinates of the player's line of sight as possible* (to the green dots). The distance to the player doesn't matter, but maybe it'll be easier to calculate that as well. \n\n**My non-optimal solution**\n\nI could make a lot of conditional statements to move the coordinate I am checking as close to the player as possible, by saying if the player's x coordinate is greater than the same on a wall, it'll move - and so on with all possibilities. However, this would not be optimal, since I am creating a game and this entire function is supposed to raise the framerate. I need a fast and simple solution if it is possible.\n\n**All suggestions are appreciated! Thank you very much :-)** ",

            "selftext": " Hey r/learnpython!\n\nLet me start off by saying my understanding my python is more on the casual side and I am in no way a professional, but I want to learn more.\n\nI recently just got a job as a QA engineer and a lot of my testing can be automated with scripts. I was then trying to figure out how to create an automation program. This program would essentially be a plug-and-play that would automatically power cycle a Mac (i.e. sleep, wake up, repeat for however many times. Same with restarts, hybernates, etc). The thought it to just be able to run it from a thumbdrive. \n\nNot really that sure on how to get started on something like this, so I thought maybe some of your expert minds can lead me in the right direction :) \n\nThanks!",

File 1 and file 3 both need to use some variables from file 2.

            "selftext": "So I'm attempting to parse Google Hangouts chat data, which is just a JSON file. My problem is Python 3 not handling surrogate pairs[1] that represent emojis, causing errors when I try to write them to a file. \n\nI'm particularly inspired by the following code:\n\nhttps://github.com/Karumi/hangout-slack-import/blob/master/hangout-to-csv-slack.py\n\nThe Python code mentioned above is designed to be run on Python 2, and therefore writes to a CSV file in binary mode[2]. My version I'm writing runs on Python 3, which means it instead writes to the CSV file in text mode[3]. The problem I'm running into is related to Unicode and surrogate pairs. The Google Hangouts chat data has emojis that are surrogate pairs, such as \\uD83D\\uDC26, which is a bird[4]. Writing this to a CSV in binary mode has no problems, but in text mode it causes an error. I've recreated the error in code below:\n\n    Python 3\n    >>> import csv\n    >>> with open('test.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:\n    >>>     hangoutswriter = csv.writer(csvfile)\n    >>>     hangoutswriter.writerow(['\\uD83D\\uDC26'])\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\n    File \"<stdin>\", line 3, in <module>\n    File \"C:\\Python36-32\\lib\\encodings\\cp1252.py\", line 19, in encode\n    return codecs.charmap_encode(input,self.errors,encoding_table)[0]\n    UnicodeEncodeError: 'charmap' codec can't encode characters in position 0-1: character maps to <undefined>\n\nAnd to show it working in Python 2 in binary mode:\n\n    Python 2\n    >>> import csv\n    >>> with open('test2.csv', 'wb') as csvfile:\n    >>>     hangoutswriter = csv.writer(csvfile)\n    >>>     hangoutswriter.writerow([**b**'\\uD83D\\uDC26'])\n\nThis second code sample works fine and writes to the file. I'm quite sure I understand what's happening, in that Python 2 just writes the characters in their binary representations to the file without any concern for what they represent. Whereas Python 3 tries to be smart and determine the \"Unicode representation\" of the value and fails. I'm not sure how to handle this. I don't want to lose any data, so removing the problematic sections does not seem to be a good answer. From what I can see there's no way to write in binary mode to CSVs using the Python CSV library in Python 3. Do I need to reinvent the wheel and override that? Or should I just use a different format like JSON Lines instead[5]? Where I can make the choice to write it in binary mode?\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-16#U.2B10000_to_U.2B10FFFF\n[2] https://docs.python.org/2/library/csv.html\n[3] https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html\n[4] http://www.charbase.com/1f426-unicode-bird\n[5] http://jsonlines.org/",

My current assignment tells me to create a class **Circle** with two attributes, radius and an object Point. I know how to set up the class **Point** to take an x and y variable, but for the life of me I can't figure out how to make class **Circle** take another object as an attribute. This is my code so far:\n\n    class Point:\n        def __init__(self, x, y):\n           self.x = x\n           self.y = y\n\n    class Circle:\n        def __init__(self, ???, radius):\n           ????\n           self.radius = radius\n\nI realized that I could simply use self.x and self.y to substitute a class **Point** object, but the wording on the assignment made it sound like I was only allowed 2 attributes- one being a **Point** object and the other being the radius.\n\nI apologize if this post isn't allowed on the subreddit.

Except, what?!, the function was still rewriting my first_list. That I wasn't even passing it!\n\nIt took a lot of time to figure out something way off that I didn't understand was going on. In short, dummy_list = first_list[:] was copying the top level of the list, but leaving the lower level components of the list as the same references in memory. So, still id(first_list) and id(dummy_list) produce different results, affect each other. \n\nTurns out [copy v. deep copy matters](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17246693/what-exactly-is-the-difference-between-shallow-copy-deepcopy-and-normal-assignm)\n\n>\n> The difference between shallow and deep copying is >only relevant for compound objects (objects that contain\n>  other objects, like lists or class instances):\n>\n> A shallow copy constructs a new compound object >and then (to the extent possible) inserts references into > it to the objects found in the original.\n>\n> A deep copy constructs a new compound object >and then, recursively, inserts copies into it of the >objects > found in the original.\n>\n\n[edits for formatting]",

It uses neopixels, and the library that operates these neopixels needs to use sudo in order to work (They are attached to the GPIO pins on the board).\n\nWhat I've done is made a python file that has the neopixels do what I want them to and then I am calling that file using \n\n    os.system(\"sudo python pixel_control.py on\")\n\nDoes anyone have a better suggestion to make this work?  I had the original script running with sudo in hopes that it I could call this controller script in a more logical way but it broke the sound on the project for some reason.

Type 'quit' to leave.\\n\"\n    prompt = \"To purchase a ticket, please give your age :\\n\"\n\n\n    active = True\n    message = input(prompt)\n\n\n    if message == 'quit':\n        active = False\n    else:\n        if int(message) < 3:\n           print(\"Your ticket is free.\")\n    \n\n        elif int(message) >= 3 and int(message) < 12:\n           print(\"Your ticket is $10.\")\n    \n\n        else:\n            print(\"Your ticket is $15.\")\n\n\nAs soon as the user enters his/her age, the program responds, then terminates. Obviously since this is the chapter on while loops, I need to use one here, but I'm not sure where to stick it; when I put it above the if-elif-else chain, the program replies with an infinite loop. What should I do?",

            "selftext": "Alright, hey guys. Like the title says I need some help. I've written an automated webscraper that scrapes every SCP foundation short story and saves it as an open office file, the program creates a new folder and then inside that folder creates a folder for every story that the program downloads, some of the stories have images some of them don't. I can get the images and download them and put them into their respective folder, but the issue is that when I go from a page that had an image to a page that doesn't, the url for the image stays the same and puts that image in a folder with a story that doesn't have an image. I'm having trouble finding the right control flow to either reset the image url or skipping the download portion for the code. I'm a noob and this is my first real program that I've put a lot of effort into and the code looks absolutely terrible. Im totally ok with flaming me, I gotta learn some way. :) thanks guys. link to paste bin below:\nhttps://pastebin.com/Ct3GYGmc\n\n\nThe nested While loop is an infinite loop that will fail once it hits the last url 4000+(I still need to add the right values so that it won't be infinite)\n\nTo run the code on linux, \nsudo python3 filename.py \n\nYou need to use sudo because of the fact that it makes folders and downloads content to your hard drive.\n\nFeatures I plan on adding in the future:\n-Choosing a different filetype.\n-Closing the program at any point without ctrl-c\n-Add logging\n-Im open to more suggestions!",

Though, if that's not possible I'll take whatever but please use a SPOILER tag. \n\n\n*Also, just to clarify - the reason I am here is because I can easily find the answer via google, but I won't learn anything by someone just giving me the answer with coding they've come up with.

The big problem I'm running into is finding a good clean way to organize managing and passing around the different hardware elements.  We effectively have 2 robot arms, a camera, a lighting system, force sensors, and various digital tools we interface with.  \n  \n  What I'm trying to figure out is how to manage and pass all of this around in a modifiable and abstract way.  I've considered a singleton approach, but the system becomes somewhat less flexible and we need to be able to switch up interfaces, which robots do which tasks, etc.  Also singleton side-effects can be dangerous so I'm wary.  We're currently passing around class instances to each function that uses the respective hardware interface, but this is quickly getting messy.  The third approach we've discussed is a container-like class instance that holds all of this, but it seems to be less explicit than the other approaches which can become pretty convoluted.  \n  \n  Any advice?",

If so, what would be the modules I can research to build this? Seems like it should be possible but not sure where to start.\n\nI'm fairly new to Python (< 6months), but I've been able to create some pretty awesome stuff and thought this might be a cool next project to try and build, since I can apply it to a real world issue I have. It's going to be above my level of competency but I'm happy to spend the time and work through it.\n\nBackground: I live in Australia and I've got an unreliable fixed line ADSL (8Mb down/386k up) connection. Fibre will be installed in the next few years, but I'm stuck with this for now. It'll stream Netflix / YouTube etc but it gets congested at peak times and if my gf is using it, there's no chance of playing games etc. \n\nDuring peak times I tether a 4G connection to my PC so that I can game -- I get good ping, reliable connection, however the cost of data is astronomical ($100 for 10 gig). So I've got to be super careful that I disable / swap internet connections if I want to watch anything. \n\nWould be way better if I could put something together that automagically split the traffic for me.\n\nAppreciate any help or advice. \n\nCheers,",

            "selftext": "Hi! Being that this is my first post here, let me start off by thanking you for taking the time to read this. Anyways, on to my question.\n\nI have a script partly working on Linux; here's the [hastebin](https://hastebin.com/ovajicogoc.py).\nThe script can detect when the user presses most keys when they're pressed almost instantaneously. However, if the user presses the \"escape\" key, the script freezes.\n\nHere's why it does this.\nAssume the user presses the \"escape\" key. The character `\\x1b` is then passed to the shell, typically. With this in mind, now assume the user presses \"F3\", or really any of the other function keys, such as \"Insert\", etc. These keys pass multiple characters to the shell. I.e., the \"F1\" key looks like `\\x1bOP`.\n\nNow, we know what the keys look like when received, and we know what to return to the user when they're pressed. The problem at hand being, we can't discern whether or not the user has pressed the \"escape\" key, or any of the various function keys without first reading one more byte with\n\n`sys.stdin.read(1)`\n\nThe `read(1)` method is blocking, and will continue to block until it receives another byte. However, without being able to break from this block based on some condition, I can't think of a way to tell whether or not the \"escape\" key has been pressed, nor can I stop the \"escape\" key from freezing the whole script entirely.\n\nIf you have any ideas as to a method I could use to do this, please feel free to share. The ultimate goal is to avoid using `curses` or any of it's derivatives, and to do this in pure python. A hefty goal to say the least, but if you have an ideas or encouragement, please don't hesitate to share.\n\nThanks a ton!\n*****\n\nEdit 1: I have looked into `select.select([sys.stdin], [], [], 0.0)` and it doesn't seem to be the solution. If you manage to find a way to either make it work, or find another solution, please share!",

Like, A imports B and B imports A and things don't work anymore.\n\nI also run into a problem now where I want to test my code but I  am not really able to mock things properly.\n\nI come from Java where this is quite easy. Usually you pass things via the constructor or a setter and if you want to test your stuff you just pass a mocked object and you're fine.\n\nI also have the problem now where I have my tests in a tests directory and my code in an app directory and when I wrote my test (like I usually do by simply calling the method and mocking everything that causes trouble due to the lack of a database) but instead of having problems with the missing database, the test simply didn't find the package (app.<whatever>)\n\nMy questions now are: how do I structure things to easily mock and test them. Also, how do I structure things in a way that makes cyclic imports not an issue. It seems like it's the same problem you have with C++ where the simple copy and paste approach to imports make forward declaration a must. Except that forward declaration doesn't work since everything is in one file.\n\nI'm mostly doing Flask stuff for the backend (so, REST APIs) with Python Flask seems to basically initialise everything in the main module (app). Like, you initialise Flask, you initialise SqlAlchemy and pass the flask instance, you initialise flask_whatever and pass the flask instance. And so on. I used to simply do the same and initialise my stuff there as well so I could get them via importing app.whatever. \n\nI'm not sure how I could mock that. Is that even a good approach?\n\nIs there something like dependency injection for python? \n\nAlso, how do I tell pytest where my app directory is.\n\nThanks.",

Once dash is pressed it will trigger lights on. When ARP will advertised twice, script will do full cycle, so lights will remain either on or off.\n\nI have tried time delay of 10 seconds but this just pauses the script for 10 seconds and after that time it will execute waiting commands.\n\nHappy to give more detail, really would like to get this going. Don't mind sharing full step by step how to control lights, once this project is completed.\n\nThank you! ",

            "selftext": "Hi I mostly used python for doing data analysis. However recently I decided to create some web apps that use scripts I wrote before. I heard that anaconda is not good for developing web applications.\nWhy is that so?\nWhat if my app runs on the code that involve all the packages from anaconda(pandas, numpy, scikit-learn etc.)? How should I approach app development in this case? Is it possible to develop apps in anaconda only? \n\nPlease if someone could shed some light on this I would be grateful",

            "selftext": "I do data entry and analysis for a small company. Some of what I do entails looking at data associated with specific dates. I've started writing a small program in python that sorts these dates by chronological order. Unfortunately it's at home and I'm at work. \n\nWhat it does so far is assign a variable to the string of dates. Then it replaces the / with -, because a forward slash makes some commands wonky. Then it splits the string into a list. What I'm trying to do next is convert the dates into datetime format, so I can use timedelta to sort them chronologically. My problem is I can't seem to get this to work. Does anyone have some ideas for getting this to work? I'll post the code later today.\n\nTo be clear, I'm not looking for a fully functioning program that is completely rewritten and I don't understand it.

But I always use input() instead of stdin and it works. Most of the times, my sample test cases pass. But when the judge tests the program with huge inputs, I get 'time-limit exceeded' error. I know the fact that I have to tweak my algorithm for efficiency. My question is, which one is more time efficient? stdin or input()? Does it really matter? \nExact sentence from the guidelines: All inputs for the programming problems are from STDIN and output to STDOUT",

Does something like this already exist? I'm sure it does.

So if room_A is set first, and has room_B set to the north, then room_B has room_A placed south.\n\nSo:\n\n     room_A.directions = \n     {\"North\":room_B,\"East\":None,\"South\":None,\"West\":None}\n     room_B.directions = \n     {\"North\":None,\"East\":None,\"South\":room_A,\"West\":None}\n\nThe difficulty I'm having is making the rooms all link back to each other in a way that makes sense. I can do this if I plot the rooms out myself manually, but if I'm doing this randomly it all falls apart.\n\nAny help would be appreciated - I've been told to look at matrices and doubly linked lists, but I'm not really sure where to start with those.",

Lab 1 and 2 were fine, and I understood what I was doing.\n\nI look up how to achieve some of their requests and I have no idea what is going on because I have no foundation on what 80% of these words mean. \n\nRight now, I am trying to make a nested list out of a normal list. I have been instructed to make a sub list to do this... and I understand *what* I am being asked to do. However when I try to look up what the inputs are to start doing this, I get lost in a sea of far more complex explanations that I cannot even begin to grasp. I don't know how to make a sublist, I have never been shown how like in previous labs.\n\nEdit: After 2 hours I finally found a forum that explained how to to this one part of the lab... now for 4 more. \n\nWhat should I do? Where should I actually start? What is a good guide? I've been trying to use python.org but it's not very helpful, and for some reason, many of the suggested inputs don't work like they're supposed to.\n\n1.) I did. I made a nested list from a normal list. I grouped together the list into groups of three. \n\n2.) Wants a dictionary. The data I have is currently groups like this [\u201820\u2019, \u201855\u2019, \u2018A\u2019]. There\u2019s a whole list like this. The goal is to have \n\ndata[\u2018A\u2019] \n\nOutput\n\n[\u201820\u2019, \u201855\u2019]\n\n3.) Use the code from #2 to make a function. \nDefine as:\n\ndef file_to_dict(filename):\n\nInput the file name, and the output should be the dictionary with the letters and grouped numbers. Save this function to a file so that it can be run and used with other data to do the same thing. \n\n4.) Make a function using the previous code from 2 that will count the number of letters. \n\n5.) Make a function that with user input on number limitations, will display the letters with numbers within these limitations for any file. \n\nEx. 10< X <100 and 3< y < 76 \n\nDisplays: \u2018C\u2019, \u2018F\u2019, \u2018H\u2019 which all have X, and y between these values.

However hitting the space bar only results in the player moving faster to the left direction only, and the left/right keys have no effect.\n\nI can see why this might not work because the left/right keys have already been assigned a function (move -10 or 10 respectively.)\nBut I can't see why hitting the space bar alone moves the player -15 along the axis since the condition for this requires both the space and left key to be pressed.\n\nAny ideas for achieving my goal here?",

Sometimes, it works perfect.\n\nThis compilable example section of code always executes to the error of len(offspring) == len(min(breederlist)) when chosen_len_offspring is bigger than len(min(breederlist)).\n\nAnd I don't know why.\n\n(Xposted to /r/justrolledintotheshop for some reason (???) )",

            "selftext": "I'm starting to learn the basics of Python3. Recently I've learned about nested for loops and decided to give an output pattern exercise in *Think Like A Programmer* a try.\n\nThe ultimate goal is to produce a half of a square of octothorpes/hash symbols (\\\"#\"). With the only output statements being the hash symbol and a newline argument. The end result looking like this:\n\n#####\n\n####\n\n###\n\n##\n\n#\n\nThe book's examples are in C++ which I don't know much about. But a few of the things I can recognize in the breakdown examples is the \"for\" function and the bracket delineation. So the first breakdown example is just printing 5 hash symbols in a straight line:\n\n     for (int hashNum = 1; hashNum <=5; hashNum++) {\n    cout << \"#\";\n    }\n    cout << \"\\n\"\n\nSimple enough, just a for loop, which is what I've been learning lately:\n\n    for i in range(0, 5):\n        print(\"#\", end=\"\")\n    print(\"\\n\")\n\nWorked perfectly. After that came the next step up which was to make a 5x5 gird of hashes. Again, simple, nest the first for loop in another one (nesting for loops is what I've learned most recently):\n\n    for row in range(0, 5):\n        for i in range(0, 5);\n           print(\"#\", end=\"\")\n       print(\"\\n\")\n\nAgain, perfect output 5x5 square. But now comes the original problem, making half of a square. The book states that an expression needs to be made that decreases as row increases. The final code being listed in C++ as:\n\n    for (int row = 1; row <= 5; row++) {\n        for (int hashNum = 1; hashNum <= 6 - row; hashNum++) {\n            cout << \"#\";\n       }\n       cout << \"\\n\";\n    }\n\nThe problem is that I can't figure out *how* to translate that to Python. My first attempts just gave me an endless loop that printed out hash symbols on one line. My latest attempt however prints out no hash symbols:\n\n    row = 1\n\n    while (6 - row) <= 1:\n        row += 1\n        print(\"#\", end=\"\")\n    print(\"\\n\")\n\nSo I'm at wit's end here. Does anyone have any suggestions or tips?\n\n**Edit:** well I found the solution. I was a bit too lazy to write down and diagram some stuff. Turns out I needed to initialize the two variables and use some if statements in there. The resulting code:\n\n    row = 1\n    hashNum = 1\n\n    for row in range(0, 6):\n        if row <= 6:\n            row += 1\n        for hashNum in range(0, 5):\n            if hashNum < 6 - row:\n                hashNum += 1\n                print(\"#\", end=\"\")\n        print(\"\\n\")\n\nAnd it works!",

That is False/True.\n    It is a tie. That is not False/True.\n\nI decided to first make a function that will return the above statements, and then add that function to another one which will prompt the players for their choices.\n\nThe code looks like this\n\n    def rps_combos(q, p):\n        \"rock\" > \"scissors\", \"paper\" > \"rock\", \"scissors\" > \"paper\"\n        result = q > p\n        result2 = not q == p\n        return print(\"Player 1 wins.

I have used Matlab for my thesis, and there it was easy to write a simple loop that would iterate over the values in a column, and based on the value in another column for that same row, would create a new column. What I have to figure out, is how to do the following in Python:\n\nI have three columns: the first is the index (daily dates; these are the rows, sorted from new to old), the second is the daily price of a stock and the third is a value, element of [0, 1, -1]. What I want to do, is:\n\n- if a row has the value \"0\" in the third column: assign the value 0 to the following day's row, fourth column;\n- if a row has the value \"1\" in the third column: compute the difference of tomorrow's and today's price (column 2), and assign this to the following day's row, in the fourth column.(see this as going long on a stock when the value in row 3 = 1, with the value assigned to the row of the following day in the 4th column being the gain/loss if I sell the stock again tomorrow and bought it today.);\n- if a row has the value \"-1\" in the third column: compute the difference of today's and tomorrow's price (imagine shorting a share of stock today and buying it back tomorrow), and assign this difference to tomorrow's row in column 4.\n\nIn Matlab, it would be easy to do something like this, because in the for-loop, we could easily iterate over rows, and use nested if-loops wherein one could compute the difference between rows i and i+1. How should I go about doing this in Python?\n\nThanks in advance!",

            "selftext": "Hi everyone, I have a 3 part question. I'm not super familiar with python and I everything I have is working, but I know it could be structured better. I'm using python 2.7 (no attachment to it, can move to more updated versions if it's advised)\n\nBackground: \n\nMy job has tasked me to make a self-service access tool so anyone in the company can just goto a simple interface, request access and the project creates the automated tickets and grants access automatically. This project will also eventually be tasked to do this like grant access to other systems that are not part of our centralized access and to create reports on who has access to what machine.\n\nOur company has an initiative to create our tasks/projects through Docker & Amazon's ECS services. I've built my python code using Flask, uWSGI, and Nginx to serve the application. I'm using supervisord to run both uWSGI and nginx inside the container. \n\nFirst Issue: Project Structure\n\n-Project\n\n--access\n\n---LDAPauth\n\n---static\n\n---templates\n\n---underscore2xinitunderscore2x.py\n\n--containerconf\n\n---.gitignore\n\n---Dockerfile\n\n---README.md\n\n---wsgi.py\n\nI want to build out more modules later. Like underneath the access area, I would like to have another access route (one using LDAP one using AWS) and to have underneath the project be a \"reports\" area. hThe project is going to handle all access related  issues and I would like it to handle all reports too. Is it better to have a separate project altogether for reports or can this tool handle both?\n\nSecond issue: __init__.py inside access\n\nCurrently, this file handle sets up some SQLAlchemy and internal DB setup, setting up logging for the rest of the project and does some builds for the it to pull in secret info. It seemed like it was doing too much and not the right place for all 3 tasks. Is this good practice to do these 3 tasks or should I break these down and create their own files/modules?\n\nThird: Logging.\n\nLastly, I got nginx, supervisorD and uwsgi logs to all report to stdout and stderr. I don't want to have all of uWSGIs logs, I just want the application logs. I tried setting up logger inside uwsgi.ini but have failed to get this setup.\n\nIf anyone wants to take a look, please let me know. I'm pretty sure I'm doing things right and I just need to keep at it and learn, but if anyone spots any issues or problems, please let me know!",

I just completed Chapter one, which was made a little more difficult by the moving targets of software updates.  I'd like to share what I did to overcome them, in case anyone else is following this or a similar course and needs a hint to get the right direction.\n\n*This was in a Windows 10 environment.*\n\n**Installing Minecraft**: Just buy the dumb game already.  If you use a pirated copy, you can't guarantee a stable interface on the right version of Minecraft.  Buy the game and install the latest version.  \n\n**Installing Python**: Install the latest version.  *Take note of where your Python install folder is.*  \n* My install was at %AppData%\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python36-32\\Lib\\site-packages\n\n**Java**:  Mine was already installed.  If you don't have it installed, install the latest version.  Read the comments in case I'm wrong.\n\n**Minecraft Python API and Spigot**:  I installed the latest version found at: nostarch.com/pythonwithminecraft/.  Pay attention to where you put the extracted folder.  This will be where the Spigot server comes from.  After installing is where the issues began to crop up.\n\n1. The spigot version used for the game server may not match your game version.  You will notice when you go to connect to the game and it displays a different version than your game version and tells you that you can't connect.  \n\n* Follow the instructions at [www.spigotmc.org](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/buildtools/) which I have outlined below\n* Obtain [Git for Windows](https://git-for-windows.github.io/)\n* Get [JRE 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html).  You can try 9, but I can't tell you if it will work properly, and this is something to come back to if you still have problems.\n* Find the link on the spigotmc page above to download buildtools\n* Open the git bash application you downloaded and installed above\n* Run the following code in the Windows Command Prompt (cmd) in order to download the correct version of the tools.  If you Minecraft version isn't 1.12.1, substitute the version you are using instead of 1.12.1 below:\n\n    'java -jar BuildTools.jar --rev 1.12.1'\n\n* Move the buildtools.jar to your Minecraft Tools folder\n* Copy the spigot jar file to Minecraft Tools\\server and rename it to spigot.jar\n\n2\\. The API installed to a different folder than the correct one.

Let's see what `dis.dis()` has to say:\n\n    >>> from dis import dis\n    >>> dis(recursive_factorial)\n      2           0 LOAD_FAST                0 (num)\n                  2 LOAD_CONST               1 (2)\n                  4 COMPARE_OP               0 (<)\n                  6 POP_JUMP_IF_FALSE       12\n    \n      3           8 LOAD_CONST               2 (1)\n                 10 RETURN_VALUE\n    \n      4     >>   12 LOAD_FAST                0 (num)\n                 14 LOAD_GLOBAL              0 (f)\n                 16 LOAD_FAST                0 (num)\n                 18 LOAD_CONST               2 (1)\n                 20 BINARY_SUBTRACT\n                 22 CALL_FUNCTION            1\n                 24 BINARY_MULTIPLY\n                 26 RETURN_VALUE\n    >>> dis(while_factorial)\n      2           0 LOAD_FAST                0 (num)\n                  2 POP_JUMP_IF_FALSE        8\n                  4 LOAD_FAST                0 (num)\n                  6 JUMP_FORWARD             2 (to 10)\n            >>    8 LOAD_CONST               1 (1)\n            >>   10 STORE_FAST               1 (ans)\n    \n      3          12 SETUP_LOOP              28 (to 42)\n            >>   14 LOAD_FAST                0 (num)\n                 16 LOAD_CONST               1 (1)\n                 18 COMPARE_OP               4 (>)\n                 20 POP_JUMP_IF_FALSE       40\n    \n      4          22 LOAD_FAST                0 (num)\n                 24 LOAD_CONST               1 (1)\n                 26 INPLACE_SUBTRACT\n                 28 STORE_FAST               0 (num)\n    \n      5          30 LOAD_FAST                1 (ans)\n                 32 LOAD_FAST                0 (num)\n                 34 INPLACE_MULTIPLY\n                 36 STORE_FAST               1 (ans)\n                 38 JUMP_ABSOLUTE           14\n            >>   40 POP_BLOCK\n    \n      6     >>   42 LOAD_FAST                1 (ans)\n                 44 RETURN_VALUE\n    >>> dis(for_factorial)\n      2           0 LOAD_FAST                0 (num)\n                  2 POP_JUMP_IF_FALSE        8\n                  4 LOAD_FAST                0 (num)\n                  6 JUMP_FORWARD             2 (to 10)\n            >>    8 LOAD_CONST               1 (1)\n            >>   10 STORE_FAST               1 (ans)\n    \n      3          12 SETUP_LOOP              32 (to 46)\n                 14 LOAD_GLOBAL              0 (range)\n                 16 LOAD_FAST                0 (num)\n                 18 LOAD_CONST               1 (1)\n                 20 BINARY_SUBTRACT\n                 22 LOAD_CONST               2 (0)\n                 24 LOAD_CONST               3 (-1)\n                 26 CALL_FUNCTION            3\n                 28 GET_ITER\n            >>   30 FOR_ITER                12 (to 44)\n                 32 STORE_FAST               2 (i)\n    \n      4          34 LOAD_FAST                1 (ans)\n                 36 LOAD_FAST                2 (i)\n                 38 INPLACE_MULTIPLY\n                 40 STORE_FAST               1 (ans)\n                 42 JUMP_ABSOLUTE           30\n            >>   44 POP_BLOCK\n    \n      5     >>   46 LOAD_FAST                1 (ans)\n                 48 RETURN_VALUE\n\n...what?

            "selftext": "Hey! I'm trying to write a while loop, which won't stop until a function (checker(x,y,z)) returns a certain value. Inside the loop, the value z is changed in a certain way, in order (in theory) to receive a different output from checker(x,y,z). \nHowever, I was running the code and it would go into an infinite loop. After adding print statements I realized the value z was in fact not changing. I don't understand what the mistake is and I'm a bit desperate. Here is the code, any feedback is appreciated, but specifically to what is wrong with the loop:\n\n    while checker(debt,interest_rate,FPM) != 0.01:\n         print(FPM)\n         print(debt)\n         if checker(debt,interest_rate,FPM) > 0:\n             lower = FPM\n             FPM = (lower + upper)/2 \n        elif checker(debt,interest_rate,FPM) < 0:\n            upper = FPM\n            FPM = (lower + upper)/2    \n        else:\n            continue\n        debt = balance\n\n\n\nIn theory, FPM should change with each iteration, but it doesn't, it just uses the the value of FPM defined earlier in the code. \n\n\nEDIT 1: [FULL CODE](https://pastebin.com/UXkGDazY)\n\n\nEDIT*: Woops, clearly I should have posted the rest of my code! Sorry, I mistakenly assumed it was trivial. First, checker() returns an integer value based on a few calculations, but it is either grater than 0 or smaller than 0. Second, my problem is the fact that FPM does not change through each iteration and I don't understand why it doesn't\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nEDIT: SOLVED IT! Finally realized what was wrong with the while loop. I had it set to not stop until debt was equal to 0.1, but that was VERY unlikely. I then realized that the problem permited debt to be between 0.01 and -0.01 from the right answer, so I made the adjustments and the code ran flawlessly. Thank's to everybody who helped and sorry for the inconvenience, just starting out. I also abandoned using the checker function for efficiency.\n[FULL CORRECT CODE](https://pastebin.com/SeUyrArB)\n",

Then I constructed a custom database (I don't know mySQL or any database so I designed my crappy implementation, see src/Database.py).  \nThe bot internal mechanics have 4 fundamental data structures:  \n\n* src/ContentVote.py -> is how the media (pictures, gifs, files, ...) are stored\n* src/UserProfile.py -> is how the users are stored in the bot (nickname, points, karma, ...)\n* src/Category.py -> how the categories are managed\n* src/Supergroups.py -> the bot can be used in group chats, this class manages the chat preferences\n\nThese classes are managed by the (src/CategoriesManager.py) which coordinates what happens in between the above structures.\nThe other files in the repository are helper class and conventions definitions (like the NSFW tags and so on...).\n\nIf anybody is interested, I think I can bundle up a little tutorial, even if my code shouldn't be taken as an example.\n\nThe source code\n--------------------\nI'm not so good at writing code, I realized it by having this \"big\" project, I would like to ask you comments and suggestions on how to make the code more readable.\nI already know about PEP8 and the python mantra. Yet I would like to know from you what you prefer when you see a code in github (file organization, file length, ...)\n\n\nPs: if you have telegram the bot link is (https://t.me/DirtyRateBot), the bot like reddit can be NSFW, but has also SFW categories.",

It rewinds and goes to the latest call. which was when s = \"bc\" i was 0, so now i =1, s = \"b\", p calls the function again. And since the length is 1, it returns just the length. My question is what value does p get? I assume it is the return value of perm(s) which, in this case, is \"b\". And I assume that before for x in p: runs p needs to have a value.

I am trying to learn python and have started by trying to make extremely simple functions/applications/etc.  Here, I attempted to make something that could keep track of students' grades...and I started by nesting a couple dictionaries inside each other.

And the massive chunk of code below is a massive amount of if and else statements.\n\nNow, the way I interpret how python runs this code is that it checks whether x is 8 or 9, and then skips it if it isn't. However for this example:\n\n      if x == 9:\n           something\n      elif x == 8:\n           something\n      #again.... massive code below\n\nI believe it has to run through each and every if statement. Assuming I am correct, the top code is faster . This may seem negligible at first, but if the program has to do the code above multiple times (For example... the code above is indented in a massive for loop), and the \"If x is 8 or 9\" if statements are massively nested if statements. \n\nSo am I right to say that the top code is faster for this scenario because x being 8 or 9 happens rarely and it has to go through less if statements? Or is Python smart and somehow makes the 2 equal speed?\n\n\n\n",

That is, you can never get a probability of 1 in your simulation.\nThis bothers me. Maybe not a huge issue for this dummy coin toss example, but there will be times in your projects when you want to simulate certain scenarios, and you would want the 100% option to be on the table.\n\nI know there are other ways to get around it and get 1 to be inclusive, what I'm asking here is if I'm missing anything and am I right to have concerns.\n\nThanks!",

            "selftext": "I have three pre-specified lists to create a \"graph\", src = [0,0,1,4,2,3,4], dest = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6], arc = [0,0,5,2,4,1,1], and an empty path list.  All three given lists have a direct correspondence; that is, an arc with source node 4 (src[3]) and destination node 3 (dest[3]) will appear 2 (arc[3]) times in a list of paths.\n\nI'm trying to construct a list of paths based on a graph WITHOUT using NetworkX.  The \"graph\" effectively looks like this:  there is a path 1-2-4-6 and then a branch from 4 that's 4-3-5.  An index in the path list should basically be a path from 1 to the index, so path[2] corresponds to a path from 1-2, path[4] corresponds a path from 1-4, etc.  The path list is supposed to look like this through each iteration:\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0] (initialize with dummy node 0, path[0] done; this part isn't really important)\n\n[0,1,1,1,1,1,1] (node 1 connects to all nodes, path[1] done)\n\n[0,1,12,12,12,12] (node 2 connects to nodes 3-6 and terminates path 1-2, path[2] done)\n\n[0,1,12,124,124,124,124] (node 4 connects to nodes 3-6 and terminates path 1-4, path[4] done)\n\n[0,1,12,1243,124,1243,124] (node 3 connects only to node 5 and terminates path from 1-3, path[3] done)\n\n[0,1,12,1243,124,12435,124] (node 5 terminates path 1-5, path[5] done)\n\n[0,1,12,1243,124,12435,1246] (node 6 terminates path 1-6, path[6] done)\n\nThe path list will be strings even though I omitted the apostrophes. \n\nI'm having a difficult time correctly looping through all these lists and concatenating the strings based on the values.  I FEEL LIKE I should start my loop through the destination list, since that's just [0,1,2,3,4,5,6], grab the source at the same index, and then insert this into the path list's strings, but what I'm really struggling with is just STRUCTURING the correct order of things.\n\nIf possible, I'd like some help just getting my thoughts organized properly so I can encode them.\n\n**EDIT**:  I figured it out.  Turns out I didn't even need the arc list or the destination list.  Since I was forcing my path list to be of the form path[i] = path from node 1 to node i, I could just initialize path = ['0','1','2','3','4','5','6'], set some index = 6 and make a while loop where index counts down to 0.  Inside this while loop, I kept iterating over path[i] and checking if the first character is equal to my index; if so, append to the front of it the predecessor of the node (so 4 connects to 6, ergo the predecessor of 6 is 4).  Once index reached 0, I just checked to see if the first character of every single entry in path was 0.  If yes, break the while.  If not, reset index to 6, and start all over.\n\nNot the most efficient, I know, but it did what I needed to do.",

I'm implementing things at a steady rate, but I'm having issues with saving and loading the world, specifically the loading part.\n\nI have to warn you, while I don't exactly keep up with coding standards, I know my code has a lot of idiosyncrasies and is probably ugly to read for other people.\n\nAnyways, what I'm doing is trying to pickle my dictionary that contains a bunch of Room objects. I don't know if messing with getstate on the Room does anything negative, I did it too stop it from saving the 'players' property so that it would load without needing the same players in the game. (I think I'm understanding that right...) The error happens after loading the world and then using say, look, move, warp (if given an id), info... but not roomlist. \n\nI have no idea where to go from here, it's stopped making sense to me.

That is, the first example worked because Timestamp knew how to compare itself to a str, which would imply the second example should work. But the fact that these produce different outputs suggests otherwise. I had a look at the documentation [here](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.Series.gt.html) but it didn't have any further information about type conversion. Does anyone have some insight as to how to make sense of what's going on here?\n\nThanks!",

They must be done at the same time because the API does not allow too many calls. This line automatically creates the poster column in the df with the necessary information. \n\n    self.df['poster'] = self.df['title'].apply(lambda title: self.get_data(title))\n\nIm not sure if this is too confusing but my brain hurts and i cannot figure this out.

Just finish your book or your blog you are reading and if you feel confident enough (or even not!) start a little project.\n\nIf you have no clue where to start in the first place [take a look at this summary in /r/learnpython's wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/index#wiki_new_to_programming.3F).\n\n***\n\n#Projects\n\n- webscraping: Using libraries like `requests` or `beautifulsoup` to scrape websites of their content (e.g. webcomics)\n\n- API's: similar to webscraping, use the data from websites (normally in `JSON`-format)\n\n- Twitter: `tweepy` is the go. Have fun with tweeting and analysis, but you need a twitter account and API-token\n\n- Reddit: You can use `praw` to work with the reddit-API to build bot's or do analysis\n\n- Websites: `flask` and `django` are commonly used python-frameworks for web-programming\n\n- math & analysis: `numpy` and `pandas` will be your best friend as well as the plotting library `matplotlib`\n\n- file's and more: the `os` library can handle a lot of file-specific tasks, `shutil` is also useful\n\n- Games: `pygame` is not only useful for games, also for simulations\n\n- GUI: `pyQT` is good for that, you may use `tkinter` or `wxpython` too (thanks /u/jimminy)\n\n\n\n#Links\n\n- [CodingBat](http://codingbat.com/python). Very good for beginners \n\n- [little list of different projects](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TyqD2_oDtiQIh_Y55J5RfeA91JJECc97xYIKM112H9I/mobilebasic?pref=2&pli=1)\n\n- [martyr2s-mega-project-ideas](http://www.dreamincode.net/forums/topic/78802-martyr2s-mega-project-ideas-list/). Huge list for beginners-advanced\n\n- [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/). Math heavy, but a lot of fun if you like problem-solving\n\n- [/r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/). A subreddit for different project ideas\n\n---\n\n\nAnd obviously everything else you can imagine or automate. \n\nFeel free to leave other suggestions or comments, so we can both extend this compilation.\n",

            "selftext": "Hi, picked up coding again by practicing some questions from competitions I attended in highschool. One of the questions [here](https://orac.amt.edu.au/cgi-bin/train/problem.pl?set=simple3&problemid=416) is as follows: \n\nInput File: listin.txt\n\nOutput File: listout.txt\n\nTime Limit: 1 second\n\nMemory Limit: 64MB\n\n*The face of electronic gaming has changed dramatically over the past few decades. Forget text adventure games and rickety Asteroids cabinets - these days it's all about ultra-realistic graphics, motion-sensing wands and high-end CPUs. But despite all this, simple games with basic rules and crisp art are doing as well as ever. One such game is Friendlist, a multiplayer game requiring nothing more than an internet browser to play.*\n\n*In Friendlist, players add each other as 'friends' based on looks, reputation, or even real life connections. (Friendship is mutual: if Alice has Bob as a friend, then Bob has Alice as a friend too. Of course, people cannot be friends with themselves.) As the game progresses, dedicated players can grind their way through quiz-like minigames in order to impress their peers. However, adding 'friends' to one's friendlist remains the cornerstone of the game. The bigger the friendlist, the better the player.*\n\n*The object of the game is to have the biggest friendlist (that is, the most friends). Your task here is to take a list of Friendlist friendships and determine the winner. There may be more than one person tied for first place: if so, your program should list them all.*\n\n**Input**\n\nThe first line of input will contain the integer f, 1 <= f <= 1,000,000.\n\nEach of the following f lines will be of the form \"a b\", where a and b are different player IDs. This indicates that player #a is friends with player #b, and vice versa. All player IDs are integers between 0 and 1000 inclusive.\n\n(Note that no friendship will ever be listed twice: for example, if \"2 5\" is one of the lines in the input, then neither \"2 5\" nor \"5 2\" will appear anywhere else in the input.)\n\n**Output**\n\nOutput should consist of all the player IDs that are tied for biggest friendlist. These IDs should be given in ascending order.\n\nAnd here is my code:\n[version 1](https://pastebin.com/wCGuPQ3C)\n[version 2](https://pastebin.com/UMySmuUE)\n\nDespite passing the first few test cases in the question, it apparently crashed/timed out on the larger/fringe cases. I do not have access to the test cases, and I have no idea why they crashed/timed out. I wrote a script to make test cases for myself within the constraints given (n <1,000,000, 1 < ID < 1000) and the script passed through most cases fine. I also did some fringe cases that I can think of (e.g. all items ranked the same), and the script passed through that also. I spent the whole night trying to improve my code, but at the moment I am at a limit where I am not sure how I can optimize it to pass through all possible cases. I read some stuff on algorithmic complexity but I am not sure how to estimate that in my own code either. Any suggestions on the code is greatly appreciated, and if you have any resources on further learning algorithm stuff that would be great also! \n\nThank you for reading through this, cheers!",

I was wondering if it would be better to give each piece their position (`x, y`) and then just store a list of all the pieces, or if the pieces shouldn't know of their own position but instead I'd use a dict like so:\n\n    board = {\n        (x, y): Piece(<color>, <type>)\n        for bla bla in bla bla\n    }\n\nFrom an OOP standpoint it seems better to let the pieces know of their own position, but from performance standpoint it seems better to have a map of the pieces, as this allows me to quickly seek a piece at a certain position with `board[x, y]` (`O(1)`, as opposed to looping over all the pieces to find the one at position `x, y` (`O(n)`)).\n\nAny thoughts?\n\n----\n\nUpdate: Also, the `Piece` class has an abstract method `get_possible_move_locations(self, board)`, which is why I originally figured it'd be nice to have its position known to itself.",

This is causing the script to fail to recognize the tags in the .cue file.\n\nThe line\n\n    if line.startswith('  TRACK '):\n\nis never true even though I can clearly see matching lines when I open the .cue file in an editor.\n\nWhen I execute this code for lines that *should* match:\n\n    print(str(ord(line[0])) + ' ' + str(ord(line[1])) + ' ' + str(ord(line[2])) + ' ' + str(ord(line[3])))\n\nwhat I get is:\n\n    0 32 0 32\n\nHowever it prints normally on the console.\n\nI figured this is all happening due to some issue with the encoding of the .cue file, but I'm so far at a loss for how to address it.

A part of my subthread's run() function reads:\n\n    for pos in it.product([5],range(12),range(12)): \n        forceField += np.reshape(list(it.imap(fieldstr,it.product(range(12),repeat=3),it.repeat(pos))),(12,12,12)).transpose()\n\nwhen this specific bit of code is ran in the main thread, it takes approximately 0.56 seconds on average. However, when run as part of the subthread run() function, this for loop takes approximately **9.3 seconds** to run. For reference, the fieldstr function reads:\n\n    def fieldstr(pos,secpos):\n        r = np.sqrt((pos[0] - secpos[0])**2 + (pos[1] - secpos[1])**2 + (pos[2] - secpos[2])**2)\n        if (r != 0): return massArr[secpos[0]][secpos[1]][secpos[2]] / (r**2)\n        else: return 0\n\nMy point here being that no variables from outside the subthread are being accessed when that thread runs the for loop, and yet it takes a massive amount of time. My only theories as to why are either:\n\nThe subthread takes much more time accessing a module (such as itertools or numpy) that was imported in the main thread\n\nor\n\nFor some reason, the subthread struggles in running a function defined outside of the Thread() class\n\nHowever, I am not particularly sure of either, and would not be sure either way how I could speed up the process.

In previous posts it was hard for me to describe what I was trying to do as I see a page with thousands of pages and obviously has tables, but pd.read_html doesn't work! Until it hit me, this page has a form to be filled out first.... \n\n\nhttps://opir.fiu.edu/instructor_eval.asp\n\n\n\nGoing to this link will allow you to select a semester, and in doing so, will show thousands upon thousands of tables. I attempted to use the URL after selecting a semester hoping to read HTML, but no such luck.. I still don't know what I'm even looking at (like, is it a webpage, or is it ASP? What even IS ASP?). If you follow the video link, you'll see that it gives an ugly error if you select spring semester, copy the link, and put it in the search bar. Some SQL error. \n\n\nSo this is my dilemma. I'm trying to GET this data... All these tables. Last post I made, I did a brute force attempt to get them by just clicking and dragging for 10+ minutes, then pasting into excel. That's an awful way of doing it, and it wasn't even particularly useful when I imported that excel sheet into python because the data was very difficult to work with. Very unstructured. So I thought, hey, why not scrape with bs4? Not that easy either, it seems, as the URL won't work. After filtering to spring semester, the URL just won't work, not for you, and not if you paste it into python for bs4 to use...\n\n\nSo I'm sort of at a loss here of how to reasonably work with this data. I want to scrape it with bs4, and put it into dataframes to be manipulated later. However, as it is ASP or whatever it is, I can't find a way to do so yet :\\ \n\n",

I can't get the math to work the way it is currently and was wondering if anyone had a second to look at the code and point me in the right direction...?\n\nThe Problem\n================================\n\u2022\tCreate a file named WaterUsage.py\nResidential and business customers are paying different rates for water usage.  Residential customers pay $0.004 per gallon for the first 8000 gallons.  If the usage is more than 8000 gallons, the rate will be $0.007 per gallon after the first 8000 gallons.  Business customers pay $0.005 per gallon for the first 10000 gallons.  If the usage is more than 10000 gallons, the rate will be $0.009 per gallon after the first 10000 gallons.  For example, if a business customer has used 12000 gallons, they need to pay $50 for the first 10000 gallons ($0.005 * 10000), plus $18 for the other 2000 gallons ($0.009 * 2000).  Write a program to do the following.  Ask the user which type of customer they are and how many gallons of water they have been used.  Calculate and display the bill.  \n\nMy Code So Far\n==================================\ngallons = float(input('How many gallons were used? '))\n\ncustomer = input('Residential or Business Customer? ')\n\nresidential = 'residential'\n\nbusiness = 'business'\n\nvar1 = 0.004\n\nvar2 = 0.007\n\ntotal = var1 + var2\n\nif residential and gallons <= 8000:\n    print('Price for first 8000 gallons is - $', var1 * gallons)\n\nif residential and gallons >= 8001:\n    print('Price for over 8000 gallons - $', (gallons - 8000) * var2)",

To detect a variable's type, I need to, for example:\n\n    import pandas\n    if isinstance(variable,pandas.DataFrame):\n        ...\n\nwhich works, but importing pandas is SLOW. Obviously, if I need to do it, I need to do it. But I do not want to import it by default.\n\nIs there a clean, robust, pythonic way to check the type and only then import it as needed? Actually, I wouldn\u2019t even need to import it since I could just call the needed method (`to_dict()`) though I guess I would need it to recover it.\n\nI do **not** simply want to rely on ducktyping and check for a `to_dict()` method since I won't know how to recover it.\n\nI can do\n\n    type(variable).__name__ == 'DataFrame'\n\nbut that seems risky.\n\nThanks!",

Wouldn't median[list] return the same result?  Why is int(len(numbers)/2) be necessary to find the median of a list of numbers?",

For  example, if s = 'azcbobobegghakl', then your program should print\n\n    Longest substring in alphabetical order is: beggh\n    In the case of ties, print the first substring. For example, if s = 'abcbcd', then your program should print\n\n    Longest substring in alphabetical order is: abc\n\nAnd here is my code:\n\n    string = ''\n\n    bestString = s[0]\n\n    for i in range(len(s)):\n\n        if len(string) == 0:\n\n            string = string + s[i]\n\n        elif len(string) > 0:\n\n            if s[i] >= string[len(string) - 1]:\n\n                string = string + s[i]\n\n                if len(string) > len(bestString):\n\n                    bestString = string\n\n                elif len(string) == len(bestString):\n\n                    bestString = bestString\n\n                else:\n\n                    string = string\n\n            elif s[i] < string[len(string) - 1]:\n\n                string = s[i]\n\n    print(bestString)\n\nThanks in advance for the tips!",

I shorten the array to a set of the entries, so I don't look twice at the same number. But I am still not fast enough. If I had to guess I would say the problem lies with the fact-function.

The purpose of this is to call the same function on the expanded string created by each marker, continually expanding markers until the string is fully 'decompressed'.\n\nWhat I can't understand is why this function returns an integer of the length of the string? I know it's maybe because of the conditional at the top of the function which would get called when the for loop ends, but where is the ever-expanding string being stored in memory? I thought they were immutable? So it works, but I'm wondering *how*.",

So far, this is my code:\nhttps://gist.github.com/dutchsparks/2a077c0eeb5007464bbe32383333022a\n\nWhen it's run, an entry field and submit button appear in which a user can enter its username. When he clicks submit, his username and his health points are printed on the screen.  Like so:\nhttps://imgur.com/a/N79zv\n\nHowever, I would like the text to appear without the entry field and submit button. So I guess I want to switch to a different page. I can't seem to figure out how to do this though. I tried putting the entry  field and submit button on a frame and then use pack_forget on the frame when the button is pressed. But I ran into some errors doing that.\n\nRegardless of why I exactly ran into an error while doing that, would that even be the way to go? Or are there other methods that I should try to use?\nI would love to learn! :)",

I do not have experience designing programs but from my understanding having a well structured class relationships can make development easier.\n I made a primitive [diagram](https://imgur.com/a/M6yjw) to explain the concept. \n\nA word description:  imports would be in their own small box followed by another box with code which is before first initialization of class. Then there would be a bunch of class boxes in hierarchical view connected with lines to show who is who's child. There will be an option to show only updated code (new/changed methods). At the end there will be another box with any left over code. If there will be code between classes there will be a small box (probably minimized by default or to the side of the class hierarchy). Of course you would be able to create code in this editor too and save it (I am debating if having a new class box created would substitute declaration of a class but more likely it won't). If you guys have any ideas on how I can improve this idea before I start working, it would be great!\n\nHow the project will evolve:\n\n-I will try to create min viable product and post it on github under general public license v3 or later (so any contributions added would have to be under gpl v3 or later too). If I fail, then there will be nothing or another fail project will be added to my awesome collection, so if someone else wants to take it over they can.",

I wasted probably 100+ hours worrying if my code would be seen as amateur or \"Not pythonic\"  \n  \nThe result is king. If it works, then congrats on You! Just keep chugging along and making your code work successfuly \n\n:edit: anybody that disagrees with this, simply forgot what it was like to first start this programming stuff or you learned in school from a teacher doing drill after drill. Hooray for you. This message is not for you as you simply will lack the empathy of what it is like to learn programming on your own in this day and age. \n\nThis message is for self starters like me who just want to focus on wrapping their head around basic concepts: \"for loops\" , \"dictionaries\" \"operators\" \"flow control\"  and \"functions/methods/classes\" \n\nIt's not for people with a basic knowledge of programming. \n\nAfter you are comfortable with programming (the above shit) THEN check out the conventions.

If number is even, then collatz() should print number // 2 and return this value. If number is odd, then collatz() should print and return 3 * number + 1.\n\nThen write a program that lets the user type in an integer and that keeps calling collatz() on that number until the function returns the value 1.\nEnter number:\n3\n10\n5\n16\n8\n4\n2\n1\n\nHere is my code.  https://pastebin.com/9MfjcG79\n\nI have been able to get it running correctly, but only after including the last if statement outside the while scope. I think its a less than ideal solution and am confused and why it doesn't work otherwise.\n\nI am not sure if its because the function is recursive and is going through all of its stack calls. Somehow it goes through the correct sequence of numbers and then repeats an output of 1 again, then it jumps to 2 and continues on. \n\n\n",

I've searched all over and I've found similar questions but not this one exactly. I'm still confused. I'm working on on a personal project and trying to learn at the same time. Any help is much appreciated.\n\nSo basically I'm trying to filter out a continuous loop that has a constant feed of strings coming in(from an API).\n\nHeres an example of the code I'm using -\n\nI have a filter set up with an array like so:\n    \n    filter_a = ['apples and oranges', 'a test', 'bannanas']\na function I found on Stackoverflow like this:\n\n    def words_in_string(word_list, a_string):\n        return set(word_list).intersection(a_string.split())\n    title = 'bananas'\n    #(this is a continuously looping thing, so sometimes it \n    # might be for example 'apples and oranges')\n\nAnd my if statement:\n\n    if words_in_string(filter_a, str(stringtomatch.lower())):\n        print(stringtomatch.lower())\nFor some reason it would detect 'bananas' but not 'apples and oranges'. It will skip right over strings with multiple words. I can't figure out why. I'm guessing it's because of the split() but I'm not sure. Anyone able to help? Thanks!!!\n\nEdit: Here's another way to put it. I'm trying to make this print successful\n    \n    title = 'this is 1'\n    \n    word_list = ['this is','a test']\n    \n    if title in word_list:\n    \tprint(\"successful\")\n    else:\n    \tprint(\"unsuccessful\")\n\nEven if word list only matches part of title, i'd like it to be successful",

(This is for a research project that I am not graded on nor receiving credit from.) So here's where Python comes in:\nI have to write a program that I can copy and paste DNA sequences into and get an entire amino acid sequence from. I've used BioPython however it doesn't show me the entire sequence (which is pointless with the DOE's database) I'm using Python 3.6 .\n\nTo elaborate on some biological terms: A nucleotide is a single piece of a DNA strand (Either A, G, T, or C). An Amino Acid is similar, but for proteins. A codon is a group of three nucleotides that translates into an amino acid. Transcription is how an enzyme reads the DNA or RNA sequence and makes it into an amino acid chain based on the codons. Some codons \"Start\" the transcription process. Some \"Stop\" the transcription process until it finds another \"Start\" codon so it can start all over with a different group of nucleotides on the same DNA strand. Imagine Kramer in Seinfeld painting over the street lines with black paint. Kramer is the enzyme, the street lines start with a start codon and stop with a stop codon, and the black paint is essentially the amino acids. I need to program Kramer.\nI found some methods online, but each comes with their own issue.\n\nMethod 1: http://www.petercollingridge.co.uk/book/export/html/474\n\n1 bases = ['t', 'c', 'a', 'g']\n\n2 codons = [a+b+c for a in bases for b in bases for c in bases]\n\n3 amino_acids = 'FFLLSSSSYY**CC*WLLLLPPPPHHQQRRRRIIIMTTTTNNKKSSRRVVVVAAAADDEEGGGG'\n\n4 codon_table = dict(zip(codons, amino_acids))\n\nI can use this by typing codon_table ['Any three nucleotides'] and get in return a single codon. However, this can only handle 3 nucleotides at a time, and doesn't take into account the fact that the sequence needs to start with a start codon, and should end with a stop codon. I've tried the rest of the code and it won't work with python 3. At least it does work by changing xrange to range, but I only get ' ' in return. How can I use this to look at a DNA strand starting with the first Start Codon and going in groups of 3 until the first Stop Codon? And can it repeat this process for multiple set of start/stop codons on the same strand, printing off each amino acid sequence?\n\nMethod 2: \nhttp://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dna-protein-python-3/\n\n1 inputfile =\"DNA_sequence_original.txt\"\n\n2 f = open(inputfile, \"r\")\n\n3 seq = f.read()\n \n4 seq = seq.replace(\"\\n\", \"\") \n5 seq = seq.replace(\"\\r\", \"\")\n \n6 def translate(seq):\n\n     table = {\n        'ATA':'I', 'ATC':'I', 'ATT':'I', 'ATG':'M',\n        'ACA':'T', 'ACC':'T', 'ACG':'T', 'ACT':'T',\n        'AAC':'N', 'AAT':'N', 'AAA':'K', 'AAG':'K',\n        'AGC':'S', 'AGT':'S', 'AGA':'R', 'AGG':'R',                 \n        'CTA':'L', 'CTC':'L', 'CTG':'L', 'CTT':'L',\n        'CCA':'P', 'CCC':'P', 'CCG':'P', 'CCT':'P',\n        'CAC':'H', 'CAT':'H', 'CAA':'Q', 'CAG':'Q',\n        'CGA':'R', 'CGC':'R', 'CGG':'R', 'CGT':'R',\n        'GTA':'V', 'GTC':'V', 'GTG':'V', 'GTT':'V',\n        'GCA':'A', 'GCC':'A', 'GCG':'A', 'GCT':'A',\n        'GAC':'D', 'GAT':'D', 'GAA':'E', 'GAG':'E',\n        'GGA':'G', 'GGC':'G', 'GGG':'G', 'GGT':'G',\n        'TCA':'S', 'TCC':'S', 'TCG':'S', 'TCT':'S',\n        'TTC':'F', 'TTT':'F', 'TTA':'L', 'TTG':'L',\n        'TAC':'Y', 'TAT':'Y', 'TAA':'_', 'TAG':'_',\n        'TGC':'C', 'TGT':'C', 'TGA':'_', 'TGG':'W',\n    }\n    protein =\"\"\n    \n    if len(seq)%3 == 0:\n       \n            for i in range(0, len(seq), 3):\n           \n            codon = seq[i:i + 3]\n            \n            protein+= table[codon]\n   \n    return protein\n\n30 def read_seq(inputfile):\n    \n     with open(inputfile, \"r\") as f:\n        \n         seq = f.read()\n   \n    seq = seq.replace(\"\\n\", \"\")\n   \n    seq = seq.replace(\"\\r\", \"\")\n   \n    return seq\n \nprt = read_seq(\"amino_acid_sequence_original.txt\")\n\ndna = read_seq(\"DNA_sequence_original.txt\")\n \n \np = translate(dna[20:935])\np == prt \nI can't get python to access .txt files for some unknown reason (Likely my lack of knowledge in python).

I would assume that I need to store the information in some way that allows me to search from multiple value - what would be the best way to do this?\n\nDown the road I'd like to make this tool available online (potentially as a backend utility for myself and my employees) - are there any considerations I'd need to take into account for this prior to starting?\n\nI think a nice added feature would be to check quarterly if there have been any modifications to any of the zonings and update accordingly. What would be the best way to do this?\n\nTo get the data I would think using the requests module would work the best for this, then organize it using beautiful soup 4. This part seems fairly straightforward, but what would be the best way to store the data?\n\nOn the surface it feels like a decent project to get started with this stuff, but I know the devil will be in the details here.\n\nI'm jumping in on this head first as it seems manageable, yet challenging enough.

The two inputs of my function are the list and a number of required steps. The function needs to go through the list and count up how many days it took to reach the required number of steps. Below is my code so far which works for the initial part however I need to also add to it so that if the required number of steps is not reached in the input list of tuples, the function returns 'None'. Another thing is that I can only have one return statement because the question states so, which is partially why I am stuck on it.

There's lots and lots of style guides for writing code, but not a lot I can find on arranging it out to be readable, easily deployed and run consistently across multiple systems.

            "selftext": "**Update:** It looks like the reason performance is so bad is because of disk IO limitations. I was mistaken about the resource demands of hashing files. I thought it would be more CPU intensive. But the reason it takes so long to hash large files is because it takes a while to read them from the disk. So it's not appropriate to run 12 simultaneous hashing processes, each trying to read chunks of files from 1 or 2 disks, in most cases. I'll have to use one process per drive, not one process per CPU. This was a good learning experience.\n\nSo I'm trying to hash one file per logical CPU at the same time. The file sizes are keys, and lists of files that match that size are the values. I'm new to multiprocessing, and I'm pretty sure I'm doing it wrong.

I know that my algorithm is inefficient; there are faster ways to look for primes than checking if a number is divisable with any number from an existing list of primes.\n\n2. By \"script slowing down over time\", I'm **NOT** referring to the fact that each prime number check takes longer than the last one because the list of primes is always increasing.\n\nNow, to the problem at-hand; if I were to leave this script running for several hours, or if I put my computer on sleep mode while the script is running and wake it up, the script appears to execute at roughly half the speed it did when I started the script. At first, you'd assume that this has to do with the algorithm itself, of course - *but if I kill the process and restart the script, it keeps counting from where it left off at about double the speed it did before killing it.*\n\n*Does this have something to do with caching? Or perhaps Windows' process prioritisation?*\n\nEDIT: If it matters, the script has currently generated the first 1.3 million prime numbers.",

Sometimes there are two coordinates in an item and the programs prints each location twice (once for each set of coordinates).  What I want to do is remove all of the duplicate asset locations while preserving the sorted list order (I need the closest distance to either set of coordinates, so I can't just use one set or the other).\n\nThe problem is, the text to compare in each returned string is from [13:], but at least we know that all returned strings use that same index.  Those strings are returned as a list.\n\nHow do I compare multiple items in one list using the index [13:] and then remove the second item based on the index [:4] (so as to maintain the closest asset)?\n\nExample:\n\n0.25 miles - Asset Location X (match from coordinate 1)\n\n0.37 miles - Asset Location Y (match from coordinate 2)\n\n1.36 miles - Asset Location Y (match from coordinate 1)\n\n2.39 miles - Asset Location X (match from coordinate 2)\n\nHere, I want to preserve the first two items while removing the second two items based on match the assets' name text.\n\nHere is the full code:\n    \n    def foo():\n        while True:\n            string = get_input(\"Enter data: \", \" \")\n    \n            coords = re.findall(r'\\(([^()]+)\\)', string)\n    \n            for item in coords:\n                try:\n                    float(item[0])\n                except ValueError:\n                    coords.remove(item)\n    \n            print coords\n            print '\\n'\n            f = open('file/path/to/foo.csv')\n            csv_f = csv.reader(f, delimiter=',')\n            for row in csv_f:\n                location = row[0], row[1]\n                for item in coords:\n                    distance = vincenty(item, location).miles\n                    if distance <= 5:\n                        asset = str(row[2])\n                        assetStr = str('{0:.2f}'.format(distance)+' miles - '+asset)\n                        assetLst.append(assetStr)\n                        assetLst.sort()\n    \n            for place in assetLst:\n                print place\n            print string\n            print '\\n'\n\nPlease let me know if that makes sense of you need any clarification in what I'm trying to say.\n\nThanks!\n\nEdit: Grammar",

Then I defined a function called \"interpolation\" that uses this imported data in its calculations.\n\nNow I want to import the function \"interpolation\" in folder2/project.py , so I do: \n*from module import interpolation*\n\nThis works in principle, but the problem is that in order to call \"interpolation\" the data file need also be in folder2.\nSo the error message reads: \n*IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'data.txt'*\n\nIs it possible to work around this, such that the **data file needs only be in folder1, but I still can call the function \"interpolation\"?**\n\nThanks for you help, dear redditors :)\n\n\n**EDIT: I solved this problem by stating the complete path when importing the \"data.txt\" file in module.py .

As a complete noob on programming/webscraping I tried the \"obvious\": send the post method at the URL http://loterias.caixa.gov.br/wps/portal/loterias/landing/megasena.\n\nThe result was: get the last game result every single time. At this point I tried every single URL possible with no success. So I realize when you enter manually a number in that form the site server generates a huge, messy, probably random URL (wich I think is something ralate to session stuff, this is why I used requests.session in my code) for the game result. BOOM! Thats was the correct URL to send the post method.\n\nSo my question is, why the server generates this strangely long URL instead of a rigid one with the game number at the end or something like that.\n\nBTW, as you may have noticed I've used the Requests and BeautifulSoup modules for the job.\n\nThanks and sorry for the bad english and spaghetti code.",

            "selftext": "I wrote a script to find files of duplicate sizes, and then do more stuff which I've omitted. (I did confirm that the code snippet I'm providing experiences the issue I'm posting about.)\n\nNow, I expected this to be bottlenecked by disk I/O. Especially on HDDs, as opposed to SSDs. I'm testing this on two HDDs. Gathering the file size data is maxing out a CPU core and taking longer than expected. My belief is that I've done something wrong with threading, and created an insane amount of overhead. This is my first time using threading.\n\n**UPDATE:** I believe I found the source of the problem. The loop I used to check if there were multiple active threads was apparently the source of the problem. I discovered this by primitive means: I simply ran the script and used CTRL-C to stop it. Each time, the traceback showed it was in the \"if threading.activeCount == 1\" part of the code. I thought that might be looping far too quickly. So I added an else clause with \"sleep(.5)\".

I also know that computers probably run on electricity and magic.

However, is there anything I should look into beforehand? Something in addition to just knowing where the power button on the computer is?

I don't know why I resisted using it, but that's besides the point.\n\nI'd like to share the notebook easily with my boss, he's not a python guy so I don't want him running an instance and loading it himself (he just won't), but I'd like for him to be able to reach my IP/Port and view the same instance I am. We may have the same notebook open concurrently\n\nI'm reading the docs and they say not to do that because:\n\n>If you allow multiple users to access a notebook server as it is described in this document, their commands may collide, clobber and overwrite each other.\n\nSo I'm thinking this doesn't really matter since he won't ever issue a command (unless I'm sitting there issuing it for him, which means I'm not at my computer issuing any that would override one another). \n\nIs there anything I'm missing though? I don't have a ton of time so before I invest a lot to figure out it doesn't work I'd love for someone to point out what I'm missing.\n\nIt seems easy enough, though, to allow listening for specific IP addresses (we're all static at my workplace) and just send him a direct link to it. \n\nThoughts?\n\nEDIT: I did it. It's so easy to do that I figured it was worth looking at. Now he can access it over my IP in the local network and I've included a hashed password to restrict access within the org. \n\nGotta be careful about having it open on multiple machines though - if his is open while I work on it, and then save mine and close out - there's a possibility his could autosave over my changes. \n\nLike I noted above, this isn't really an appropriate solution for multiple users ***at all***, but it solves the ability to get my code-phobic boss to look at the outputs without using the snipping tool and emailing pictures. \n\nI'm still open to any thoughts or criticisms I might have overlooked.

Thanks for any help!\n\nEdit:  If it helps, here's the full function:\n\n    def foo():\n        while True:\n            string = get_input(\"Enter data: \", \" \")\n    \n            coords = re.findall(r'\\(([^()]+)\\)', string)\n    \n            for item in coords:\n                try:\n                    float(item[0])\n                except ValueError:\n                    del coords[0]\n    \n            print coords\n            print '\\n'\n            f = open('[filepath for foo asset csv]')\n            csv_f = csv.reader(f, delimiter=',')\n            for row in csv_f:\n                location = row[0], row[1]\n                for item in coords:\n                    distance = vincenty(item, location).miles\n                    if distance <= 5:\n                        asset = str('{0:.2f}'.format(distance)+' miles - '+str(row[2]))\n                        assetLst.append(asset)\n                        assetLst.sort()\n    \n            for place in assetLst:\n                print place\n            print string\n            print '\\n'\n            del assetLst[:]\n\nEdit 2: I finally figured it out, it was quite simple after all:\n\n    assetLst.append('\\n'+string)\n    pyperclip.copy('\\n'.join(map(str, assetLst)))\n\nThat goes in between lines 29 and 30 above.

I think this has something to do with when I print those in the terminal the text has \\n around the text like this \"\\n\\n\\nGaara's Control Paladin\\nby gaara\\n\\n\"\n\nAny help or at least a shove in the right direction where I can do more research would be great!\n\n\n    import requests\n    from bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n    import csv\n\n\n    page = requests.get(\"http://www.hearthpwn.com/decks?filter-show-standard=1&filter-show-constructed-only=y&filter-deck-tag=1\")\n    soup = BeautifulSoup(page.content, 'html.parser')\n\n    decks = soup.find(id=\"decks\")\n    class_names = decks.select(\".even .col-class\")\n\n    #class_name works\n    class_name = [name.get_text() for name in class_names]\n    #deck_name doesn't work\n    deck_name = [dn.get_text() for dn in decks.select(\".even .col-name\")]\n    #deck_type works\n    deck_type = [dt.get_text() for dt in decks.select(\".even .col-deck-type\")]\n    #ratings doesn't work\n    ratings = [rt.get_text() for rt in decks.select(\".even .col-ratings\")]\n    #views work\n    views = [view.get_text() for view in decks.select(\".even .col-views\")]\n\n     print(ratings)\n\n\n    with open('hearthstone.csv', 'w') as csv_file:\n        csv.writer(csv_file).writerow(deck_name)\n        csv.writer(csv_file).writerow(class_name)\n        csv.writer(csv_file).writerow(deck_type)\n        csv.writer(csv_file).writerow(ratings)\n        csv.writer(csv_file).writerow(views)\n\n    print(\"This is done')",

I'm a noob.\n\n-- All methods are functions, but not all functions are methods. \n\nPython has a built-in library of functions, like int() and abs(). \n\nPython has built-in operations for numeric types, like x + y, but also int()\n\nPython has built-in sequence types, like str, and built-in *string methods* like split(). \n\nQ1: Is there technical difference between numeric type operations and built-in functions? (Since int() seems to be overlapping.)\n\nQ2: Why do sequence types have methods and numeric types have functions? (Are strings technically classes and numeric types are not?)\n\nQ3: At the root of my research, I'm trying to understand why sometimes the argument of a function goes inside the int(x) and sometimes it comes after x.split(). What is the underlying rule here? (I *think* methods are somehow self referencing the argument, but I don't understand...)\n\nThanks! \n",

            "selftext": "I'm trying to solve a python puzzle. Over the past few days I have written about six different scripts attempting to solve this problem, but each time I'm told that my code takes too long to run. I know it must be possible to further optimize my script, but I've hit a bit of a wall. If someone could give me some pointers, I would appreciate it.\n\nProblem to solve: Given two ints `start` and `length`, generate a line `length` units long, starting from the `start` value, and incrementing by one each time. Then generate a second line of `length` units long,  continuing to increment by one from the last value of the previous line, but ignoring the last element of the second line. For the third generated line, ignore the last two elements, and continue ignoring one additional element per line, continuing on until all elements of a line would be ignored.\n\nSo for example if start == 0 and length == 3, I would be looking to capture the digits to the left of the forward slashes (and ignore the digits to the right).\n\n    0 1 2 /\n    3 4 / 5\n    6 / 7 8\n\n(capture 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6)\n\nAfter capturing the correct numbers, we need to figure out the XOR of every captured number. XOR, also known as exclusive or, is performed on the binary representations of our ints, and is easily accessed with the `^` caret symbol. The script should return the XOR resulting from performing XOR on every captured digit, this value will be a single int.\n\nHere is my current script:\n\n    def find_xor(start, length):\n        to_xor = []\n        for minus in xrange(length):\n            for cap_this in xrange(start, start + length - minus):\n                to_xor.append(cap_this)\n                \n            minus += 1\n            start = cap_this + minus\n    \n        return reduce(lambda x,y: x^y, to_xor)\n\nTo explain the last line: reduce takes two inputs, a function and an iterable, and performs the function on the iterable until only one iterator remains. The lambda function I am providing takes two elements and performs XOR (`^`)on them, and the iterable I am using is the list `to_xor`, generated earlier.\n\nI'm not exactly sure where the bottleneck lies, but I suspect that it is either in the nested for-loops, or perhaps something to do with the list appends. The script works, but it's just too slow. Any ideas? Thanks in advance!",

            "selftext": "I have a dictionary where each key has 3 values. I'm trying to print these to a text file with 4 columns...no big deal, right? I can't seem to get the list items to print correctly. It's dumping the correct keys on each line but the same values for the other 3 columns throughout the entire file. My dictionary looks like this:\n\n    {'10.10.0.0/20': ['10.50.0.0/20', '0', '0'],\n     '10.11.0.0/21': ['10.51.0.0/21', '1407', '0'],\n     '10.15.10.0/24': ['10.55.0.0/24', '0', '0'],\n     '10.12.10.0/24': ['10.52.10.0/24', '0', '0'],\n     '10.19.5.0/24': ['10.59.5.0/24', '29852', '7269'],\n    ...\n\nHow can I print this to file with 4 clean columns containing each row of this dict? I've tried several ways, including pickle, and can't get the 3 values to print correctly to the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th columns. \n\n\n**edit:** So after trying several solutions listed here, I realized my entire problem was that one of my keys only had one value, and was missing the counters in fields 2 and 3. I just had to add an if statement checking for len(value) == 1 and insert bogus text into the other 2 fields so they exist. My original simple statement for writing out to the file works now:\n\n    for line, value in dict1.items():\n        outfile.write(line + '\\t' + value[0] + '\\t' + value[1] +  '\\t' + value[2] + '\\n')\n\nI'll go back and try some of the suggested methods to see what gives me the best output.\n\nAlso, someone suggested this:\n\n    try:\n        things\n    except IndexError:\n        other things\n\ninstead of checking for len(value) - I'll try that as well as it seems like a better way to handle the error.

            "selftext": "I feel like this is going to be a really stupid answer, but this is driving me nuts. \n\nI have a script that I am writing that is starting to get up there in size, so I thought I'd try my hand at splitting it into modules. \n\nIn short, my script takes a csv input of product codes, scrapes my wholesaler's website to check the stock on hand level (and a few other metrics) of those products and writes that information to a SQLite db using SQLAlchemy. This bit works. \n\nI am writing a few reports. One that emails me when an item on my monitored list goes out of stock, and another that emails me when a previously out of stock item comes back into stock. The reports work. \n\nWell... they did when they were in the same file as the rest of the script. \n\nI broke the reports into their own file (sm_reporting.py - in the same directory as the main script) as that seemed a logical way to break it up. So I now import the individual functions at the top of the main script using `from sm_reporting import *function names*` (Because import * is naughty). \n\nNow whenever I try and call one of those functions, I get NameErrors for names that are defined in the main script that I am running, but not in the reporting module file (e.g. my SQLAlchemy ORM classes, other modules that I've imported in the main script). I thought because I imported those functions into the main file, that they used names in the namespace of the main file? If I run the main script in the shell and manually call the reporting functions, I also get a NameError, but if I long-hand type out the code of the reporting function I am trying to call, no NameError and it runs fine. \n\nWhat am I missing?\n\nHow do I make the imported functions use the namespace of the main file? I thought it would work like a defined function? I.e. Use a local variable name if it is defined, otherwise look for a global variable?\n\nHelp please. I know this is going to be something dumb that I am missing. \n\nSP\n\nEdit: should clarify, the first reporting function that is failing is just a simple `return session.query(Class).filter(Class.attribute == True).all()` and it is NameErroring at the Class name, which is one of the SQL alchemy orm defined classes. I pass the reporting function the (SQLAlchemy) session as an argument. ",

            "selftext": "So recently I posted about how I'm making a sort of D&D game, where I'm creating a database of items which are linked to a certain class (warrior, wizard, etc) as well as some character properties (strength, intelligence, etc).\n\nSo I have a script that, based on your character, it will go through the database and filter out all the items that match your class and properties, and then simply pick some randomly (because I'll have a shitton of items but every character only gets a few, not a few hundred lol).\n\nHowever, certain items are available to ALL classes. Here's how the items are in my excel file (for now).\n\n* Class  |  Strength  |  Intelligence  |  Item\n* Warrior  |  high  |  Genius  |  Sword\n* Warrior |   high  |  Dumb  |  Club\n* Wizard  |  medium  |  Genius  |  Staff\n* All  |  high  |  Genius  |  Stick\n\nRight now, my algorithm works this way (it's simplified in the example but the principle will be the same):\n\n    # class, strength, intelligence = \"warrior\", \"high\", \"genius\" (only so you guys know what's going on)\n\n    char_properties = {\"warrior\", \"high\", \"genius\"} # set creation\n\n    def set_check(subset, choice_set):\n        if subset.issubset(list(map(lambda x: x.value, choice_set))):\n            return True\n        else:\n            return False\n    \n    def item_matcher(list_of_strings):\n        matching_rows = list(filter(lambda x: set_check(char_properties, x), \n    list_of_strings))\n        matching_items = [item[-1] for item in matching_rows] \n        return matching_items\n\nJust some points in case anyone is wondering:\n\n* I scan my excel file and create a variable that contains all the rows as tuples (that's how openpyxl works)\n* the char properties are in a set because every property will be unique (it's up to me ultimately how I define them)\n* the matching items will be passed into a function that takes random choices (but that's not what is important here)\n\nLet's say I choose the char_properties like in my example. Currently my function will return the Sword, but I also want the Stick to be included. How can I perform a filter to do this? I'm at a loss. I have a few ideas but they seem very unwieldy (like performing two searches, one with your char_properties and one with \"All\" replacing the class, and then adding the two search results together...but that seems inefficient...two searches?).\n\nWhat do you guys think?",

No object of type A is being created, so no process that lasts 10 seconds needs to occur.\n\nHowever, if you were to create a class, B, and set the class variable value to get_value_from_website, different behaviour occurs.\n\n    class B:\n        value = get_value_from_website()\n\nRunning example.py...\n\n    $ python example.py\n    >>> 5 seconds to go until value is returned.\n    >>> 4 seconds to go until value is returned.\n    >>> 3 seconds to go until value is returned.\n    >>> 2 seconds to go until value is returned.\n    >>> 1 seconds to go until value is returned.\n            \n    Process finished with exit code 0\n    \nThis took me a while to track down, because I thought (incorrectly) that all variables attached to classes were calculated when objects were initialised.\n\nI hope this helps someone!

I've tried using `pygame` but can't figure out how so I did a google search and found `msvcrt.getch()`. The only problem with this is when I do `key = ord(getch())` my program pauses until a key is pressed. This is not ideal because I want a live view of the coordinates and then the spacebar adds whatever coordinates are there to a list so I can reference the list when the program is done.\n\nI've tried so many variations of this code that it's full of commented test code and really messy so here's the most important parts in semi-pseudo code:\n\n    x, y = pyautogui.position()\n    if ord(getch()):\n        key = ord(getch())\n    else:\n        key = 0\n\n    if key == 32: # Spacebar\n        coords.append((x,y))\n    elif key == 27: # ESC\n        break\n    else:\n        print(formatted coords)\n\nWhat this is supposed to do is put the coordinates of the cursor as `x` and `y` for the x- and y-coords respectively. Then it checks to see if there is a key input and if there is then `key` becomes the number of whatever key was pressed. If there isn't, `key` becomes `0`. Then it checks the number of the key and does the appropriate action (spacebar adds to the list `coords`, esc breaks out of the `while` loop I have in place, and anything else including `0` should print out the coords formatted to how I want them).\n\nI don't have to have the coordinates printed out but I would like them to be. I've put `key = ord(getch())` first so it's waiting for a key to be pressed and then after that do `x, y = pyautogui.position()` but it gives me a tab/indent spacing error even though I've checked multiple times that all the spacing is 100% correct.\n\nIf anyone has an alternative way to check for a key being pressed but still let the program run please let me know.",

A user suggested the following idea:\nStarting from scratch, the answer can be generated in less than 0.001 second in assembly and probably in other HLL languages. Loading a precalculated table of primes would make it even faster.\n\na) Build the array of primes and keep their sum as it is built; stop when the sum would exceed 1,000,000. (If that last sum would be prime, it would be the ultimate answer; but it is not.)\n\nb) Reduce the number of primes in the sum by 1, first by subtracting the lowest prime (L), then by subtracting the highest prime (H) and check each result for prime.\n\nThen reduce the number of primes in the sum by 2 (2L, 1L1H, 2H).\nThen by 3 (3L, 2L1H, 1L2H, 3H). And so on until the modified sum is the prime = answer.\n\nI tried to write code that follows this, but I it is not woring as intended. \n\n    ub = 1000000\n    def primeSeive (ub):\n    \tub+=1\n    \tarray = [True]*(ub)\n    \tarray[0] = False\n    \tarray[1] = False\n    \tx = 2\n    \twhile(x<ub):\n    \t\tif(array[x] == True):\n    \t\t\tfor a in range (2*x,ub,x):\n    \t\t\t\tarray[a] = False\n    \t\t\tx+=1\n    \t\telse:\n    \t\t\tx+=1\n    \treturn array\n    \n    def isPrime (num):\n    \tif (num <=1 ):\n    \t\treturn False\n    \telif (num == 2 or num == 3):\n    \t\treturn True\n    \telif (num % 2 == 0):\n    \t\treturn False\n    \telse:\n    \t\tub = math.ceil(math.sqrt(num))\n    \t\ti = 3\n    \t\twhile (i <= ub):\n    \t\t\tif(num % i == 0):\n    \t\t\t\treturn False\n    \t\t\ti += 2\n    \t\treturn True\n    \n    primes = []\n    array = primeSeive(ub)\n    for a in range(2,len(array)):\n    \tif(array[a] == True):\n    \t\tprimes.append(a)\n    \n    print(primes)\n    \n    sumConsec = 0\n    i = 0\n    while(sumConsec <= ub):\n    \tsumConsec += primes[i]\n    \ti += 1\n    print(sumConsec)\n    if (isPrime(sumConsec)):\n    \tprint(sumConsec)\n    else:\n    \tlength = i//2\n    \tfor x in range (0, length):\n    \t\tfor y in range (0, x):\n    \t\t\ttemp = sumConsec - sum(primes[0:y]) + sum(primes[x-y:])\n    \t\t\tif(isPrime(temp)):\n    \t\t\t\tprint(temp)\n    \t\t\t\tNone\nNote: I am not keeping track of the terms yet for the 2nd solution. \nHow do I fix my second solution?",

Some methods act on the internal scheduler. Some act in an administrative role like logging. Some pull from the execution environment to communicate with each other.

My issue is I need to run this executable and then run other programs but still be able to communicate to the windows exe\n\nso i was thinking of trying something like this ... but the problem is it opens in the current terminal and won't run the remaining items in the main python script\n\n    def enter_return(program):\n        while True:\n            try:\n                time.sleep(5)\n                program.communicate(input='\\n')\n            except Exception, e:\n                print e\n                main()\n                \n\n    def start_program():\n        try:\n            program = subprocess.Popen([\"C:\\something.exe\",\"--loads\",\"of\",\"--input\",\"arguments\"])\n            print \"started\"\n            thread.start_new(enter_return,(program,))\n        except Exception, e:\n            print e\n        \n\n\nNow I can get it to open in a new window using this, but i'm unable to communicate since it only returns an integer of the call\n\n    def start_miner():\n        print \"starting miner\"\n        try:\n            args = \"start C:\\something.exe --loads of --user arguments\" \n            subprocess.call(args, shell=True)\n            print \"started\"\n        except Exception, e:\n            print e\n\n\nAny idea on how to achieve what I'm trying ? \nEssentially open a windows exe with arguments in a new window and then communicate the return key to that program ",

I'll be making some kind of console application and whenever I've practiced for something like this I've always had problems with formatting and output because especially for the coursework we're not allowed any non-standard libraries or even access to the internet (though I believe we will be allowed to use the documentation that comes with Python thank god) so I don't want to rely on something like curses. So I wanted to ask: what's the easiest way to make a fairly pretty TUI using just the standard lib for Windows?

            "selftext": "I've googled around for my particular problem, and I've come to the conclusion that what I want to do is the wrong thing, but I'd like some confirmation/discussion.\n\nBasically, I have instances of a parent class that contain various instance-specific properties, and I'd like to have a child class that extends the parent class with additional attributes, but is constructed from a specific instance of the parent class, since I want the child instance to have properties from an instance of the parent class.\n\nHere's an example of my thinking. A dealership sells various models of cars (e.g. a Ford dealership selling Fusions, Focuses, and Explorers). For each model of car, there are individual cars in their inventory ready for sale (let's say it's a used-car dealership, so there are individual Ford Focuses of different years and prices). So the parent class represents the car model, and the child class represents a specific car.\n\nSo here's an example parent class.\n\n    class CarModel(object):\n        def __init__(self, model_name, car_type, [...]):\n            self.model_name = model_name\n            self.car_type = car_type\n            # set other attributes\n        \n        # define various methods\n\nSo we might have several instances of `CarModel`, one for each model sold by the dealership. e.g. `focus = CarModel(\"focus\", \"sedan\")`.\n\nNow I'd like to have a child class representing the specific cars at the dealership. I'd like a particular instance of the child class to extend an instance of the parent, `CarModel` class. Something like\n\n    class CarForSale(CarModel):\n        def __init__(self, car_model, model_year, price):\n            self.model_year = model_year\n            self.price = price\n            # inherit the specific properties of the CarModel instance\n            self.model_name = car_model.model_name\n            self.car_type = car_model.car_type\n    \n    # initialize an instance of CarForSale\n    focus = CarModel(\"focus\", \"sedan\")\n    focus2010 = CarForSale(focus, 2010, 10000)\n\nI am wondering, is there a less cumbersome way than to set the attributes one by one? `CarModel` may have a lot of attributes. Something like `CarModel.__init__(car_model)`\n\nPerhaps another way of phrasing my desire is that I'd like instances of `CarModel` to be like \"user-defined types\" that I define specific instances of `CarForSale`s from.\n\nOne alternative solution is to abandon using inheritance and just have `CarOnSale` have a `CarModel` attribute. Would this be a better way to proceed?\n\nPlease let me know where I can clarify things.\n\nOne stack overflow instance of what I am asking is here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35361992/initialise-child-class-with-instance-of-parent-class",

Everything is working well, but I would prefer the temperature to be in Fahrenheit, as well as for both the temperature and humidity to be limited to two decimal places. I don't need to round, a simple truncation would be sufficient. However, I simply don't know where my functions should be inserted. Here's the code:\n        \n    import sys \n    import RPi.GPIO as GPIO \n    from time import sleep \n    import Adafruit_DHT \n    import urllib2 \n    myAPI = \"<your API code here>\" \n    def getSensorData(): \n       RH, T = Adafruit_DHT.read_retry(Adafruit_DHT.DHT22, 23) \n       return (str(RH), str(T)) \n    def main(): \n       print 'starting...' \n       baseURL = 'https://api.thingspeak.com/update?api_key=%s' % myAPI \n       while True: \n           try: \n               RH, T = getSensorData() \n               f = urllib2.urlopen(baseURL + \n                                   \"&field1=%s&field2=%s\" % (RH, T)) \n               print f.read() \n               f.close() \n               sleep(300) #uploads DHT22 sensor values every 5 minutes \n           except: \n               print 'exiting.' \n               break \n    # call main \n    if __name__ == '__main__': \n       main()  \n\nFor the Fahrenheit conversion I would like to insert a formula to take T and convert it using ((T*1.8)+32), and for the rounding/truncating, '{:.4}'.format('T') would be perfect, but again, I simply don't know where to insert this code. \n\nThanks in advance!",

It worked well but everything fell apart when I needed to turn it into an executable file. First cx Freeze wasnt working with Tkinter so I downgraded to Python 3.4 so I could use py2exe. After downgrading I was now running into a  certification error. I googled it and pip installed the correct certification that google maps was missing. So it now worked again in PYcharm. I then used py2exe to turn it into an executable and was succesful however when the executable runs into the google maps section of the program I get:\n\ngooglemaps.exceptions.TransportError: 'Could not find a suitable TLS CA certificate bundle, invalid path: C:\\Python34\\dist\\library.zip\\certifi\\cacert.pem\n\nNow I'v tried googling this my hardest, but have absolutely no idea how to fix it, what certificate to download, or where to even put the certificate before running py2exe so it finds it. Please please help me guys. I'v been scouring the internet for days and have gotten no where. Thank you. \n",

The module is not commented! So any questions/problems/comments/errors ask on. \n    \n  \n**Now an intro:**  \n  \nI've made a color object module in python, in short you can think of it as tuple, generator and dictionary and list - however you please. It can be easily converted to each of it. Currently i am working in R,G,B values so the every conversion described above has max of 3 values until i input an *alpha* to attribute list. I am using convention of 255 max value (1 byte per channel ), also you can use any mathematical and bitwise operator to color object itself. Have in mind, normal color values data type is float, to maximise conversion from True color to Deep color without losing some value, so any integer conversion is and should be done before conversion.    \n  \n*so let's say for example (32,32,32)*  \n  \nI've made an *int* class method so i can generate bit masks from scratch in order to check if some color has cyan, magenta or whatever value - i figured it would be useful later on. Converting to integer works by simple method:  \n  \n    color_integer = (red<<16)+(green<<8)+blue  # if red,green,blue are got from example above  \n  \nTo skip over any issues with *while,for,range,generators and iterators* i've devised a small function that will just return an proportion index of current range(255) and desired range and return the result of an value. This function is mock-up and in first stages of development, so it is kinda simple and perhaps buggy.   \n  \n[here is pastebin of *shift_range_value* function](https://pastebin.com/fP0q3YJN)  \n  \n   \n  \n**Now the issue**  \n  \nI am quite lazy, so i would like to remove the solution to write a bunch of thedious functions that convert and pack color values to specific size. I would like to make a simple function to do it all, so you pass the color and give it number of spaces you need it to fill and *presto* there is a result. I have success in monochrome and grayscale functions for color object, but for full color it is kinda difficult since there is issue of packing each channel separately, like int method but it is not restrained by bit places you need.  \n   \nThe great example of what i need for full color is 8 bit color ( real color ) where in 8 bits said color is represented by RRRGGGBB where red and green can be from 0-8 but blue is from 0 to 4 but as a whole the value is 0-255.  \n  \nSo since we have currently 3 channels ( in future 4) the that full color function needs to comply with is from 3(4) -> infinity. [Here](https://pastebin.com/pAm7M4Yq) is how i envisioned the bit reservation to go. The main issue is i don't know how to generate offset based on max bits and values that need to contain some bits. In short i need to generate precise offset by number of bit places. Anyone have any idea?   \n  \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   \n  \n**EDIT**  \n  \nSuccess !! Finally came to [conclusion](https://pastebin.com/95vuijaC). It is a bunch of simple code, still some revisions required and cleaning up. Any tips on how to clean it up welcomed! :D ",

I do this every single day, it takes me 31 minutes to go through all 52 databases, run the macro, input the dates, close and on to the next.    \n    \nFirst I tried making a batch file, which allowed me to open whichever database I had set the directory to and immediately start running the macro. However I quickly learned the limitations of batch files for even something as simple as this task when I couldn't find any way to use a batch file to input the dates the macro asks for.    \n    \nI have read Automate the Boring Stuff and gone through a Zero to Hero Python course on Udemy. So I have some very basic knowledge of Python syntax.    \n    \nI have searched around Google, github, and stack overflow looking for ways to use Python to do what I want with the databases but most of the things I come across are just ways to implement MS Access databases into Python to be manipulated in a different way.\n\nI just simply want to use Python to open a Microsoft Access database, run my macro, input the dates for me, close the database, and then repeat on the next database.    \n    \nI'm not looking for somebody to write the code for me.

I currently have an assignment that require me to produce a phone bill for a customer using 10 different modules. I am clueless on how to start. I don't even know what to ask. I don't want you to do my homework for me, but I need to have a discussion with someone who knows what they're talking about. \n\nMy teacher seems bothered by my e-mails, and just said that the course does move at a pretty fast pace. I can understand the different expressions & I'm not totally clueless, I just don't know how to apply the different techniques. \n\nPlease help. I came in to this with a background in webdesign & loving code logic, but this is really bringing me down. I feel that if I could just figure out how to start this program, I'd have a \"level-up\" moment & things would click, but I am lost right now. I just stare at a bunch of different Python tutorials and it doesn't seem like anything is actually going to help me with this assignment.\n\nThis is the assignment:\n> In this module you learned about high quality programs. You also began learning about the individual components required to develop a high quality program.\n> Draw a flowchart and pseudocode for a program that produces a monthly bill for a cell phone customer.  \n> List at least 10 separate modules that might be included. \n> For example, one module might calculate the charge for daytime phone minutes used.\n> Make a working version of this program using Python.\n> Complete the flowchart and pseudocode using draw.io. Include your pseudocode by adding a \u201csquare shape\u201d next to your flowchart and populating it with your pseudocode for the program. Export and save your work in PDF format and upload it to the Blackboard assignment area by clicking on the Browse My Computer button below the text editor.\n> Complete the Python code using IDLE. Upload your .py file to the Blackboard assignment area by clicking on the Browse My Computer button below the text editor.\n> This assignment is worth 20 points and will be evaluated using the CIS 129 Assignment Rubric, which is available when you open the assignment.\n> See Schedule for due date.",

I also tried connecting using default gateway but no success. \n\nI am a little confused about it since **Wikipedia** says:\n\n *A default gateway in computer networking is the node that is assumed to know how to forward packets on to other networks. Typically, in a TCP/IP network, nodes such as servers, workstations and network devices each have a defined default route setting, (pointing to the default gateway), defining where to send packets for IP addresses for which they can determine no specific route.*\n\nWhich I understand as it is used to communicate over 2 different networks? Do i use Default Gateway or Public IP?\nAnyways, does anyone know how can I fix this issue and what am I doing wrong?\n\n\n\n\n\n",

By default, if nothing is no flag is used, no \"events\" are schedule, and the program runs by default. Users must give each of the 4 arguments at once for each \"event\", or otherwise there's an error message. Users should be able to schedule as many \"events\" as need be. \n\nAt the moment, I'm not sure of the best way to allow users to pass in argument variables using `argparse`, whereby (1) they can pass in dozens of arguments at once and (2) 4 categories are required. Is this possible? What is the data structure used, a dicitionary via argparse? \n\nFor only one such input, the na\u00efve approach could be to use argparse, and force users to use the following format\n\npython main.py ---user_specify \"category1\", 1233, 1452, 1673\n\nwhereby in the `main.py` script I have something like\n\n\n     import argparse\n     parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()\n     parser.add_argument(\"user_specify\", action=\"store_true\", default=False)\n\n\nThat's quite clumsy. The bigger problem is that it doesn't solve the issue of allowing users to pass through dozens of such arguments. \n\nWhat is the correct pythonic way to do this? \n\nIs it possible to pass through dictionaries?

Then I have races, say human and Elven. Then you choose the general properties that you want according to a rating system 1-5 (i.e. strength 4, magic 3, intelligence 3). Let's just use those 3 to keep things simple.\n\nFinally, there will be a huge database of items that can be filtered down based on the above choices, leaving a few options, which will then be randomly chosen (so you don't always get the same gear even if you choose to be the same character with the same stats).\n\nNow, here's my issue......I don't know how to implement this. \n\nBut maybe if I describe a few more requirements then maybe someone may know exactly what to do. \n\n1. You choose class, race, and stats 1-5 (strength, intelligence, magic).\n\n2. Items are unique to a class and race.\n\nPersonally, I was thinking about having this database in Excel. The first 5 columns state the class, race and 3 stats in that order, with the 6th being the item. Using Python, I then read the Excel file, join the 1st 5 cell values into a list (or set?) and use a search function (if x in y) in Python to extract all the items that would fit the requirements. Then, simply use the random function to choose a few items from these items.\n\nIs this a decent method? Or are there much better ways?",

Now I have only been studying python for 2 weeks now but I thought I would at least be able to come up with say my own version of the rock scissors paper game. I am also only on page 51 in the head first book.... I don't know if I am putting to much pressure on myself and I just need to keep going and actually complete the book before I try and do something on my own?

Do I not need the $? what is the $ for?\n\nAfter some googling, I saw that when in python environment, I don't need to input *python*, so I tried\n\n    setup.py install\n\nthe file is at the same folder as python.

These statements can change the flow of execution of the program.\n\nIn Python, control statement falls under three category:\n\n    Decision Statements.\n    Iteration Statements.\n    Jump Statements.\n\nWe will discuss all the statements in this tutorial with examples.\nDecision statements in Python:\n\nThe first category of control statement is Decision statements. As the name suggests, these statements are for making some decision in our program.\n\nIn, programming when we need to execute some code based upon some condition we can use this control statements. The Decision statement works mainly with two values, one is TRUE, and other is FALSE.\n\nWhen we pass some condition within theses statements, they will evaluate the condition and get one value. Based upon the value some action is taken.\n\nIn Decision making control statements, we mostly use the relational operators and logical operators to create a condition.\n\nPython supports the following Decision statements:\n\n    Single statement suites\n    if statement\n    if\u2026else statement\n    if\u2026else statement\n\nif statement\n\nThe if statement is for executing some statement a set of statements based upon some condition. We have to specify the condition which gives us a boolean value. If the value is true, then the statements are executed else they are ignored.\n\nfor whole tutorial https://t4tutorial.com/python/python-if-else-control-statements/",

Other than that, I figure as long as the amount of files from each directory(after filtering) is the same, all the frames should in theory be matched up properly(ie. frames[0] == [A/image.0001.png, B/image.0001.png, ...]).\n\nI've read that Python is meant to aim for one way of doing things but when it comes to filtering file extensions, there seems to be a variety of approaches from regex, glob, endswith(), pathlib, etc.",

But only to dump data to a new record. Nothing past that. No lookups, no edits, no deletes...  \n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo, before I head any further down the rabbit hole of PYODBC, maybe its best to see what is most prevalent in the community for what I am trying to do. That should help me select my learning path.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\nAdditionally. I chose MSSQL because the express version is free and plenty for what I need to do. I also have access to a SQL BDA at work who is willing to help me out on the SQL side.  \nWhat is your DB of choice? Why? Just curios... \n\n&nbsp;\n\nThank! -jf  ",

            "selftext": "Hi, \n\nFirst time poster here. I have been vectorizing some code and have gotten it to work but I think what I have done isn't very pythonic and would like to see if there are suggestions for a cleaner solution. \n\nBasically, I want to build an `N x M` array `A`. For each row of `A`, I would like to place the values stored in the same row of the array `x` having shape `(N,)` in the column specified in the same row of the array `y` having shape `(N,)`. The elements of `y` range from `0` to `M-1` and index into the columns of `A`. Therefore, each row of `A` will only have a single nonzero element. \n\nHere is what I have:\n\n    A = np.zeros((N,M)) # A has shape (N,M)\n    A[range(N), y] = x # x and y have shape (N,)\n    np.matmul(A,B) # B is some other compatible array\n\nSince I will be using this in a matrix multiplication `np.matmul(A,B)`, it would be great if I could apply `A` inside the call to `matmul` without explicitly instantiating the numpy array and making an assignment, as I have done above. \n\nThere is probably some very obvious way to do this but while I have used Python and NumPy for a while, I have always relied on `for` loops and have just recently started to try and vectorize as much as I can. The equivalent for loop:\n\n    for i in range(N): \n        A(i, y[i])= x[i].\n\nThanks so much\n\nEdit: I have corrected my OP because `x` and `y` have shape `(N,)` and not `(N,1)` as I incorrectly posted originally.",

            "selftext": "I was wondering if anyone had ideas for working as the only coding-inclined person in a group of ~10 coworkers. I am just starting a PhD in a biomedical research group (though I have worked on and off with the group for the past 3 years).  Everyone pretty much just uses basic Excel for daily activities (recording raw data, running basic stats, creating charts), and while it works for them for the most part, I would really like to try making everyone's lives easier by automating some things.\n\nFor example, there is the dreaded \"star and cross hell\", where they run t-tests comparing different treatment groups, then manually add asterisks and plus-signs to the Excel graph to show where significance is achieved. The \"hell\" part is because it's a pretty finicky process and it's hard to get the little text boxes exactly where you want on the graph in the first place, and they don't anchor to the graph so they're easily moved accidentally.\n\nWhen I first started with this group, I wrote a program in R to automate this, but then I learned that it's really hard to trade data back and forth when I'm the only one who uses R without requiring everyone else to learn it too. So now I'm just using Excel, but getting antsy.\n\nMy own Python level is pretty basic - I feel fairly solid about syntax and low-level concepts, but know very little about packages and such. I have a bit of OOP background from previous dabbling in C# and Java.\n\nMy mental image of a program to address the star/cross issue is to have a GUI where users can enter preferences and attach/upload an Excel file, and it will run basic stats (like t-tests) and spit out a pretty graph.\n\nSo, I guess here are my questions: \n-Is it even worth my trying to automate these kinds of tasks in Python? Or should I just try to learn more about macros in Excel?  \n-Does anyone else have experience in a group like this? Did you come up with any cool ideas for boring things you could automate?",

I have created a simple dictionary, and am trying to loop through it and create a few exceptions using an if-elif-else chain.\n\n\nIf I use the following code, the block executes perfectly:\n\n\n    #here is a dictionary of the languages my friends work in\n\n    fav_langs = {\n\t    'malcolm': 'java',\n\t    'tim': 'javascript',\n\t    'troy': 'python',\n\t    'jake': 'c/c++',\n\t    'danny': 'ruby',\n\t    'william': 'perl',\n\t    }\n  \n    # below, the variable n stands for name, \n    # the variable l stands for language\n  \n    for n, l in fav_langs.items():\n        if n == 'troy':\n            print(n.title() + \"'s favorite programming language is \" +\n\t    \t     l.title() + \", but he sucks at it because he's new.\")\n       elif n == 'malcolm':\n            print(n.title() + \" is really good with \" + l.title() +\n\t\t  \", but he also knows like eight other languages.\")\n       else:\n            print(n.title() + \"'s programming language of choice is \" +\n                l.title() + \".\")\n\n\nThis block returns:\n\n\n    Malcolm is really good with Java, but he also knows like eight other languages.\n    Tim's programming language of choice is Javascript.\n    Troy's favorite programming language is Python, but he sucks at it because he's new.\n    Jake's programming language of choice is C/C++.\n    Danny's programming language of choice is Ruby.\n    William's programming language of choice is Perl.\n\n\n\n\nHowever, my book states that if-elif-else chains seek to pass 1 test. If one test evaluates to 'true', then the other tests are skipped. If this is the case, why do both the Malcolm and Troy exceptions pass?\n\n\nThe book states that if I want multiple tests to pass, I should use if-if-else chains. So, if we replace the *elif* n == 'malcolm' line with *if* n == 'malcolm', then the following is returned:\n\n\n    Malcolm is really good with Java, but he also knows like eight other languages.\n    Tim's programming language of choice is Javascript.\n    *Troy's favorite programming language is Python, but he sucks at it because he's new.\n    *Troy's programming language of choice is Python.\n    Jake's programming language of choice is C/C++.\n    Danny's programming language of choice is Ruby.\n    William's programming language of choice is Perl.\n\n\n\nTwo \"Troy\" lines now return, one evaluating to true, the other to false. If what the book says about if-if-else chains is accurate, shouldn't the code simply return one if-statement evaluated to true, and ignore the next if-statement?\n\n\nAlso, could this strange result be caused by the fact that Malcolm comes before Troy in the dictionary, but in the loop, the Troy if-statement comes before the Malcolm if-statement?",

So I have those assignments to do, I've done everything and I've gotten to the last one and for the life of me I can't get it to work. So basically the assignment is this:\n\n*Write a program root.py. in which you will approximate the square root of a number. (Of course there are ways in Python to get the square root of a number directly, but just for fun(?) we will see how it can be approximated otherwise.\n\nSo here\u2019s a way to find the square root of a number (that you may already know of, depending on how much math you know):\n**1. We have a number, let\u2019s call it number\n2. Start with a guess of what the square root of it\nmight be, we can call it guess 3.  Then compute a new guess as number/guess + guess 2\n4. Repeat step 3 a few times \u2013 you\u2019ll get be er and be er guesses!**\nMake a function find_root(number) that does this. As for the initial guess you can start with for example 1. (But if you want to start with something else that\u2019s fine.)\nMake a loop in which you make be er and be er guesses with the formula above. For each time in the loop print how it is going, so that the output looks something like this:\n   \n    >>> find_root(4)\n    After iteration 1 my guess is 2.5\n    After iteration 2 my guess is 2.05\n     ...\n\nand so on. Make at least 5 iterations in the guessing loop, but you can do some more if you want.1\nIs that working  ne? (Test with some low easy num- bers to see that the guesses get closer and closer to the right answer. Otherwise something is wrong.) When it\u2019s working, congratulate yourself before going on!*\n\nWhat I wrote is this:\n\n    number=4\n    guess1=6\n    guess2=5\n    guess3=4,2\n    guess4=2,1\n    newguess=(4/2+2)/2\n    newguess2=(4/5+5)/2\n    newguess3=(4/5+5)/2\n\n    def find_root(n):\n       for i in range(1,6):\n        newguess=guess+2\n        newguess2=guess+1\n        newguess3=guess+0,5\n        print('After iteration', i, 'my guess is', newguess)\n        print('After iteration', i, 'my guess is', newguess2)\n\nAnd what I get iterations with a repeated number. The new guesses, I included them to see if I would get different results based on the formula but it was still the same. So my question is, where am I getting it wrong? I'd like some help, some hints, maybe not the code, so I can do it on my own; but worst comes to worst, I might have to ask for the code lol. This has been doing my head in!\n\nThanks in advance for any help!",

I feel like I'm understanding the info while I'm doing the exercises, but if I put it down for two hours, I feel like I've forgotten everything. So my question(s) is:\n\n- How did you best retain the information you learned when you first started learning the language? Any and all suggestions are welcomed. \n\n- Any tips on preventing letting these lapses from discouraging me? \n\nThanks everyone; this sub has been so helpful. ",

It is taking forever, and I was looking up ways to automate it and ran across Scrapy and Beautiful Soup.\n\nFrom y'alls experience, how feasible is it for a person, who has very, very little python experience to learn to use these toolkits and make a simple script from it? Additionally, which one would you use? I can do 10 hours of work a week, and it would probably be best to finish it in under a month. So 40 hours to make this script. \n\nThe issue is if I fail to make the script in this time-span, I will be stuck doing it manually and will be very behind in data collection.\n\nTo explain the project, it needs to collect the date of when an article was posted from a search result in a specific database. Then it would take those dates and put it into 5 bins: Articles published 1 year after given year X, Articles published 2 years after that given year, etc. \n\nI hope I kept that concise enough, thanks a ton I truly appreciate your time.",

My main objective is to help my IDE with \"intellisense\" and completion.\n\nThe one aspect of the whole type hints is that I don't particularly like the idea of needing to import typing module or any other module where custom types are defined just for the sake of type hints.

Classes are every **Monday 7PM** (Eastern Time), with a total of 4 classes. There will be homework to work in between classes and projects to practice with other people. It's going to be an online class and you'll be able to ask questions and interact with the instructor constantly.\n\nYou can **sign up here: [rmotr.com/free](https://rmotr.com/free-python-online-course)**\n\n### Required knowledge\n\nThis is a course for beginners. Not a lot of knowledge is required. What we always recommend is try to do the free part of codecademy (shouldn't take more than a few days): https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python\n\n### Schedule\n\nAs said before classes will be every Monday from 7M (Eastern Time).\n\n### Questions\n\nPost your comments here or email us at questions@rmotr.com",

This kind of threw me off.  I though JavaScript was a browser based language? Is he recommending that I create a GUI through a browser and have the back-end run via Python?\n\nI would ask him myself but he is currently out of contact for me and I'm hoping to keep this ball of learning rolling. Is this common practice for Python GUI creation or just this persons preference?\n\nEDIT: Quick note.  I started my programming journey with WinForms via C#. Moving to WPF it's now common practice to follow the MVVM design pattern which avoids as much C# as possible. This has driven me away from the Microsoft based programming because I really enjoy C# but not XAML so much... Maybe Visual Studio spoiled me, but the best looking GUI I've gotten from Tkinter was a Win95 looking application.",

Is there some changes I can make to my current code that will make it better, more efficient?

I did get one type working which is below\n\n    num = input('Enter a number: ')\n    length = (len(num))\n    start = 0\n    final = 0\n\n    while (start < length):\n        power = (pow(int(num[start]), int(num[start])))\n        print(power)\n        final += power\n        start = start + 1\n\n    print('Total:',final)\n\nThis asks for a number and does the calculation. What I'm trying to do is start with a number and the code run until the number it starts with equals the number it ends with. What I tried to do was add an additional for loop that would add 1 to the starting number until they matched \n\n    beg = 22\n    num = str(beg)\n    length = (len(num))\n    start = 0\n    final = 0\n\n    while (beg != final):\n        while (start < length):\n            power = (pow(int(num[start]), int(num[start])))\n            final += power\n            start = start + 1\n        print(power)\n        print('Total:', final)\n    \n    beg = beg + 1\n\nAll that seems to happen is the second while loop just runs indefinately as it is not adding 1 to the starting number.

Once selected, the file path is displayed next to the button in an entry widget (I can change this to a label if it will simplify my issue).\n\nMy issue with this is: if the filepath is too long, it gets cut off by the edge of the window and only displays the first part of the path. I'd prefer if it displayed the last part of the path with the actual file name, as I think that's the most relevant part of the path.\n\nI currently don't know how to go about implementing this.

Im going through how to think like a computer scientist right now and im up to the exercises in chapter 3 (question 6 specifically). The problem has you draw a few different polygons using the turtles from the turtle module. \n\nThey just want you to use for loops to draw the shapes, thats no problem however; I wanted to get a little fancy and create a turtle for each of the shapes. I stored them in a list and then tried to have a for loop for each turtle and each draw a different shape. Problem is, when I try to call for a specific turtle from the list, it goes a little whacky. For example, I had one of the loops create a triangle, it works fine if I just iterate through the list as normal. If I try to reference a single turtle however, it will draw three triangles almost in the shape of a triforce lol. \n\nHere is the code:\n\n    import turtle\n    wn = turtle.Screen()\n    frank = turtle.Turtle() # summon the legendary turtle, frank the destroyer\n    tess = turtle.Turtle() # summon tess, not as cool as frank\n    roy = turtle.Turtle() # franks younger stronger yet, less couragous brother\n    phineas = turtle.Turtle() # total bitch\n    turtles = [frank, tess, roy, phineas]\n\n    for tess in turtles:       #draw an equilateral triangle\n        turtle.forward(50)\n        turtle.left(120)\n        turtle.forward(50)\n        turtle.left(120)\n        turtle.forward(50)\n\n\n\n\n    wn.mainloop()",

It seems like it is a cottage industry to launch fancy websites proclaiming how amazing a company's python online training is.\n\nI am a lab PI that has a lot of new trainees coming into the lab frequently. I personally know and use python, and learned on my own. We used to have new lab trainees take a class in the computer science department at my university. With recent increases in tuition, non-degree seeking students (e.g. a post-doc) are charged a lot more for the python course (like $5k total!) than a regular undergrad. So I am looking for alternatives - an online python course oriented toward python basics aimed at bioinformatics and data science. My lab uses python, pandas and many packages in anaconda. We are also in the midst of transitioning our perl code bases to python, and transferring our R-based machine learning code bases to python as well. Thus, we need to get new trainees a base line ability with python so they can learn things specific to our research program.\n\nPaid courses are not a problem as long as the cost is reasonable. Certification is not the goal, skills are the goal, so paying for a \"certification\" in addition to the tuition is not needed. What is needed, is a high quality, on-demand course that new lab trainees can take to get going with python quickly. I have pointed new trainees to \"Automate the Boring Stuff\", but some sort of interactive online course would help, especially for the biologists that need encouragement to learn to program.\n\nLet me know your suggestions, they would be much appreciated.",

However if I print them using the function, the function returns none, or complains that it returns none and not a string. If I take away the function args, and the function, and just do it straight up it works fine.  Why do I get None back as what was copied? I added a way of printing what the scraper function was doing, and it's working like it should.  So I think the problem lies with my printer function.  I used the file opening and writing scheme from Python to print, and other than trying to print the output of a function I can't think of anything else that might be going wrong. Is it possible to print the output of a function to a txt file in Python? I can paste the code if needed. ",

Right now I'm practicing making a budget application and am stuck on which part of my application should read a file and which part should be create objects.  So far my program looks like this:\n\n    Project/\n    Project/main.py\n    Project/modules/\n    Project/modules/transaction.py\n    Project/modules/account.py\n    Project/modules/file_read.py\n    Project/modules/__init__.py\n\nmain.py is my testing playground and is calling and printing to test that everything works.  main.py is calling file_read.py which reads a .csv file of bank transactions and returns a list of dictionaries using the `csv` module from the standard library.  Now if this were the final build of the program should main.py actually be the one calling file_read.py or should this be handled by the account.py or another class?  Also, as file_read is using the `csv` library which is creating a dictionary from the .csv file, which I place into a list, should the file_read.py be converting each dictionary into a transaction class or is it okay for it to return the list?  Finally, if we're okay returning the list back to main.py should main.py convert the list into transactions and pass that to account.py or should account create the transactions?  I'm currently trying to Google answers but haven't found relevant examples.  Thanks in advance for any feedback.",

It's all clear, except for one thing, that is I would like my data (e.g. workers or gear and their values like name, surname, dates of assignments etc.) to be displayed in a listbox with columns, basically [something like this](http://software-solutions-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/multicolumn-listbox-vba1.png).\n\nI'd like to do it with `tkinter` mainly because I'm most familiar with it. However, there's a problem because `tk.Listbox` does not support columns! I tried to Google the solutions extensively and try them for myself, but so far I have only found two somewhat (but not really) viable solutions. \n\n\nFirst one is [this](https://pyinmyeye.blogspot.com/2012/07/tkinter-multi-column-list-demo.html) which somewhat worked for me (it was not wrong in its core design) but since it's just modified `ttk.Treeview`, I had some problems with implementation and documentation on this widget is quite scarce so I have no idea if it does what I need.\n\n\nAnd second one is [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5286093/display-listbox-with-columns-using-tkinter) which was the most promising so far since it's an actual Tcl widget. However (probably due to its age - last modified in 2006) even after proper installation (both `tkinter` addon and `Tcl` packgage) it gives me random errors all the time and some methods don't seem to work (e.g. `.get` - I can post tracebacks). \n\n\nSo now, here's my question - what's the best way to do it?

However, I noticed an error, but I already turned it in, so it's too late now. I added an improper = to on the second statement for each R and B. But, it ended up working fine, because even if it ran the second line by typing 8000 or 10000, the equation in my elif statements made the results the same.

            "selftext": "HI there! \n\nI purchased the book Make your own neural network by tariq Rashid. I highly recommend it if you like me you have almost no programming experience and want to have an intro to neural networks.\n\nNow the way the book is structured is that we learn pieces of codes and learn what they mean step by step.  From time to time Tariq puts all these pieces of code together in a summary. \n\nI have just arrived to another code summary and there are differences between my code and his. I have some questions as to why my code differs from his. \n\nHere is my [full code](https://www.pastiebin.com/59ad463b430a1).\n\n\n\n**Question 1:**\n\n\nIn the initialisation section of the class neuralNetwork we define the variables self.inodes, self.hnodes, self.onodes. Why is that?\n\n    def __init__(self, inputnodes, hiddennodes, outputnodes, learningrate):\n            #set number of nodes in each input, hidden, output layer:\n            self.inodes = inputnodes #why can't we immediately use the inputnodes?\n            self.hnodes = hiddennodes\n            self.onodes = outputnodes\n    \n\nThe only place where they are being referrenced in the code is when we link the weights  with their respective nodes, like so:\n\n     self.wih = np.random.normal(0.0, pow(self.hnodes, -0.5),(self.hnodes,self.inodes))\n     self.who = np.random.normal(0.0, pow(self.onodes, -0.5),(self.onodes, self.hnodes))   \n\nCouldn't we have written the following? Even if it works, is there a bigger picture reason why this isn't recommended?\n    \n     self.wih = np.random.normal(0.0, pow(hiddennodes, -0.5),(hiddennodes,inputnodes))\n     self.who = np.random.normal(0.0, pow(outputnodes, -0.5),(outputnodes, hiddennodes))    \n\n\n**Question 2:**\n\n\nWe now wish to train the neural network to do OCR. we first load the mnist training data file into a list. As I understand, in the first line we open the file, we then read the lines from the data. When we're done we close it to save memory.\n\n    #Load the mnist training data CSV file into a list\n    training_data_file = open(\"C:/Users/delah/Jupyter/mnist_train_100.csv\", 'r')\n    training_data_list = training_data_file.readlines()\n    training_data_file.close()\n    \n\n We then go on to write this code, with which I have two issues. \nFirst how can we split the data specified  in the \"all_values\" variable if we just closed the training data using training_data_file.close()?\n\nSecond, in the book tariq writes: all_values = record.split(\",\") . However we have never specified a \"record\" variable before. \n\n    #Train the neural network\n    \n    #Go through all the records of in the training dataset for record in the  training_data_list:\n    #Split the records by \",\"\n    all_values = training_data_list[0].split(\",\")\n    #scale and shift inputs\n    inputs = ((numpy.asfarray(all_values[1:])/ 255.0 * 0.99) + 0.01)\n    #create the target output values (all 0.01, except the desired label which is 0.99)\n    targets = np.zeros(output_nodes) + 0.01\n\n\nMy code is otherwise identical to the code provided, but it still won't run. I'm kind of stuck because, before this summary, my code would always run neatly. Not sure what i'm doing wrong otherwise. It looks like I have two simultaneous errors. How is that possible? Isn't the first error usually reported? Why did it first report the error on line 104 and then the one on 52? Does it run the code from top to bottom?\n    \n    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)\n    <ipython-input-35-699c67623a99> in <module>()\n        102 # all_values[0] is the target label for this record\n        103 targets[int(all_values[0])] = 0.99\n    --> 104 n.train(inputs, targets)\n    \n    <ipython-input-35-699c67623a99> in train(self, inputs_list, targets_list)\n         50 \n         51         #update the links between the hidden and the final output layers\n    ---> 52         self.who += self.lr * numpy.dot((output_errors * final_outputs * (1.0 - final_outputs)), numpy.transpose(hidden_outputs))\n         53         self.wih += self.lr * numpy.dot((hidden_errors * hidden_outputs * (1.0 - hidden_outputs)), numpy.transpose(inputs))\n         54         pass\n    \n    ValueError: shapes (10,10) and (100,) not aligned: 10 (dim 1) != 100 (dim 0)\n    \n\nThanks in advance for your time. I've only now gotten really stuck in the book. Seems like i'm stuck in a few places and don't know how to keep going.",

So, if you can help me I would really appreciate it. here is my bash code:\n\n    for i in {1..254}; do\n       if out=$(ping -c 1 192.168.1.$i); then\n       echo \"$out\" | grep \"^---\" | cut -f2 -d' '\n    fi\n    done\n\nand here is my python code which I developed so far which might be completely wrong. \n\n    #! /usr/bin/python\n\n    import subprocess\n    import os\n    import multiprocessing\n\n    for x in range(1,254):\n    ping -c 1 -w 1 192.168.1.x \n\nso it does give me an error now. can you guys tell me what I am doing wrong with the x being there? Thanks!",

I notice, however, that if I make a folder name the argument for **os.path.getsize()**, it does not seem to return the size of the folder, including all of its contents.\n\n(Example, when I enter:\n\n    >>>os.path.getsize('/Users/*myname*/Documents') \n\nit returns with: \n\n    1088\n\nWhen I check the size of my Documents folder in the Finder, it tells me its 58.77GB... quite a deal more than 1088 bytes.\n\nWhy is this?\n\n(All of the above is on a Mac... if that makes any difference. Its made this chapter a little frustrating, trying to translate his examples from Windows file structures and formatting to Mac...)",

The db.create_all() function does this:\n\n    (venv) $ python hello.py shell\n    >>> from hello import db\n    >>> db.create_all()\n\n--\n\nHowever, when I run \"python hello.py shell\" in terminal (with virtual environment activated), it simply takes me back to (venv) $, leaving no place to input the additional code (\"from hello import db\", etc.) . I also tried using the python3 command. \n\nHere is the sequence of events: \n--\n    \n    (venv) My-MacBook-Pro:flasky user$ python3 hello.py shell\n    (venv) My-MacBook-Pro:flasky user$ \n\n--\n\nInstead of doing (venv) $ python hello.py shell, I just typed python3, which allows me to input code to create tables, insert rows, etc.  This also created the data.sqlite file in the application directory, so I thought it was the solution. \n\nHowever, later in the chapter he writes,\n--\nThe make_shell_context() function registers the application and database instances\nand the models so that they are automatically imported into the shell:\n\n    $ python hello.py shell\n    >>> app\n    <Flask 'app'>\n    >>> db\n    <SQLAlchemy engine='sqlite:////home/flask/flasky/data.sqlite'>\n    >>> User\n    <class 'app.User'>\n\n--\n\nLike before, when I input, \"python3 hello.py shell\", doesn't give me >>> for additional code.  When I input \"python3\", I can input python code, but >>> app returns \"app not defined\" \n\nI'll try to summarize: \n\n-What is the \"shell\" command in terminal supposed to do (I couldn't find anything on this)\n\n-Am I interpreting the book instructions incorrectly when I read, \"python hello.py shell\" as something I should input in terminal?\n\n-The general purpose here is to be able to create a database (done), add users to the database via the web application (done), and be able to query the database contents later, after closing and re-opening the virtual environment (totally lost) \n\nApologies for the long post- any help is much appreciated.

I'm 15 so I can't really get a job with my sub-par Python skills yet (although if anyone has \n a part-time beginner/intermediate remote position/internship hmu I really need some cash) and I'm wondering what fun things I can do with Python.\n\nFor example, I'm working on a script with `pyautogui` that can complete [The Impossible Quiz](http://www.theimpossiblequiz.net/impossiblequiz.html) automatically and I'm currently at question 80 in about a minute and a half.\n\nThe other day I wrote a script that would automatically submit random survey results with `pyautogui` that would monitor itself while it run and if something went wrong it would close Chrome and re-open it to the survey website and continue submitting. Once I ended the program it would text me the number of surveys it submitted.\n\nI'm just looking for fun projects or things in general that I can do so I'm not completely wasting my free time. If it happens to help me in the future by teaching me skills that I'll need then that's an added bonus. I do have an RPi 3B and an RPi 0W so I can use those some too. I'm good with challenges and I don't mind teaching myself more.

I keep finding threads on stackexchange that say all you have to do is add a blank `__init__.py` file to the subdirectory which I'm doing but I keep getting these Import errors. The fact that it works in the python shell is the worst part because I don't know why it works there but not in my actual script. \n\nWhat am I doing wrong? \n\nEDIT: I uploaded a example project to github that might be easier to show what I'm doing. In the project I have two lines for two custom modules: \n\n    from .subdir.hellosubdir import HelloSubdir\n    from .hellosamedir import HelloSamedir\n\nAs it is now it give the error:\n\n    from .subdir.hellosubdir import HelloSubdir\n    ImportError: No module named 'helloimports.subdir'\n\nIf I comment out that line the line `from .subdir.hellosubdir import HelloSubdir` the other line imports without any problems. \n\nHere's the github link:\n\nhttps://github.com/thetalentedmrpeanut/helloimports\n\nAlso I'm installing this via pip and running it via cli with the `$ helloimports` command\n\nEDIT 2:\n\nOk so I think I'm starting to wrap my brain around this. Here's what I found after some more digging:\n\nFirst I looked up exactly where pip is installing my projects after I run the command `$ pip install --user projectname/`. I did this by opening a python shell and runing the following commands:\n\n    >>> import sys\n    >>> sys.path\n\nBecause I'm installing these packages with the `--user` flag a per the instructions of my operating system (gentoo linux) these packages are being installed in `/home/myusername/.local/lib64/python3.4/site-packages/` \n\nWhen I went into that directory and then into the `helloimports` directory I discovered that my `subdir` directory was not even being installed. I did some more research and I think a big part of my misunderstanding has to do with the terms and how python defines certain things. As I understand it now a PACKAGE is a directory that contains a `__init__.py` file, a MODULE is a file with a `.py` extension that contains python code. Then there's also PROJECT which I'm going to think of as the entire collection of files. \n\nThe confusing thing about PACKAGE is that it's different than how a linux distribution would define a package. So on my system the package that gets installed is what I refer to as the PROJECT. \n\nSo one issue was that in my mind placing a module into a sub directory was just a matter of keeping multiple modules organized. I wasn't thinking that the act of placing them inside a sub directory was in fact creating a PACKAGE. I thought that a sub directory with a blank `__init.__py` was the same thing as having that module file in the same directory. \n\nSo I needed to find out why `subdir` was not being installed and I found out that the problem was in my `setup.py` file. In that file \nI had the line `packages=['helloimports'],` \n\nIn my mind thinking that my `subdir` was part of the `helloimports` package I thought that it should just automatically be included. But now that I know that the act of creating a subdirectory creates package it makes sense that it would not be installed. \n\nTo install the `subdir` package I can either explicitly add like: `package=['helloimports', 'subdir']` or I can import the `find_packages` function from `setuptools` and then change the line to `package=find_packages()` this will automatically add all the sub packages within the main package unless you pass an argument excluding certain ones etc.\n\nSo the summary for the issue of importing sub directories is:\n\n1\\. if you place a module in a sub directory it is no longer just a module it is now a PACKAGE\n\n2\\. This new sub directory PACKAGE must contain an `__init__.py` file. This file can be blank or it can have code in it depending on your preference. \n\n3\\. In `setup.py` you must either explicity add the subdirectory name to the `setup()` `package=` argument or you must import the `find_packages` function with `from setuptools import setup, find_packages` and then set `packages=find_packages()`\n\n4\\. In the main file for you PROJECT if you want to import the sub directory module you use the dot notation like: `from .subdirectory.modulename import ClassName`  \n\nNext I discovered that my `bin/helloimports` file was not even doing anything. I removed it completely from the project and and my commandline command of `$ helloimports --print-hello-subdir` still worked. I looked at what `pip` was actual installing in the directory `.local/bin` and that was the following code:\n\n    #!/usr/bin/python3.4\n    # EASY-INSTALL-ENTRY-SCRIPT: 'helloimports==0.1.0','console_scripts','helloimports'\n    __requires__ = 'helloimports==0.1.0'\n    import re\n    import sys\n    from pkg_resources import load_entry_point\n\n    if __name__ == '__main__':\n        sys.argv[0] = re.sub(r'(-script\\.pyw?|\\.exe)?$', '', sys.argv[0])\n        sys.exit(\n            load_entry_point('helloimports==0.1.0', 'console_scripts', 'helloimports')()\n        )\n\nThis didn't look anything like the `bin/helloimports` file that I had written. My bin/helloimports script was:\n\n    #!/usr/bin/env python\n    \n    import helloimports\n    helloimports.helloimports.main()\n\nBut as it turns out I could have written anything in that file because it wasn't even being used. Again this was an issue with my understanding of `setup.py`. I had previously been using the `setup()` parameter `scripts=` for my python projects projects. So in past 2.7 projects I was doing something like `scripts=['bin/helloimports'],` in `setup()` in `setup.py`. \n\nIn new python 3 projects I've still been creating these `bin/projectname` scripts but I've been using the `entry_points=` parameter. I for some reason was thinking that this was interacting with my `bin/projectname` file but I have learned that it is not. And I also learned that it's much more powerful than I thought and you can, I think, create command line executables that target just a single function within a module. \n\nSo when I had the following in `setup()` in `setup.py`:\n\n    entry_points={ \n        'console_scripts': [\n            'helloimports=helloimports.helloimports:main',\n        ],\n    },\n\nIt had nothing to do with my `bin/helloimports` file. Instead it's defining the cli executable as `helloimports` and setting that equal to main package name `helloimports` --> main module name `helloimports.py` --> function of `main()`\n\nThis also means that the code in my `helloimports/__init__.py` file wasn't really doing anything either. I had it as \n\n`helloimports/__init__.py`:\n\n    import helloimports\n\nI don't think this was doing anything at all. Or at least it wasn't doing what I thought it was. If I delete that line and have a completely blank `__init__.py` file the commandline executable still works because I'm explicity connecting the main module of `helloimports.py` in the chain. \n\nSo how I understand it now is that the line `helloimports=helloimports.helloimports:main` can be broken down into the following parts:\n\n1\\. `helloimports=` is the commandline executable that is used when running `$ helloimports --help` etc. \n\n2\\. `helloimports.` is the helloimports package which is the `helloimports/__init__.py` file. \n\n3\\. `.helloimports` is the `helloimports/helloimports.py` file\n\n4\\. `.helloimports:main` is the `def main():` function in `helloimports/helloimports.py` \n\nSo the issue comes into how to deal with these `__init__.py` files. From my understanding I can do a couple of different things. \n\n1\\. I can leave the `__init__.py` file blank. This creates the need for the chaining of the blank `helloimports/__init__.py` to the `helloimports.py` in the `console_scripts` in `setup.py`. `helloimports.helloimports:main` \n\n2\\. I can place all the code for my main module `helloimports.py` in `__init__.py`. Then my project would change from:\n\n    helloimports/\n    ---- __init__.py\n    ---- helloimports.py\n\nto:\n\n    helloimports/\n    ----__init__.py\n\nAnd this would change the `console_scripts` to `helloimports=helloimports:main'\n\n3\\. I can add some code to `__init__.py` to import everything from the `helloimports.py` module into the `__init__py` file and in doing so let the main PACKAGE and main MODULE be the same thing in the eyes of python. So this would look like:\n\n    helloimports/\n    ---- __init__.py\n    ---- helloimports.py\n\nAnd `helloimports/__init__.py` would have the line `from .helloimports import *`\n\nThis would also be a situation where `console_scripts` in `setup.py` looks like `helloimports=helloimports:main` \n\nPersonally I perfer to have my main module file named the same as the package and I don't like putting tons of code in `__init__.py` but I also see the argument that the execessive chaining with the same name can get confusing. So I think I will try the #3 approach for now unless someone can prove to me that placing all your code in `__init__.py` is better. I would much rather think of `__init__.py` as being a simple file that defines a package not as being the file that contains all the code. If i'm searching for the main code in a python project it makes more sense to me to open up a `projectname.py` file than a `__init__.py` file that could technically be blank. \n\ntl;dr - It's working for me now, I am still potentially violating best practices but at least now I can directly break or fix the imports in a way that makes sense to me. I've uploaded the new version of the project as a separate repo here so that it's easy to see the changes between the 2 versions:\n\nhttps://github.com/thetalentedmrpeanut/helloimports2\n",

What is the best way to do it, and how would it be done (what does it look like?) \n\nRight now, I have a directory: c:/users/me/pyCharmProjects/myModules/steven_tools\n\nWithin that, I have several .py files, small little tools that use other built-in tools to make it do more or specific things. Also, in the 'myModules' folder, I have the __init__.py file (which is blank)\n\nSo, do I need an __init__.py file in the 'stevens_tools' directory as well? How do you handle dependencies from modules importing other modules/packages? I.e. I have some tools that use the 'os' or 'bs4' (beautiful soup) package. \n\nHow can I always ensure that my modules will work? Do I need to do anything in the __init__.py files? (like, list the dependencies/modules/imports/packages/etc) \n\nHoping for a very clear, concise, and understandable reply(s). I'm able to do the imports or my stuff, but sometimes they break, or I have to fiddle with them.. I want to make sure I'm doing everything 'correct' and by the proverbial book, but sometimes the technical documents and documentation can be difficult to fully understand. And 'knowing' is not good enough, it is key to 'understand!' :D\n\nThank you! \n\nEDIT: Oh, and also about auto documentation. I mean, I know that the triple ' will create auto-docs when you import, but is there anything else? \n\nAlso wanted to say that it's been a while since I wrote larger programs. I usually just write little one-off tests and small programs to do x, y, or z. I used to do this in c, but I haven't written in c in years, and not even sure it's the same exact concept (I think the concept is basically the same, but implementation is not exact..) \n",

Here is the Complete question: \n> The academic office at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry has compiled data about students' grades. The data is provided as text from standard input in three parts: information about courses, information about students and information about grades. Each part has a specific line format, described below..\n\n> Information about courses\nLine format: Course Code~Course Name~Semester~Year~Instructor\nInformation about students\nLine format: Roll Number~Full Name\nInformation about grades\nLine format: Course Code~Semester~Year~Roll Number~Grade\nThe possible grades are A, AB, B, BC, C, CD, D with corresponding grade points 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5 and 4. The grade point average of a student is the sum of his/her grade points divided by the number of courses. For instance, if a student has taken two courses with grades A and C, the grade point average is 8.50 = (10+7)\u00f72. If a student has not completed any courses, the grade point average is defined to be 0.\n\n> You may assume that the data is internally consistent. For every grade, there is a corresponding course code and roll number in the input data.\n\n> Each section of the input starts with a line containing a single keyword. The first section begins with a line containing Courses. The second section begins with a line containing Students. The third section begins with a line containing Grades. The end of the input is marked by a line containing EndOfInput.\n\n> Write a Python program to read the data as described above and print out a line listing the grade point average for each student in the following format:\n\n> Roll Number~Full Name~Grade Point Average\nYour output should be sorted by Roll Number.

Sometimes there are more than one work under one creator heading, separated by an empty line. The creator name and website are made bold and offset by empty lines.\n\nI have looked at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19437207/python-parsing-structured-text-to-csv-format (etc), but all those and related have definite structures that always have all fields and have text-only indicators for certain \"title\" fields.\n\nIt is currently a LibreOffice document (originally Word). Perhaps I can export as HTML, which would make the headings a different parsable tag...\n\nIdeally there exists a library that already has related useful capabilities, but I am willing to do some work.\n\nThis is my time trying to write a parsing script for something variably formatted, so I appreciate all help. Thanks!\n\n(Using Linux, Python 3.6.2)\n\n[edit 1] There is a colon after each field name; the dates are just the years; website starts with www. The field names vary, for example length, commissioned by, dedicated to, etc. If all info could just first be parsed as strings, that would be a start, but I realize that the above information can be used to identify fields...\n\n[edit 2] A sample of the data: https://pastebin.com/EYeuBLgV\nI also see now that the formatting with tabs are not consistent, but hopefully that can be trimmed away. What might pose an additional problem is that in certain cases the data field on the right \"wraps\" to a new line that is manually indented with tabs again, but forms part of the previous line.\n\n[edit 3] Data sample in .docx format: [link removed]\n\n[edit 4] I used u/Justinsaccount's script, which worked excellently! I just tweaked a few things and wrote the result to csv.",

            "selftext": "Edit 3: Question answered sort of. I uninstalled 32-bit and reinstalled 64-bit python and that gave me the memory flexibility I needed to no longer get MemoryError at N = 12. I first tried memoization because I misunderstood it for saving memory, but it turns out it only saves time, not space, so I killed it. Final run time for N = 12 is around 5 min.\n\nEdit 2: Question has evolved - I am unable to calculate TSP for N=12 because I keep getting a MemoryError. Any advice on how to avoid this?\n\nEdit 1: Problem solved with the following function, though the performance increase isn't what I anticipated:\n\n    def find_min_route_brute_force2(self):\n        all_routes = [list(perm) for perm in list(permutations(self.coord_list))]\n        for perm in all_routes:\n            perm.insert(0, self.start_point)\n            perm.append(self.start_point)\n        self.min_route = min(all_routes, key=self.total_route_distance)\n        self.draw_shortest_path()\n        return\n\nHi all, this is my first project in python (I have other programming experience) and I'm trying to do a brute-force solution to the travelling salesman problem. The code below seems to work, but I think it's running in O((N+1)!) when I believe it can run in O((N-1)!). The difference in practicality for larger applications is not that much, since neither have any use beyond N=14 or so, and my only goal is to run up to N=12 in reasonable time. Running N=11 took about 3-4 minutes and I believe N=12 will take close to an hour if I don't optimize a little.\n\nIn the code below, self.coord_list is simple a list of tuples, with the first coord appended onto the end of the list, because the  An example of coord_list for N = 6 is \n\n    [(30.147059, 79.746835), (45.996732, 78.270042), (61.19281, 78.270042), (60.04902, 48.734177), (43.545752, 49.156118), (30.228758, 51.476793), (30.147059, 79.746835)]\n\nYou'll note there are 7 coordinates, with one being repeated (the start/end point). My workhorse method is below, and makes use of list comprehensions to get the min and then plot it on my GUI. You'll notice I employ the itertools.permutations method in a list comprehension and only compare minimums for places where the self.start_point is at the beginning and end of the permutation. This is where I believe my inefficiency is, and I think it stems from my misunderstanding of how to properly use either itertools.permutations or list comprehensions. \n\nOptimally, I think it makes the most sense to not include the starting or end point in the permutation calculation, but instead generate permutations for everything but, then add the start/end point in before I do any distance calculations (because the start_point is specified and permutations without it are ignored anyways). This should, in theory, reduce the total number of permutations generated from N+1! to N-1!. Here's the code as it stands:\n\n    def find_min_route_brute_force(self):\n\n        self.min_route = min([perm for perm in permutations(self.coord_list)\n                              if perm[0] == self.start_point and perm[len(self.coord_list) - 1] == self.start_point],\n                             key=self.total_route_distance)\n        self.draw_shortest_path()\n        return\n\nThe problem I'm running into is that I have no idea how to actually do this. I've tried using the following, which doesn't work and probably highlights my misunderstanding of either permutations or list comprehensions:\n\n    permutations(self.coord_list).append(self.start_point) #itertools.permutations object has no attribute 'append'\n    perm.append(self.start_point) #TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not iterable\n\nI'm feeling kinda stuck and I'm pretty sure I'm just making some kind of dumb mistake here. Please let me know if you have any suggestions. I can post more code if needed, but really this seems like something an understanding of syntax would help. Thanks!\n    ",

The following is the current code that uses a GET for each coin\nMy end goal is to use 1 get.  \n  \n    URL = \"https://api.coinmarketcap.com/v1/ticker/\"\n    coinData = requests.get(URL).json()\n\nCurrent Code Below\n\n    import requests\n    import json\n\n    coins = {\"ethereum\":1.8387, \"bitcoin\":.1, \"litecoin\":6, \"monero\":3, \"siacoin\":7,\"omisego\":1.168,\"golem-network-tokens\":7,\"ripple\":4,\"digibyte\":18,\"neo\":1.251,\"bytecoin-bcn\":20, \"signatum\":1}\n    coinStats = []\n    totalStats = []\n    totalCoinValue = 0.0\n\n    for coin in coins:\n        URL = \"https://api.coinmarketcap.com/v1/ticker/\" + coin\n        data = requests.get(URL).json()\n        name = data[0][\"name\"]\n        price = format(float(data[0][\"price_usd\"]), '.2f')\n       \n        currentPrice = (float(price) * coins[coin])\n        coinStats.append({name:price})\n        totalStats.append({name:format(currentPrice, '.2f')})\n        totalCoinValue += currentPrice\n\n    #print(coins[\"monero\"])\n    print(coinStats)\n    print(totalStats)\n    print(format(totalCoinValue, '.2f'))\n    print(json.dumps(coinStats, indent=1))\n  \nany help would be great ",

I'm kind of confused as to how exactly to implement it however.\n\nI have cloned the `export` branch on the repo into my project folder.  The root folder is called `python-overpy`, and the scripts themselves are found in a subfolder called `overpy`, which has an `__init__.py` file.  I think I should just be able to say from `python-overpy import overpy` and then be able to start using it, but I get a red line and it says that the library is not found.  Am I doing this wrong?\n\nAnd once I get it working, would I call this `dump()` method with something like `overpy.dump(params)`?\n\nI feel like I am in very much uncharted waters, I have never worked on a project with experimental branches from other projects before.",

Even with teacher guidance I am unable to do much. It's absolutely devastating for me because all I currently feel is that I'm an absolute idiot and I feel like I'm merely failing in my course. I do know some concepts and I believe that I know them well in theory but when it comes to application, I'm lost. I also fail to understand what exactly to do in our assignments even after asking the teacher. I feel like my problem is a comprehension problem but how exactly do you manage to get around a comprehension problem.\n\nIf anyone can suggest anything I can do to sort of improve, I wanted to take some python course and I did take a recommended one but the workload is so intense in university that by the time I reach a certain point in the course, the class is far far ahead and it all feels like it's a waste. \n\nI'm posting here because I hope someone can tell me where I'm going wrong or what I'm doing wrong.

Anyway I'll end up needing probably less that 100 columns of data, about 90% of it optional.  My question is am I better to:\n\nA.) hard code the columns: IP address goes in Column \"A\", interface name in \"B\", serial number goes in \"C\", Model goes in \"D\".  With this I am sure it works right every time, but if I need to stick something in the middle than I have to re-letter a bunch of stuff.\n\nB.) Pragmatically move the columns over 1 by 1:  IP goes in the 1st free column, Interface name goes in the 2ed, We can't find the Serial so NULL goes in the next one, Model goes in the next one.  With this I can easily stick a new field in the middle without any other work.  The issue is I am just not sure i trust my program all that much.  Also because the info should be a database I am not sure how well the data will hold up, for example 3 rows will be vlan info, with 2 columns each, interfaces will have ~12 columns, but on rows where you have info in the vlans columns you won't have anything in the interface columns.  I think it will make it very hard to keep track of where all the info should go.\n\nPerhaps a starting dictionary?\n\nVlan info start on column H: then each column just moves over one\n\nInterface info start on column K\n\nThat would make it so I only had to update the starting locations for the relative locations, not each item.\n\nAny suggestions?",

In order to do that I wanted to make a while loop that would add seconds and when they exceed 60, add one minute and same for hours and dynamically change the label text to display them. But apparently that doesn't work in GUI apps, in my case my GUI window hasn't even appeared. Now, what's the way to do it? It's a little bit against GUI app rules since they work by refreshing the code all the time so a `while` loop within them makes infinite time before next refresh and that's why it doesn't work. I also looked into some `datetime` tutorials but I don't think they provide a functionality that would help me in this case.",

Just finish your book or your blog you are reading and if you feel confident enough (or even not!) start a little project.\n\nIf you have no clue where to start in the first place [take a look at this summary in /r/learnpython's wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/index#wiki_new_to_programming.3F).\n\n***\n\n#Projects\n\n- webscraping: Using libraries like `requests` or `beautifulsoup` to scrape websites of their content (e.g. webcomics)\n\n- API's: similar to webscraping, use the data from websites (normally in `JSON`-format)\n\n- Twitter: `tweepy` is the go. Have fun with tweeting and analysis, but you need a twitter account and API-token\n\n- Reddit: You can use `praw` to work with the reddit-API to build bot's or do analysis\n\n- Websites: `flask` and `django` are commonly used python-frameworks for web-programming\n\n- math & analysis: `numpy` and `pandas` will be your best friend as well as the plotting library `matplotlib`\n\n- file's and more: the `os` library can handle a lot of file-specific tasks, `shutil` is also useful\n\n- Games: `pygame` is not only useful for games, also for simulations\n\n- GUI: `pyQT` is good for that, you may use `tkinter` or `wxpython` too (thanks /u/jimminy)\n\n\n\n#Links\n\n- [CodingBat](http://codingbat.com/python). Very good for beginners \n\n- [little list of different projects](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TyqD2_oDtiQIh_Y55J5RfeA91JJECc97xYIKM112H9I/mobilebasic?pref=2&pli=1)\n\n- [martyr2s-mega-project-ideas](http://www.dreamincode.net/forums/topic/78802-martyr2s-mega-project-ideas-list/). Huge list for beginners-advanced\n\n- [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/). Math heavy, but a lot of fun if you like problem-solving\n\n- [/r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/). A subreddit for different project ideas\n\n---\n\n\nAnd obviously everything else you can imagine or automate. \n\nFeel free to leave other suggestions or comments, so we can both extend this compilation.\n",
