Free, Libre and open source software (FLOSS) means that everyone has the freedom to use it, see how it works, and change it.\n\nGNU/Linux is a collaborative effort between the GNU project, formed in 1983 to develop the GNU operating system and the development team of Linux, a kernel. Initially Linux was intended to develop into an operating system of its own, but these plans were shelved somewhere along the way.\n\nLinux is also used without GNU in embedded systems, mobile phones and appliances, often with BusyBox or other such embedded tools.\n\n* [What is free software?](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html)\n* [Basic history of GNU/Linux](http://www.gnu.org/gnu/gnu.html)\n* [One man's fight for free software](http://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/11/business/business-technology-one-man-s-fight-for-free-software.html)\n\n# Join us on IRC at #r/linux on freenode.net! \n\n**Don't post image-macros, rage comics, or other drivel here.**\n\n**[Frequently Asked Questions](/r/linux/wiki/faq/)**\n\n# AMA\n\n* Matthew Miller [2015-05-28](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/37l2mf/i_am_matthew_miller_fedora_project_leader_ask_me/) [2017-06-08](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/6fu9ma/im_matthew_miller_fedora_project_leader_ama/)\n\n* [Matthew Garrett](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/2fddvg/im_matthew_garrett_kernel_developer_firmware/)\n\n* [Greg Kroah-Hartman](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/2ny1lz/im_greg_kroahhartman_linux_kernel_developer_ama/)\n\n# GNU/Linux resources:\n\n**GNU/Linux Related:**\n\n* [Kernel](/r/kernel)\n* [GNU](/r/gnu)\n* [LinuxAdmin](/r/linuxadmin)\n* [LinuxDev](/r/linuxdev)\n* [LinuxDevices](/r/linux_devices)\n* [FreeGaming](/r/freegaming) / [OpenSourceGames](/r/opensourcegames) / [LinuxGaming](/r/linux_gaming)\n* [LinuxMemes](/r/linuxmemes)\n* [LinuxQuestions](/r/linuxquestions) / [Linux4noobs](/r/linux4noobs)\n* [DistroHopping](/r/DistroHopping) / [DistroReviews](/r/distroreviews)\n* [Linux Weekly News^\\[\u2197\\]](http://lwn.net)\n* [Linux Hardware](/r/LinuxHardware)\n\n**Distributions:**\n\n* [Arch](/r/archlinux)\n* [CentOS](/r/centos) / [Red Hat](/r/redhat)\n* [Chrome OS](/r/chromeos)\n* [CrunchBang](/r/crunchbang)\n* [Debian](/r/debian)\n* [elementary OS](/r/elementaryos)\n* [Fedora](/r/fedora)\n* [Gentoo](/r/gentoo)\n* [Manjaro](/r/ManjaroLinux)\n* [LinuxMint](/r/linuxmint)\n* [Lubuntu](/r/lubuntu)\n* [NixOS](/r/NixOS)\n* [openSUSE](/r/opensuse) / [SUSE](/r/suse)\n* [OpenWRT](/r/openwrt)\n* [Slackware](/r/slackware)\n* [Solus](/r/solusproject)\n* [Ubuntu](/r/ubuntu)\n* [Xubuntu](/r/xubuntu)\n\n\n**Linux on Mobile:**\n\n* [Android](/r/android)\n* [FirefoxOS](/r/firefoxos)\n* [Jolla (SailfishOS)](/r/jolla)\n* [MeeGo](/r/meego) / [Maemo](/r/maemo)\n* [PostmarketOS](/r/postmarketOS)\n* [Replicant^\\[\u2197\\]](http://replicant.us/)\n* [UbuntuPhone](/r/ubuntuphone)\n* [ZeroPhone](/r/ZeroPhone)\n\n**Movements:**\n\n* [Free Culture](/r/freeculture)\n* [Free Software](/r/freesoftware)\n* [Hack Bloc](/r/HackBloc)\n* [Open Source](/r/opensource)\n\n**Desktop Environments:**\n\n* [Cinnamon](/r/CinnamonDE)\n* [Enlightenment](/r/enlightenmentde) / [e17](/r/e17)\n* [GNOME](/r/gnome)\n* [KDE](/r/kde)\n* [LXDE](/r/lxde)\n* [XFCE](/r/xfce)\n\n**Window Managers:**\n\n* [awesomewm](/r/awesomewm)\n* [Openbox](/r/openbox)\n* [xmonad](/r/xmonad)  \n* [i3](/r/i3wm/)  \n* [UnixPorn](/r/unixporn)\n\n**Learning:**\n\n* [Ask Linux Users](/r/AskLinuxUsers)\n* [CommandLine](/r/commandline)\n* [Linux From Scratch](/r/linuxfromscratch)\n* [Linux Projects](/r/linuxprojects)\n* [Software Freedom Law Center^\\[\u2197\\]](http://www.softwarefreedom.org/resources/)\n* [Raspberry Pi](/r/raspberry_pi)\n\n**Webcasts:**\n\n* [Level 1 Techs^\\[\u2197\\]](https://www.youtube.com/user/teksyndicate)\n* [The Lunduke Hour^\\[\u2197\\]](https://www.youtube.com/user/BryanLunduke)\n* [Linux Action Show](/r/linuxactionshow)\n* [Bad Voltage^\\[\u2197\\]](http://www.badvoltage.org/)\n* [Hacker Public Radio^\\[\u2197\\]](http://hackerpublicradio.org/)\n* [FaiFCast^\\[\u2197\\]](http://faif.us/)\n\n**Creativity:**\n\n* [Blender](/r/blender)\n* [FOSSPhotography](/r/fossphotography)\n* [GIMP](/r/gimp)\n* [Krita](/r/krita)\n* [LibreDesign](/r/libredesign)\n* [LibreOffice](/r/libreoffice/)\n* [LibreStudio](/r/librestudio)\n* [LinuxAudio](/r/linuxaudio)\n* [LinuxFilmMaking](/r/Linux_Filmmaking)\n\n**Other operating systems:**\n\n* [AROS^\\[\u2197\\]](http://aros.sourceforge.net/)\n* [BSD](/r/bsd)\n* [FreeBSD](/r/freebsd)\n* [Genode^\\[\u2197\\]](https://genode.org)\n* [Haiku](/r/haikuos)\n* [HelenOS^\\[\u2197\\]](https://helenos.org)\n* [HURD](/r/hurd)\n* [Minix](/r/minix)\n* [Plan 9](/r/plan9)  \n* [OSdev](/r/osdev)\n\n**Don't see your community listed?** [Find](http://reddit.com/search) or [create](http://www.reddit.com/reddits/create) a subreddit for it, and [add it to the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/linux/wiki/edit/index) when it has over 350 subscribers, and we'll add it to the sidebar.",

            "selftext": "Following up quite a few discussions here comparing Sailfish OS to Android regarding their openness, I'd like to share with you an honest review on the openness of Sailfish OS. My purpose is to cut the wings off from comments like \"proprietary software doesn't belong to /r/linux\" or \"Android is more open than Sailfish\" etc.\n\nTo set my ground, in overall I see openness from a much wider perspective than just licensing. For me it includes open communication with developers, open access to bug reports, enabling and supporting patching and hacking, public mailing lists / chats /forums with devs and end users, an most importantly: Supporting the ideology, which shows in picking up right partners, joining right groups, being open and honest in both good and bad etc.\n\n**The Code.** From \"bottom\" to \"top\", Sailfish OS carries:\n\n1. Device drivers. Proprietary of manufacturers (as in all mobile phones)\n2. Linux Kernel. Based on Vanilla, heavily patched by Jolla. Open source. \n3. Mer Core. Middleware software. Open source expect for two parts of Silica. Uses e.g. libhybris, wayland. \n4. Sailfish UI. User Interface, proprietary of Jolla. Mostly QML so quite accessible and hackable but not commercially distributable*\n5. Pre-installed apps. Mostly proprietary of Jolla with few exeptions. Documents and Browser have been open sourced after first release.*\n\n*w/o a license. Jolla has, however, allowed distribution of these for all community ports. The OS has been ported to more than 50 mobile models, some with great success, some with less. But you could make a phone call with more than 50.\n\nAbout 78% of all the packages in the pre-installed software are open source. I'm not sure about the percentage of code lines, so this number is just for the list of packages.\n\n**Services:**\n\n1. Jolla services (e.g. store access, OTA updates). Using these requires an active Jolla Account. Proprietary of Jolla. Access is allowed for free by Jolla in almost all community ports - devs have simply asked for that for their ports, and the answer has been like \"yeah, we'll enable that\", at least so far.\n2. 3rd party services (e.g. Alien Dalvik, Text prediction, MS Active sync, previously Here Maps. Proprietary of their developers. These features are separately intalled or activated by the user via accepting the license. These features are not available in the community ports.\n\n**Communications:**\n\n1. Jolla supports community development with public guide (HADK) and offering help for devs via freenode chat, open mailing list, public forum and joining in for a scheduled community meeting. Users are sharing patches for the UI and have ported the OS to more than 50 mobile models (sure, not all of them well functional).\n2. Jolla's public comms (marketing) has been awful, even using \"open source\" terminology wrong (notified by OSI), but has gotten a lot better over time. On their latest blog posts, it shows that while the post might be short and avoid mentioning some difficult / not so nice issues, these are yet openly replied right below the post in public commenting section. \n\n**Bug reporting and user feedback:**\n\n1. Jolla has their closed tool for all the bugs in proprietary parts,\n2. and open tool for Mer related bugs.\n3. Additionally they have an open forum where users can report all kinds of bugs. From here, they try to move them into the right tool and report back to the users of the development, but looking at it from outside this doesn't work.*\n\n*Efforts are being done to make things more clear, and it seems that an open bug reporting might be on the way. The main problem is: How to guide the users to use it right, not to make that another mess?\n\n**Patching and hacking:**\n\n1. Most of the code in Jolla's proprietary parts is written in QML and is accessible for the end user. This has enabled for example sharing patches changing the UI or app features, and 3rd party developers have made these available to all users mostly via openRepos. \n2. Jolla supports hacking and patching, looking at how their Sailors help the community in any related issues.\n3. The phone carries **Linux Terminal**, which appears as an app as soon as developer mode is activated. Developer superuser (dev-su) is preinstalled, and there is a possibility to install full su as well. But the dev-su really gives access to about everything one might need below the system. On the normal user (nemo) level, for example changing LED colors or patterns is actully quite easy.\n\n**Ideology:**\n\nHere we have both pros and cons. That Jolla frequently joins open source Mer meeting twice a month, and that they almost ended up partnering with Fairphone are on the pro side. TJC (Jolla's customer forum) has been a disappointment with few nice opposite stories, but in overall, I think the forum has helped the company in forming towards openness. Currently, it's mostly users helping users there. Nice from Jolla to keep it running anyway, with their small resources. For some cons, Jolla seems to join open source events more for their marketing purpose than to share their coding or knowhow, again with few nice opposite examples (for example Carsten Munk did awesome job regarding these). The worst con, hopefully past history, is using term \"open source\" wrongly in Jolla's marketing efforts for a long time. Notified by OSI, and should be fixed by now. But back to the good side: As a nice detail, when Sailfish entered Russian markets, Russian government audited their software (distribution: Sailfish OS RUS) and it ended up to governmental list of supported software as the only mobile OS in that list. And how does that relate to the ideology? Well, Russia would have not taken the software if it wasn't open enough for them. And they also considered Tizen by Samsung.\n\n**The future:**\n\nNot much has happened in the past years regarding more openness. In my undestanding, most people at Jolla would like to open up more but their investors hold onto the proprietary parts, probably seeing those as assets of the company. The management seems like squeezed in between, trying to deliver undestanding and patience to the devs and to the end users, meanwhile delivering trust and image of a positive future to the investors. Management doesn't seem to have any easy road to pick, and to an outsider like me this shows like there are just unkept promises. \n\n**More open than Android?**\n\nWell, what do you think, now that you know a bit more?

As my phone then holds the key to me being able to log on and use these websites this obviously creates a risk if my phone is lost or damaged.\n\nI therefore wondered if there is any software that provides this functionality on Ubuntu?

I wanted to ask the more advanced/experienced users something. \n\nI want to have an OS that is just a terminal with a basic text editor maybe and access to HDD(or a flash drive) to save anything I write. So, a screen just like tty in Ubuntu-based distro(not sure whether it is present in others). I am hoping it will use so little resources that I can write for a longer time than is currently possible with my laptop, maybe I can write while travelling,etc. Currently I get about 2 hours of battery life with my laptop. I have an AMD processor along with an AMD GPU in my laptop and they suck all the battery.\n\nIs there a distro meeting my requirements?\nCan I configure arch in this manner, maybe I can disable the GPU, HDD and the DVD drive and use it with a flash drive? \n\nIs it possible at all with my AMD+AMD system?\n\n",

Both are very promising I am just curious about a few things from those of you who have used the applications...\n\n1) Homebank asks to enter account numbers, does this have to be my actual routing number? If so, what is it used for other than tracking on my local machine? Does it get sent anywhere? \n\nI would appreciate suggestions or alternatives as well. \n\n2) GNU Cash seems to have little documentation from what I can find on Google, Youtube, etc I cant find very much in depth to get me going, I have tried sitting down and reading the GNU documentation, however I just do not have very much free time to read and train, if anyone has any suggestions for guides, etc I would very much appreciate it. \n\n3) Of the two, which is better in the security sense meaning, how secure is the data in the files, and how much of the security is my responsibility i.e. encryption and the like. \n\nI know this seems like a 'hand holding' post, however I am just wanting to get a good jumping off point so I can start to manage my finances better and be able to become financially stable and stay that way.

            "selftext": "Hello there i'm translating the What is free software document from the Free Software Fondation from English to Danish, and i think i'm done but would like to get some danish users to give me some feedback.\n\nhttps://www.fsf.org/resources/resources/what-is-fs\n\nEnglish:\nWhat is free software?\n\nFree software is software that respects our freedom. To use free software is to make a political and ethical choice asserting our rights to learn and to share what we learn with others.\n\nUsually software we buy denies us these rights, because we don't actually buy ownership of the software. Instead, we receive a license to use the software, and this license binds us with many fine-print rules about what we can and can't do.\n\nIf we make a copy and give it to a friend, if we try to figure out how the program works, if we put a copy on more than one of our own computers in our own home, we could if caught be fined or put in jail. That's what's in the fine print.\n\nWhat if there were a worldwide group of talented ethical programmers voluntarily committed to the idea of writing and sharing software with each other and with anyone else who agreed to share alike? What if anyone could be a part of and benefit from this community even without knowing anything about programming? We wouldn't have to worry about getting caught copying a useful program for our friends\u2014because we wouldn't be doing anything illegal.\nThe free software movement\n\nIn fact, such a movement exists, and you can be a part of it. The free software movement was started in 1984 by Richard M. Stallman, when he launched a project called GNU, which stands for ``GNU's Not UNIX'', to provide a replacement for the UNIX operating system\u2014a replacement that would respect the freedoms of those using it. Then in 1985, Stallman started the Free Software Foundation, a nonprofit with the mission of advocating and educating on behalf of computer users around the world.\n\nToday the number of people who are not computer users is dwindling all the time, as technology seeps around the globe. It takes knowledge to make this technology work. People who hoard this knowledge, punishing and threatening others who try to obtain and share it, are not doing so in order to preserve it, despite what they may claim. Instead, they are preserving power for themselves at the expense of others' freedom.\n\nRecognizing this, millions of people around the world\u2014including entire governments\u2014have made the commitment to use only free software on their computers. The fact that so many people are willing to make and stand by this decision in the face of cheaper and cheaper ``deals'' from Microsoft, Apple and other proprietary software companies proves these companies wrong\u2014we don't need them or their fine print to make software.\n\nBecause the copyright laws covering software are often used to take away our freedoms, Stallman and the FSF developed a specific legal document called the GNU General Public License (GPL) to protect them. Instead of restricting what we can do with software the GPL encourages us to learn and share, so it is called a ``copyleft'' license. Thousands of people and businesses\u2014from hobbyists to big companies like IBM and Novell\u2014are now authoring and distributing free software using the GPL.\n\nBut which software to use is a political choice for all of us, not just the people who program and sell it. We can click our freedoms away by signaling Ok in the Microsoft or Macintosh window after squinting through their thirty pages of restrictions, or we can click Cancel, and see instead if there is a piece of free software that does what we need.\n\nWe should click Cancel when we can because that's the more ethical choice. This means we'll have to learn a new program, and sometimes the free program might not work as well. The ethical choice is not always the easy choice.\nGet involved!\n\nYou can start by making a commitment to look for free software alternatives. The Free Software Directory lists over 5,000 free programs.\n\nThere are many other ways for people with and without programming skills to help the free software movement continue to succeed. Please see the websites of the Free Software Foundation and the GNU project, to find out how.\n\nAnd of course, please make copies of this information and share it with others!\n\nDanish:\n\nHvad er fri software?\nFri software er software som respektere vores frihed. At bruge\nfri software er at lave et politisk og etisk valg og h\u00e6vde vores\nrettigheder til at l\u00e6re og dele hvad vi l\u00e6rer med andre.\nNa\u030ar vi k\u00f8ber software forbyder de h\u00f8jst sandsynligvis disse\nrettigheder, fordi vi faktisk ikke k\u00f8ber ejerskab af softwaren.\nIstedet, modtager vi en licens til at bruge den software, og\ndenne licens binder os med mange fint-printede regler omkring\nhvad vi kan og ikke kan g\u00f8re.\nHvis vi laver en kopi og giver den til en ven, hvis vi pr\u00f8ver at\nfinde ud af hvordan programet virker, hvis vi putter en kopi\npa\u030a mere end en af vores egne computere i vores eget hus, vi\nkunne hvis fanget fa\u030a en b\u00f8de eller ryge i f\u00e6ngsel. Det er hvad\nder er i de fint-printede regler.\nHvad hvis der var en global gruppe af talentede etiske pro-\ngram\u00f8re velg\u00f8renligt engageret til ideen om at skrive og dele software med hinanden og med\nalle andre som er enige om at dele ens? Hvad hvis alle kunne v\u00e6re en del af og gavne fra\ndette f\u00e6lleskab selvom han/hun ved noget omkring programering eller ej? Vi skulle ikke\nbekymre os omkring at blive fanget kopier et brugbart program for en ven\u2014pa\u030agrund af at\nvi ikke ville have gjordt noget ulovligt.\nFri Software Bev\u00e6gelsen\nSa\u030adan en bev\u00e6gelse findes faktisk, og du kan blive en del af den.\nFri software bev\u00e6gelsen blev started i 1984 af Richard M. Stallman,\nda han startede et projekt kaldet GNU, hvilket sta\u030ar for \u201cGNU\u2019s Not\nUNIX\u201d, eller pa\u030a dansk \u201dGNU ikke Unix\u201d for tilbyde et alternativ\nfor UNIX styresystemet\u2014et alternativ som ville respektere brugerens\nfriheder. I 1985, startede Stallman the Free Software Foundation, en\nnonprofit orginitation med missionen om at forsvare og udanne pa\u030a\nvejene af computer brugere i hele verden.\nIdag er antallet af personer uden computere hele tiden faldende, som\nteknologien spredes omkring kloden. Det kr\u00e6ver viden at fa\u030a denne\nteknologi til at virke. Personer som hamstre denne viden, straffer og\ntruer andre som pr\u00f8ver at skaffe og dele den, g\u00f8r det ikke for at bevare\nden, pa\u030atrods af hvad de ma\u030aske pa\u030asta\u030ar. Istedet, bevare de deres magt\npa\u030a bekostning af andres frihed.\nI erkendelse af dette millioner af mennesker i hele verden\u2014\ninklusiv hele regeringer\u2014har forpligtet sig til kun at bruge fri\nsoftware pa\u030a deres computere. Faktummet at sa\u030a mange per-\nsoner er villige til at lave og sta\u030a ved dette valg pa\u030atrods af at\nder kommer biligere og biligere \u201cdeals\u201d fra Microsoft, Apple\nog andre propriet\u00e6re software virksomheder beviser disse virk-\nsomhedder forkert\u2014vi har ikke brug for dem og deres regler\nog retningslinger for at lave software.\nVi kan lave det selv. Vi laver det selv.\nHvordan Virker Det? Copyleft!\nPa\u030agrund af de copyright love der d\u00e6kker software ofte bliver brugt til at fjerne vores friheder,\nStallman og the FSF udviklede et specifikt juridisk dokument kaldet the GNU General Public\nLicense (GPL) for at beskytte dem. Istedet for at begr\u00e6nse hvad vi kan g\u00f8re med software the\nGPL opfordre os til at l\u00e6re og dele, sa\u030a det er kaldet en \u201ccopyleft\u201d licens. Tusinder af personer\nog firmare\u2014fra hobbyister til store firmare som IBM og Novell\u2014skriver og distrubere fri\nsoftware ved brug af the GPL.\nMen hvad software vi skal bruge er et politisk valg for os alle, ikke bare de personer der\nprogramere og s\u00e6lger det. Vi kan klikke vores friheder v\u00e6k ved at signalere OK i Microsoft or\nMacintosh vinduet efter at have skimmet igennem deres tredive sider af restriksioner, eller\nvi kan klikke CANCEL, og istedet se om der er noget fri software der g\u00f8r det som vi har brug\nfor.\nVi skulle klikke CANCEL na\u030ar vi kan pa\u030agrund af at det er det mest etisk korrekte valg. Dette\nbetyder vi bliver n\u00f8dt til at l\u00e6re et nyt program, og nogne gange virker det frie program\nikke lige sa\u030a godt som de ikke frie. Det etiske valg er ikke altid det nemmeste valg.\nBliv Involveret\nDu kan starte ved at forpligte dig til at s\u00f8ge efter frie software alternativer. The Free Software\nDirectory (http://directory.fsf.org) har over 5,000 frie programmer.\nDer er mange andre ma\u030ader for personer med og uden programerings f\u00e6rdigheder at hj\u00e6lpe\nfri software bev\u00e6gelsen forts\u00e6ttes med at lykkedes. Se venligst hjemmesiderne for the Free\nSoftware Foundation (http://www.fsf.org) og the GNU project, (http://www.gnu.org)\nto find out how.\nOg selvf\u00f8lgelig, v\u00e6r venlig at kopiere disse oplysninger og dele dem med andre!\nCopyright c 2000, 2001, 2005, 2006 Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, 5th Floor,\nBoston, MA 02110, USA.\nVerbatim copying and distribution of this entire article is permitted in any medium, provided this\nnotice is preserved.\n\nEDIT: Har self\u00f8lgelig skrevet det som det rigtige dokument i pdf.

            "selftext": "One of the first problem that a Windows-convert on Linux faces is how to find apps. They are foreign to the concept of package managers.\n\nA Mac-convert even though has been initiated about package managers, still wonders where are the apps?\n\nSo, they searching for apps on the 'internet' and download the executable and install them, like a good old Windows user without verifying source.\n\nWhat I am proposing is unified app store for Linux. Linux community is huge and there are a lot of people scattered around different distros. If we all could have a single app store where a given app has it's own page, and all the comments that people post about the app. The app store also has screenshots (and users can upload and vote them). When the user clicks the 'Install' button the browser detects the distro and hotlink to the official repository executable. And if the official distro doesn't have a software, then we can redirect to an appropriate link like GitHub or StackExchange with relevant info.\n\nThe devs can add their description, whats new and all. They don't then the community will. Ubuntu has a store like this but since only Unity users access it and it was abandoned, it is full of outdated reviews and very few users know about it. But a unified app store will bring all of Linux users to the same platform.\n\nPeople will be able to see screenshots, how far behind their distro is, in terms of latest version, compare which distro has the latest version. Users and devs all get visibility. And new linux users won't wonder into untrustworthy sites.\n\nTakes a lot of work but the linux community is not small and it has a lot of patience.",

            "selftext": "Yesterday, there was a lot of backlash from both camps: supporters of open source felt that Microsoft's inclusion into OSI isn't a good thing, whereas supporters of Microsoft and other companies feel that it isn't that bad for linux and open source.\n\nWhat's happening right now isn't happening in a vacuum, but is a result of constant struggle and synergy between various software development projects/organizations for more than two decades. If one thing hasn't changed between these organizations, it is their attitudes.\n\nIn the early 1990s when Microsoft was all \"bad and proprietary\" and used to do evil things like bundling the IE browser with Windows, something good had emerged. For example, the Netscape company (Mozilla's predecessor) which was on the verge of getting bankrupt saw a ray of hope in things, and with a great leap of faith towards their vision, open sourced the firefox browser. Their bet paid off and firefox became a very well known open source browser preferable even to IE.\n\nBut on the other hand, look at the same Mozilla corporation today. Now that Microsoft has sort of mellowed down, Mozilla seems to have lost all that charm. Today, they are going ahead with implementing things like DRM and EME extensions (the very sort of things that had resulted in their former bankruptcy and goes against their open source vision). They are also supporting the DRM/EME standard in W3C (if the rumors are true).\n\nSo, what do we need now? Do we need the proprietary companies to become \"evil\" again so that open source organizations like Mozilla are inspired once again?",

This beta release is mainly to get an idea of whether people like the idea of this OS. If so, then we can work on releasing more betas till a stable release. Ofcause there is a lot that can be done differently, there is a lot that still needs to be done, but I gave myself a deadline to release this beta, just so that you can have an idea of what the final product will be like if enough people are interested.\n\nHere is the demo video for eXtern OS: https://youtu.be/-5tak0tHqIg.\n\nYou can now go and download it from the eXtern OS website: https://externos.io\n\nI would like to hear from you!

            "selftext": "So. I thought of this post when I saw a couple of the posts on the front page about Microsoft. One was RMS attacking MS, and one was about Microsoft joining the open source initiative. And it struck me that people might actually not know the sheer scope of Microsofts scummy behaviour over the years. Some asked for clarifications and others for sources for claims about these things. So I figured I'd do people a favour and collect as much of Microsofts bad behaviour as I can. So people can have some semblance of understanding as to why people don't quite trust them.\n\nWe'll start with the easiest to find, the \"Halloween Documents\". The Halloween Documents were internal memos leaked to Eric S. Raymond in 1998, which is pretty much dinosaur age in internet years. [Here's the Wikipedia link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween_documents)\n\n\nSome notable things to take away from it:\n\n- Document I revealed that \"FUD\" (spreading fear, uncertainty, and doubt) was a traditional Microsoft marketing strategy, acknowledged and understood internally\n\n- Document I suggests that one reason that open source projects have been able to enter server market is its use of standardized protocols. The document then suggests that this can be stopped by \"extending these protocols and developing new protocols\" and \"de-commoditize protocols & applications.\" This policy has been nicknamed \"embrace, extend, extinguish\". Document I also suggests that open source software \"is long-term credible ... FUD tactics can not be used to combat it,\" and \"Recent case studies (the Internet) provide very dramatic evidence ... that commercial quality can be achieved / exceeded by OSS projects.\"\n\n(Quick sidenote: Microsoft knew in 1998 that they needed something else to fight open source.)\n\n- An e-mail from consultant Mike Anderer to SCO Group's Chris Sontag, also known as Halloween X: Follow The Money. The document describes, among other points, Microsoft's channeling of US$86 (equivalent to $109.05 in 2016) million to SCO.\n\nNow, I'm going to bring up another thing, which is the Sun vs Microsoft lawsuit regarding Java. What happened was that there was an actual Microsoft implementation of Java that shipped with Windows, originally made so that IE3 could run Java applets. However, Microsoft tried to extend Java with proprietary extensions making Suns \"write once ~~debug~~ run everywhere\" claim broken. They settled this case after some time in court, but it was referenced in the antitrust trial. Here's some information from that:\n\n- In short, Microsoft feared and sought to impede the development of network effects that cross-platform technology like Netscape Navigator and Java might enjoy and use to challenge Microsoft's monopoly. Another internal Microsoft document indicates that the plan was not simply to blunt Java/browser cross-platform momentum, but to destroy the cross-platform threat entirely, with the \"Strategic Objective\" described as to \"Kill cross-platform Java by grow[ing] the polluted Java market.\"\n\n[Source from Wikipedia regarding Microsoft Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Java_Virtual_Machine)\n\nAnd now, some fun fact from the antitrust trial.\n\n- Intel Vice-President Steven McGeady, called as a witness, quoted Paul Maritz, a senior Microsoft vice president, as having stated an intention to \"extinguish\" and \"smother\" rival Netscape Communications Corporation and to \"cut off Netscape's air supply\" by giving away a clone of Netscape's flagship product for free\n\n- Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson issued his findings of fact on November 5, 1999, which stated that Microsoft's dominance of the x86-based personal computer operating systems market constituted a monopoly, and that Microsoft had taken actions to crush threats to that monopoly, including Apple, Java, Netscape, Lotus Software, RealNetworks, Linux, and others.\n\n- Judge Jackson's response to this was that Microsoft's conduct itself was the cause of any \"perceived bias\"; Microsoft executives had, according to him, \"proved, time and time again, to be inaccurate, misleading, evasive, and transparently false. ... Microsoft is a company with an institutional disdain for both the truth and for rules of law that lesser entities must respect. It is also a company whose senior management is not averse to offering specious testimony to support spurious defenses to claims of its wrongdoing.\"\n\nRemember this when talking about Bill Gates: He's a criminal mastermind, running a mobster-like organization. His ill-gotten gain is the result of systematic criminal behaviour from him and his company. While he's of course not at Microsoft today, he built the corporate culture there. [Wikipedia source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Microsoft_Corp.)\n\nThey also tried to shaft another contractual partner. They licensed a browser from Spyglass which became Internet Explorer. Now, at this point in time, usually browsers cost money. Netscape Navigator cost money, and so did most others. In their contract with Spyglass for IE they agreed that Microsoft would pay a percentage of the sales from IE to Spyglass. However, Microsoft then gave away IE for free with Windows(You know, \"cutting off the air supply\" to Netscape) and then claimed they didn't have to pay royalties because they were giving it away. A technicality? Maybe. Legal? Uncertain. Immoral? Most definitively. [They settled before it ever made to court though.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spyglass,_Inc.)\n\nIn earlier days, they also obfuscated API access to try and hamper both other versions of DOS and WordPerfect. Unfortunately the antitrust lawsuit between Novell and Microsoft got dismissed in 2012. There were several problems with DR-DOS and WordPerfect on MS-DOS and Windows. The jury is still out on whether or not it was intentional, but I'll leave this quote from Jim Allchin here:\n\n- Microsoft Co-President Jim Allchin stated in a memo, \"If you're going to kill someone there isn't much reason to get all worked up about it and angry. Any discussions beforehand are a waste of time. We need to smile at Novell while we pull the trigger.\"\n\n- Microsoft Senior Vice President Brad Silverberg later sent another memo, stating: \"What the [user] is supposed to do is feel uncomfortable, and when he has bugs, suspect that the problem is DR-DOS and then go out to buy MS-DOS.\"\n\nThis is a lot of history though, and I understand that people don't automatically believe this is the case today. However, I will make a case that this kind of thinking and corporate culture breeds the same type of people. It's not like Microsoft was made up of upstanding people and just a few bad eggs, it was probably the other way around.\n\nBut then, let's take a look at \"Get The Facts\", which is a bit newer, only 13 years old. It was Microsoft using Microsoft-funded \"studies\" claiming that Linux was insecure, it was bad for servers, unstable, no commercial support etc. This is the one I remember most of myself, because everywhere I went I got that incredibly annoying \"London Stock Exchange uses Microsoft Windows\"-ad. They lied about the security even if you followed their own lax standards for themselves. It was a smear campaign, hilariously though, the LSE switched to Linux when Accenture and Microsoft brought them down in flames. [I managed to find a youtube video of a \"Get The Facts\" commercial.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwSM55bsCrM) \n\n[And here's an example of the \"Highly Reliable Times\"](http://www.microsoft.com/library/media/1033/windowsserver/facts/graphics/images/ncsoftbanner.jpg)\n\n\nThis campaign didn't work either. Both SUSE and RH kept going strong, and the community distributions as well. So the next path of attack was patents. They claimed Linux breached 235 patents. Weirdly specific number. But oddly, they were never more specific than numbers:\n\n- The numbers and locations of the alleged violations break down as follows: 42 violations within the Linux kernel itself, 65 within the \"Linux GUI,\" though the article doesn't specify whether these infringements apply to one GUI or apply equally to all the Linux desktop environments. OpenOffice allegedly violates an additional 45 patents, e-mail programs infringe on another 15 patents, and an unspecified array of \"other\" OSS programs violate a further 68 patents.\n\nYou will notice though, that they never said **which** patents. Just the number. Unfortunately, Novell entered into a patent agreement with Microsoft about these, and gave them some extra ammunition. Luckily, Red Hat wasn't having anything of it, and offered patent protection to their customers. \n\nLastly, I almost didn't want to mention it, because I hate those fuckers that started this lawsuit so incredibly much. But Microsofts bullshit detector had to have been non-working when they funded the SCO lawsuit, they probably programmed it themselves. Either way, they sent upwards of 50$ million dollars to the criminal scumbags at SCO. Funding what amounted to the most pointless lawsuit ever. First of all, there was no copyright infringement, secondly, SCO didn't even own the copyright they were suing about. It got into a petty contract dispute with IBM in the end, and IBM is not one to be taken to the cleaners by legal trolls.\n\n\nWhat I am saying there though, is not that Microsoft can't change. And not that they don't \"love\" open source and Linux. But a few good moves does not erase a lifetime of criminal and unethical behaviour. So when you want to sling insults at someone being sceptical of Microsofts intentions, keep this quote in mind:\n\n- \"We need to smile at Novell while we pull the trigger.\"\n\nIf it doesn't give you even a little bit of a chill, then I put it to you that you didn't fully understand the quote.\n\nEDIT: I just realized I forgot loads of shit. Secure boot, OOXML ISO corruption, claiming open source as a target for terrorists, conspiring with NSA for surveillance, and just a funny bit: [They photoshopped a black man white, but forgot his hands](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/08/26/microsofts-ad-in-poland-p_n_269366.html)",

I assume it will be enabled by default at some point, but it isn't yet in Firefox 58 (the current nightly).\n\n1. Run this command:\n\n    echo export MOZ_USE_XINPUT2=1 | sudo tee /etc/profile.d/use-xinput2.sh\n\n2. Log out and back in.\n3. Firefox should now use xinput 2.\n4. (optional) Open Firefox and go to `about:preferences` -> Advanced (or `about:preferences` -> Browsing for Firefox Nightly), and uncheck \"Use smooth scrolling\".

So, where will this other player with an equal or bigger scale come from? I think the only one who has the potential to do so is Amazon who doesn't seem interested in building a search engine.\n\nAnother option for us is to not wait for a new player and build a decentralized one of our own (similar to how other distributed technologies like Mastodon, GNUSocial or the blockchain systems work). Is it conceivable in the near future that this might happen? If every linux nerd out there in the world gets interested in this search engine and if some of them host it on their servers, then the sum total of such servers can hope to compete with the massive data centers of google.

            "score": 689, 
            "selftext": "**Why?**\n\nHi all. As you know the W3C recently [voted to cripple the open web with DRM as a web standard](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/715o2z/w3c_rejected_appeal_on_web_drm_eff_resigns_from/). This is a catastrophic move, but unfortunately it's so [technical and boring](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/w3c-eff-open-standards-web-cory-doctorow) that it's extremely hard for most people to understand or care why. This drastic change, that will impact all of society, didn't even get noticed outside of the most nerdy of nerdy circles.\n\nIn 2014 Cory Doctorow briefly introduced [his podcast](http://craphound.com/podcast/) with [a few words on DRM in browsers](https://corydoctorow.miraheze.org/wiki/Flowers_From_Al_02). I've never heard him sound so depressed or hopeless. But there is also one of my favorite quotes of him to explain why this matter so much:\n\n> The reason my hope for the future and my hope for the internet are bound up is that it's hard to imagine how we can meaningfully change the world if we don't have the possibility of a free and open internet to use to organize that change.\n\nThis is why we need to work on communication, to reach more people. One person who does this better than most when it comes to the perils of DRM and other threats to the open web and peoples digital safety and autonomy is \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 Cory Doctorow.\n\n**How?**\n\nUnfortunately  a lot of what he does are talks or interviews that are only available as sound or video. This means people can't find it trough search engines and can't easily quote it (like with [great quotes like this](https://i.imgur.com/AtFnpGy.png)), or just skim trough it if they don't have time to watch a whole lecture.\n\nFor this reason I've been working on a project to transcribe Cory's talks and interview for a year now (not continually, I've had a lot of other things to do).\n\nI've [set up a wiki for this project](https://corydoctorow.miraheze.org/) (on the fantastic FOSS [Miraheze](https://meta.miraheze.org/) wikifarm), in the hopes that I can engage more people to transcribe a little bit now and then whenever they have a few minutes free. And that's my goal in posting this on Reddit now; to get more help in this important effort.\n\n**Making it easy to contribute**\n\nI focus on one talk/interview at a time. I post that one as the \"Talk of the fortnight\" (ToF) on the front page of the wiki. To make it even easier to contribute I use a collaborative online text editor to work on that talk. For example right now [this conversation between Cory and Edward Snowden](https://cryptpad.fr/pad/#/1/edit/txSACarD1gqPjFGun6WToQ/yK+5ILVJZQCiqmLBBQtUQOpW/) recorded at the New York Public Library earlier this year is the ToF.\n\nBut anyone can also edit any page on the wiki at any time, for example to add more metadata, like a summary of a talk, the best quote from it, subheadings, timestamps etc \u2013 or just to work on transcribing some other talk. I've created [a \"how to get started\" page](https://corydoctorow.miraheze.org/wiki/Meta), and tried to make it as simple and easy to understand as possible (Please let me know if anything is unclear! \u2013 or, you know, just edit the page yourself :))\n\nMaybe we could also create a \"simple english\" page explaining the dangers of DRM in a less technical language than Cory does? I'm open to any idea to make the wiki better or easier to use.\n\nI'd be very happy if you would like to help out in any way! Either by bookmarking the page and go there to transcribe a bit from time to time, or [do other things](https://corydoctorow.miraheze.org/wiki/Meta#How_to_start_contributing). Or by spreading the word or referring to it in discussion, like Cory himself has done on Twitter.\n\n**The most important thing you can do**\n\nAt the end of his talk [Security and feudalism: Own or be pwned](https://corydoctorow.miraheze.org/wiki/Security_and_feudalism:_Own_or_be_pwned) Cory implores the audience to do something about this danger to society. He asks people to [donate to the EFF](https://supporters.eff.org/donate/) and/or other organizations like it. But more importantly, he says, is to tell more people about the issue:\n\n> Find two deep nerds who already understand all that stuff, and explain what I've just told you to them. Because EFF has tens of thousands of members, Slashdot has hundreds of thousands of readers, Hacker News has millions of readers, and Reddit has tens of millions of readers. We have a lot of people who are ready to understand what the hell all this stuff means, people who you don't have to give the technical education to. And we can build a movement by bringing those people along and having them explain to the people they love what they can do too.\n \nMy hope is that this wiki will make it easier for more people to do just that.\n\nThank you for your time!\n\nAgain, here's the wiki: https://corydoctorow.miraheze.org/\n\n------------\n\n^PS: ^This ^project ^is ^very ^meaningful ^for ^me, ^and ^I ^want ^to ^keep ^doing ^it ^no ^matter ^what. ^At ^the ^same ^time; ^My ^economical ^situation ^is ^not ^great ^right ^now. ^I've ^been ^without ^a ^job ^for ^a ^few ^years, ^and ^I ^can't ^dedicate ^too ^much ^time ^to ^this. ^And ^it ^does ^take ^a ^lot ^of ^time. ^I ^spend ^about ^30 ^minutes ^to ^transcribe ^5 ^minutes ^of ^audio, ^including ^finding ^helpful ^links ^and ^do ^spell ^checking. ^In ^addition ^comes ^all ^the ^other ^work ^needed ^to ^get ^the ^wiki ^to ^function.\n\n^I've ^been ^thinking ^that ^maybe ^there ^are ^others ^out ^there ^who ^find ^this ^project ^to ^be ^as ^important ^as ^I ^do, ^but ^with ^less ^time ^to ^spend ^on ^it, ^but ^more ^money. ^Maybe ^there ^could ^be ^a ^potential ^for ^me ^to ^set ^up ^a ^Patreon ^and/or ^Liberapay ^for ^this ^project, ^to ^help ^me ^dedicate ^more ^time ^to ^it? ^What ^do ^you ^think?\n\n---------\n\nEdit: Thank you, kind stranger, for the gold and these words:\n> It's good to see such idealism, it brightens my day even though I'm myself far too jaded and cynical to contribute.

However, I'm hoping to replace it completely, so I'm looking for notation software that can run on Linux.\n\nRequirements would be:\n\nDecent GUI\n\nSome form of instant playback (MIDI is fine, though not ideal)\n\nI'm running Manjaro, and I saw the Arch User Repository has some software, but I'd rather get recommendations than download a bunch of stuff and see what works.\n\nProprietary software isn't ideal, but is acceptable.

And it seems that the presenter is not very happy with the quality of the laptop and he says that there are several problems with it. Also Librem broke some of their promises about terms of shipment (almost year later) and about hardware (2 cores instead of 4, no external gpu, no ethernet port). Also, there were another problems. With all this it had the price of a MacBook Pro.\n\nAt the same time Puri.sm promises to ship their first Librem 5 phones in January, 2019, but I've never seen any prototype of their phone (only 3d-renders).

This won't magically turn a bad application into a good one, of course, but it's another step closer to a consistent desktop environment. You can [see some screenshots](https://github.com/CrimsonAS/gtkplatform/wiki) with comparisons against some other platform plugins.\n\nIt's very very early days, I'm sure a lot of things won't work yet, but feel free to give it a shot and see how it goes for you.

His insistence on whining continually against proprietary software companies has actually caused more harm than good.

Do you feel that Linux is going in the right direction? That slowly is becoming a more unified experience like windows and mac? Do you think that one day we'll have as much market share as Apple at least?\n\nIn my opinion, at least from what I see I feel that Red Hat is slowly pushing and unifying the Linux world with technologies that simplify things. \n\nI've seen technologies like SystemD, PulseAudio and now Pipewire, being or becoming a thing. It also feels like gnome is becoming the standard in what comes to DEs, I don't if I'm wrong for saying this but I feel that Linux is finally less fragmented and more focused on making things easier for us users and developers, cleaner, better looking and more organised. Coming closer to the Windows and Mac experience. \n\nOne thing I don't like about Gnome is how limited it is without extensions, customisation is better on KDE, but then again I think.. Maybe it's the price to pay for having more people to flock, because the vast majority only wants something that just works and doesn't overwhelm or confuse them.\n\nI know technically Linux is superior, but when it comes to GUIs, and a few things here and there, like mouse acceleration, having many monitors, Nvidia prime it's still feels far behind..",

We'll create a new MIME type/XDG standard (file/directory selector).\n1. The file pickers will be 3rd party apps, just like file explorers. Users/distros/DEs will install their own file picker.\n2. A file picker will communicate with an app via JSON protocol. Through this, the app will instruct whether it wants a list of files or directories, open or create files/directories, expected number of files/directories, expected file types, password authentication (if required) etc.\n3. In case that the system fails to detect a preferred file selector, the apps will open gtk/qt/native file selector.\n\n\nThe file selectors will be stripped down version of file explorers. This way the users will be free to choose their own file selector of choice.\n\nThis adheres to the Unix philosophy because:\n\n0. Designed solely for the sole purpose of file selection. However the implementation (of course) will vary since the file selector devs will want different features in their apps.\n1. It rids us of the dependence from a monolithic widget and a widget tool (see gtk)\n2. Communicates with other applications by pipes, expects input and returns output.\n\nWhat do you guys think? And how can I talk to freedesktop folks about adopting this new standard?",

Most people don't have the nerdy capacity to maintain their in-house data centers, so again they are obviously seeking the cloud providers like Amazon AWS or Digital Ocean to create their own Ubuntu instances. Are those instances any more secure and \"hack-proof\" than say Google Drive or Dropbox? Maybe not as you cannot configure them as perfectly as those who are experts in the business.\n\nSo the real question is, are *IAAS* (Infrastructure As A Service) providers any better than *SAAS* (Software As A Service) providers from security and privacy perspective? Or in Bryan Lunduke's analogy, is home made food really that healthy than Burger King's food when most of the raw materials have similarly baked ingredients?",

Mine isn't quite that bad... but it feels like a rite of passage.\n\nI've dabbled with Linux in the past but have only been using it full-time for about 18 months. Anyway... running a fairly new install of Debian and found it wouldn't read a ntfs drive I had. I didn't actually need it, but thought it would be worth tinkering with to fix. So, as a relative noob, I did what I usually do and just looked it up online. I found someone with the answer. Just install ntfs-3g, create a directory and... add this line to fstab. So I did, without really looking at it.\n\nThe drive didn't work. Oh well. I went on my merry way and forgot about it. Some time later, I rebooted... or tried to. But I kept getting kicked into emergency mode, and I had no idea why. And I couldn't find anyone online with the same problem to tell me what to do. Crap.\n\nDesperate, I looked at the error log and saw that there was a problem with /mnt/ntfs. Wait a minute - I did something to that. So I found a Ubuntu live USB I had lying around, booted up, and deleted the directory I created and my stupid additions to fstab. **And it worked**.\n\nI know it's not the worst error or an especially hard fix in the grand scheme of things. But this time, *I* worked out how to fix it. I knew where to look, and the (admittedly basic) commands I needed to get it done.\n\nI broke it. I fixed it. I wasted at least two hours.

This daemon is intended to be ran on embedded devices, and I figure that there are already existing system monitoring tools with their web frontend where you can set up the network adapters, WiFi credentials, and can check out information about temperature, voltage, memory usage, CPU usage etc. So, the idea is that I'd simply extend such a web frontend to incorporate widgets for configuring my daemon.\n\nHowever, I only mostly find large *network* management systems such as Zabbix or Zenoss. Ideally, such a system monitoring software would have a web frontend that looks like the web interface of OpenWRT or DD-WRT for example. But, so far, I haven't found any that (a) can be ran on embedded, Rasperry Pi/i.MX/Dragonboard-class hardware without using a significant amount of resources and/or having a lot of complexity of which 90% will end up unused (I do not need to watch the whole network, for example), (b) has a web frontend already provided (otherwise it would be pointless for my purpose), and (c) allows for relatively easy extension of said web frontend.\n\nAny suggestions?\n\n",

            "selftext": "So, I've noticed that a lot of theme authors just stick to GTK 3 and 2 and forget about Qt because QGtkStyle handles it for them.\n\nWhile the Qt and KDE communities have traditionally done a good job of handling this situation, I feel like Qt deserves a bit more love. Still, it's been pretty hard since QWidget styles traditionally need to be written as a C++ application. However, our good friend Pedram Pourang recently (2 years ago) made [Kvantum](https://github.com/tsujan/Kvantum), a theme engine which allows us to easily use SVGs and a plaintext definition file to style Qt applications. Awesome!\n\nSo, given how we now have highly usable tools for theming across toolkits, I think we should kick off another theme explosion like we had in the mid-to-late noughties. To get an idea of where to start, I want to ask you- what are some of your favorite GTK 2 themes which didn't make the jump from 2 to 3? I think there's a lot of value back there that we could bring back from the dead, as it were.",

            "selftext": "**TLDR;** Highly recommend. Hope the detail is helpful to someone on the fence.\n\n\nWanted to write up my experience with Linux Foundation's training since there is literally zero third-party information out there about their development training courses (lots of info on sysadmin oriented certs/courses). I work in the IoT field and we use embedded Linux in our products, so I was looking to expand my knowledge in that area. There aren't many options out there, a lot of this field is simply on-the-job experience but I did come across several interesting courses provided by the Linux Foundation. I've had no prior interaction w/ the Linux Foundation, they weren't recommended to me, I just stumbled across it and took a chance.\n\n\n**Enrollment**  \nTheir website is fine, the course syllabus looked great, but other than some basic details about location city and date, I wasn't really sure what to expect. I believe there's 2 things LF can do to improve this process: 1) An instructor profile (who turned out to be really top notch) would have boosted my confidence to sign up, but you're basically left to assume LF isn't going to steer you wrong. 2) Once you actually do sign up, there was very little communication. I received an invoice w/ an address on it and that was it. So I booked flights, hotel, rental car, etc. and showed up to a building with no idea what to expect.\n\n\n**Course**  \nI specifically took \"Developing Embedded Linux Device Drivers\" (LFD435) but there are numerous other courses offered that also look very interesting. For this course, and likely any involving embedded/kernel/device drivers, you will need to be proficient in C to really get the most out of the class. I'd recommend having C experience on a POSIX system and be familiar with compiling, makefiles, and syscalls like select()/poll() because it'll only make it more challenging to write a driver that supports those interfaces if you're not familiar. It's also necessary to have some understanding of low-level hardware and devices in general, but you don't need to be an EE (I'm not) to take this course.\n\n\nYou'll receive a quality book on day one that covers all the material and lab exercises in the course, plus some additional material. You'll also receive a kit for performing the labs, which in my case, included a BeagleBone Black single board computer, a USB hub that also includes built-in ethernet/SD card reader, and a real FTDI USB-to-serial cable (not a cheap clone). They also provided scripts and other resources to install all necessary dependencies on your machine (you will need a native Linux laptop) and get everyone up an running without worrying about setup minutiae.\n\n\nMy class was small, which turned out to be a great experience, because we could move rapidly through material and were able to go through additional chapters that were marked as optional. I'm sure part of the experience depends on the other students, but this group was dedicated and willing to push through lunch each day. I knew from the syllabus that the course was going to cover subjects that I wanted, but what I didn't know was that the instructor had been involved in the development of some of those subjects and had both deep knowledge of how they work and why they were designed in the fashion they were. I really have to give a shout out to Instructor John Bonesio, because it was great to pick his brain. You can tell he is passionate about his craft as a teacher, cares about his students, and doesn't just read off some powerpoint slides, but enforces concepts with real world project examples from his own career in the industry.\n\n**Summary**  \nThe course was overall a great experience, and would recommend it highly. I honestly hope to attend more trainings with the Linux Foundation. I do wish they would offer price breaks on groups of 2-3 because once you add up course cost + travel expenses for a week, it gets costly, even for a medium sized business.\n",

Sure, what the hell. After Apt ran for a while, it ended with an error. No biggie. It's Apt, probably an outdated source or something. Closed it and started to study but something was off.\n\nDolphin and Okular wouldn't start. Long story short: some qt 5.9 lib was deleted and things got messy. Tried to restart but it's only me and the terminal now. Now I should probably mention that I'm still getting the hang of things in Linux so this was not something I wanted to deal with at all, and especially not today.\n\nI spend the next 2 hours scrapping the packages list to rollback the update, but I couldn't get the wifi to connect neither with wpa nor nm. \nDefeated, I'm installing Fedora on a different partition to get me through the month.\n\nTLDR; updated my laptop 2 days before my finals, things got messed up and I ended up wasting half my day.\n\n@admins: I figured r/tifu wouldn't appreciate the suffering and r/linux would get a kick out of it.\n/Rant",

Many of the counters in netstat I know very well as they have some great in depth explanations around the web.\n\nHowever, many of the netstat counters are a complete mystery to me. I can infer what they mean a little by their name. But I'm not someone who just guesses like that. I am someone who likes to know exactly what is going on with these statistics down to the last function.\n\nIs there a place which explains every single netstat statistic and counter available? Someplace WITHOUT having to dig through the kernel and netstat code? Today I saw an issue with a quickly incrementing \"other TCP timeouts\" field. Googling this gave me not direct information about this specific statistic. Which is frustrating. Or below there is \"embryonic SYN_RECV sockets\".

Yes I can read the entire book and probably piece together each and every single part of these statistics but that isn't what I'm looking for.

So you could run your syntax check on these systems, such as in Docker.\n\nOr, I thought it would be worthwhile to write a dedicated application that can be run on any Linux distribution, or even macOS and Windows.

I've looked at all the different versions of KeePass (2, x, xc, etc...) and XC seems to be the best solution for a Linux user with the most features/better maintained.\n\nThe biggest issue I'm having with making the switch is finding a proper browser extension that is compatible with XC. So far the only thing I've found is [this](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-uS/firefox/addon/keepassxc-browser/). It seems promising, but it also requires a fork of KeePassXC, which differs from the development branch and doesn't seem to be updated as often.\n\nI'm also aware of [PassIFox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-uS/firefox/addon/passifox/), but it's not compatible with the current version of Firefox.\n\nHas anyone found a way to integrate KeePassXC with Firefox on Linux?\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nEdit: Thanks eveyone for your suggestions.

Since Sunday night we've had no power, no cable/internet/phone, and no running water. I have to use a 5 gallon bucket of hurricane pond water I collect to flush the toilet.\n\nBut Linux has provided some relief! We got power back on, but still no cable/internet. I was able to get AT&T wifi, but only one corner in one room of my apartment. To share this internet connection I configured a Linux laptop as a SOCKS dante proxy server. I ran an ethernet cable from my laptop to my router, then I configure all other devices in my house to go through my laptop to access the internet. Next I helped my condo neighbors access the internet going through my Linux powered SOCKS proxy server. Now we all can get online to read news like boiled water alerts and send family/friends emails notifying them we're okay. All thanks to Linux. TY!",

When trying to install it i got a message that it couldn't get anything from one of the Ubuntu Archive sites so i followed the link and i said it was a domainless site.\n\nI then tested the old system they had since i knew that Zorin (The old OS the used) also ran on Ubuntu and i got the same error. \nI knew i had to come up with a solution so i ended up testing if things worked on the Fedora side of things. I DL'd Fedora LXDE spin and installed it and installed all the software without any difficulties.\n\nI ended up going with Fedora LXDE and everyone at the school seemed very pleased with the system, so i wanted to donate a little bit of money to the LXDE project for saving my ass. \nDo anyone know where i can donate since they don't link to it on their website as far as i've seen.",

            "selftext": "tl'dr\n===\nThis a mini-guide for taking dashcam video files form a ThinkWare f770 dash came and turning it into a timelapse gif.\n\nDisclaimer\n=======\n\nI realize anyone familiar with ffmpeg and video post-production is probably better informed on this.  Last month when I started trying to figure this out while I had a small Multiple sclerosis flare which hit my ability to see text (but not numbers for whatever reason).  With MS my brain was able to rewire around the damage so I am good for now.    Anyone who read my last text post may remember that and I apologize if it was incomprehensible.\n\nRecommendations for improvements is greatly welcomed!\n\n\nNOTE\n==\nThis involves some serious harddrive capacity requirements (terabytes for multiple days) as well as multiple micro SD cards because thinkware will wrap around to overwrite old continuous recorded minutes when it runs out of space.  For my longer drives, I can easily fill up three 64GB cards (depending on how many events I have from potholes or such).  Thinkware is also a bitch in that even though I have 64GB's it seems to randomly loop back at 31GB (I lost most of calgary because of that surprise).\n\nMinimum recommendations: \n\n* 300GB of storage space for the video files, merged video, unoptimized gif, and the final product gif.\n* 16GB of ram (14GB's can work but...)  as you need to give your virtual machine a minimum of 12GB's.  Your computer is basically a video render box while you are doing all of this.  \n* CPU - As fast you can get your greedy little hands on.  Clockspeed is more important than cores as most of these tools are sequential and the extra cores are nice to haves so you can do basic stuff on your host computer.  In my case, I used to be a system administrator and code monkey so my box is a bit beefier than normal people's (excepting gamers with more money than sense).\n* Hardrive speed - Not as important as most of this is CPU and memory bound (speed of your CPU and amount of memory available) but below 7200 rpm it can add sometimes an another hour for making the mega-merged video.\n\n\nQuick terms\n=======\n\n* Host computer - Your actual physical computer with Windows or perhaps OSX installed  \n* Guest instance - An operating system (sky is the limit, you can run OSX on Windows or vice versa, or in this case linux)  \n* Virtual machine - An operating system running as a guest instance on your host computer  \n* Virtual box - https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/VirtualBox , software for running virtual machine instances on your computer.    \n* Debian Linux - https://www.debian.org/  \n* Ubuntu - A flavor of Debian that is easier to get started with https://www.ubuntu.com/  \n* Kubuntu - https://kubuntu.org/ , a fork of Ubuntu (which is a fork of Debian) that I have used for the last decade so I am use to it.  \n\n\nIf you're not familiar with using linux, this can be a bit of a learning cliff on its own, so I recommend googling for getting started with virtual box and ubuntu guides.  The first google result doesn't seem so bad http://lifehacker.com/5778882/getting-started-with-linux-the-complete-guide\n\nhttp://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/virtualbox\n\nIf you can get Virtual Box's guest additions installed (this will make a bit more sense when you play with Virtual box) you can run Linux windows and terminal tools somewhat seemless on your Guest operating system.  It's not perfect but can be a little easier.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinux tools you need from aptitude\n=========\n`build-essential`\n`autoreconf4`\n`mencoder`\n`git`\n`ffmpeg`\n`imagemagick`\n\n\nLinux tools you need from github\n=====================\n[Gif Lossy](https://github.com/pornel/giflossy) !IMPORTANT follow the directions but you don't need to install this to your operating system.  At the `make` step, just run that and not `make install` (DON'T DO THIS, YOU DON'T NEED IT!)\n\n\nStep 1\n====\nCombining videos  \n`mencoder -nosub -ovc x264 -oac mp3lame cont_rec/*.MP4 -o cont_rec.mp4 -v`\nI put all of my continuous record video files in a directory called `cont_rec` and I recommend doing something similar as thinkware makes one video per minute.  Five hours of recording (about 6 hours of recording) is 300 videos (give or take).\n\n`-nosub` strips off subtitles which is important because ThinkWare encodes your impact/g-force sensor values as well as GPS coordinates (one every 10 seconds it looks like).\n\n`-ovc x264` re-encodes the MP4 created videos into a format that ffmpeg can work with.  I have tried most of the others and found ffmpeg flips the fuck out or mangles the merged video into a useless mess.\n\n`-oac mp3lame` isn't necessary but copies and re-encodes the audio along as well.  If you don't intend to or want to keep the audio, `-tv noaudio` will strip off the audio which can speed up the process.\n\nbe warned that merging the videos can take a painfully long time (Almost 12 hours or more if you don't have a lot of RAM, slow harddrive, or basic CPU).\n\nNote: If you are a ffmpeg guru, mencoder isn't need, but otherwise I ended up using this because ffmpeg was being an asshole and kept freaking the fuck out on me; lost frame, mangled frames, or it would just say screw this.\n\n\nStep 2\n====\nIntermediate stage  \nThere are \"better\" ways to do this but I found that taking still images from the merged video provides a lot more control and higher quality.  Make a new subdirectory called `summary` which you're going to fill with still images.  \n\n`fmpeg -i cont_rec.mp4 -vf fps=1/60 summary/img%03d.png`\n\nNOTE! `-vf fps=1/60` says to take a still image every minute.  For examples of what the various other products look like check these out.  This was my drive from Billings Wyoming to Denver   \n[1/240 or every 4 minutes http://imgur.com/a/RE4z6](http://imgur.com/a/RE4z6)   \n[1/120 or every 2 minutes http://imgur.com/a/12XSQ](http://imgur.com/a/12XSQ)  \n[1/60 or one fame a minute https://imgur.com/luwPceF](https://imgur.com/luwPceF)  \n\nStep 3 - merging your stills into a gif\n=====\n`convert -delay 5 -loop 0 summary/*.png summary/animated.gif`  \n`-delay` is a tricky value, all of the example gifs above were `24`.   It is is measure of 1/100th a second so 24 is television speeds\nIncreasing or decreasing that number can have sometime drastic changes. \n\nNote!  In my case, 383 png frames is almost a 1:1 of number of images to megabytes.  In my case that is a `359.5` Megabyte gif.\n\nRECOMMENDATION - I found a delay of 1 gets the best product.\n\n\nStep 4 - But mah fake points!\n===================\n\nAnything above 200MB will be rejected by imgur, so we got to bring that size down.  `giflossy` to the rescue.\n\n\nIn my case I did a `git clone` of giflossy into a subdirectory in my account's ~ (home) directory and after building it, I used that tool via this command line.\n\n`~/tools/giflossy/src/gifsicle -O3 --lossy=20 -o summary/lt1_l20_animated.gif summary/t1_animated.gif`\n\n\nFor reference are two versions of the above gifs.  http://imgur.com/a/7ggnK The top one is 1 frame a minute extracted from the merged video with a delay of 1 while the bottom is 1 frame every four minutes with a delay of 24.  Respectively they are both 119MB.   Increasing the number of lossy does drop the size down BUT it gets a bit freaky once you go above 80, if you have the time to mess around, `--lossy 240` or higher is a hilarious smudge.\n\n\nQuestions\n======\n\nI realize not everyone grew up on a v220 terminal (or emulated terminal vs telnet).  If something isn't clear or you're not sure where to start, just comment a question.\n\n\nEdits\n===\n\nDamn, realized I mangled the post title.  Adding quick tl'dr to top\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

            "selftext": "I needed to do some work in a live environment, and chose to use multiple to see how they compare. I went for Ubuntu Untiy 17.04, Linux Mint Cinnamon 18.2, and Manjaro Gnome 2017.09.10. Hardware used for the test: Ryzen 5, 8 GB ram, RX-560, wired internet, UHD monitor and USB 2.0 thumb drives.\n\n* Downloading the iso\n\nWith Ubuntu, and Mint, this went smooth. Ubuntu did ask for a donation, but I don't mind they do. Manjaro lacked fast mirrors, resulting in a download time of over an hour.\n\n* Booting\n\nUbuntu booted into an ncurses screen, which was easy to navigate. I was more suprised to see ncurses in 2017.\n\nMint had an 8 second timer before it booted. I don't no whether it was doing something I don't know, or whether it had the timer was there for no reason. My educated guess is the second.\n\nManjaro booted into a screen which allowed you to set language and locale settings. I was suprised to see this screen, but it is definately useful.\n\n* Mounting hard drives\n\nThere were 3 hard drives to mount. The first was formatted as ntfs. The second contained multiple partitions. The third was ecrypted and required a key file to unlock.\n\nUbuntu mounted the first drive correctly automatically. With the second drive, it mounted the wrong partition, and did not allow me to navigate to the right partition without doing some chown'ing from the command line.\n\nLinux Mint did not mount any of the drives automatically for some reason. It was possible to mount them from the command line.\n\nManjaro mounted the first two drives correctly.\n\nNon of the distro's mounted the encrypted drive correctly. Ubuntu and Manjaro did ask for a password to decrypt it, but they did not allow a key-file. On all of the distro's the third hard drive could be mounted from the command line.\n\n* Watching a video\n\nFirst Ubuntu. When Canonical switched to snap packages, they really screwed up video's in a live environment. I spent an hour trying to get it to work, but failed. Nothing worked: The snap store, apt-get, vlc's install guide, installing dependencies. This was my first encounter with snap packages, and I hope that Canonical either fixes this mess they created, or go back to a more common package format.\n\nLinux Mint. On Mint, the right codecs weren't installed, but the media player offered to install the packages for me. Click twice on OK, restart the video player and the video's played the way they should.\n\nOn Manjaro, video's worked out of the box.\n\n* Browsing the internet\n\nUbuntu failed to play video's. Since a lot of websites depend on video's, the browsing experience wasn't too smooth.\n\nMint worked fine, although Firefox did crash twice, and needed to be restarted. I used Firefox for a much longer time on Mint than on the other distro's, so that could also be a cause of those crashes.\n\nOn Manjaro everything worked fine again.\n\n* Other things I noted\n\nUbuntu got stuck upon shutting down.\n\nWhen copying a lot of files on Manjaro, I needed to type the sudo password every 5 minutes to keep the transfer going.\n\n* Conclusion\n\nUbuntu used to have a very good live environment. Today it feels like it has been neglected for years. I would not recommend.\n\nThis was the first time I used the Linux Mint live environment, and it worked pretty well. Everything that didn't work was easily fixable.\n\nManjaro has been working hard on their live environment for the last couple of years. Yes, there is still room for improvement, but I would say that it was the best of the three.",

I've only tested it so far on an Ubuntu system, so it should at least work on Debian likes. However, the sessions are read from '/usr/share/xsessions', which I'm not sure if it is portable. Currently there is also no parameter to change that, it is hardcoded. The goal is to provide a simple \"login manager\"-like experience which can be used from a tty.\n\nFeedback in all shapes and colors is welcome, obviously.\n\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nIdeally x-session-selector can be used as barebones login manager from a tty. The usecase would be:\n\n    $ xsessionselector\n\n 1. System does not start a graphical session by default, stays at the tty prompt.\n 2. User logs in, x-session-selector is started automatically and presents the user with the list of available sessions/window managers.\n 3. User selects one and the X11 session is started, or the user chooses to be dropped to the shell.\n\nAdditionally, one can specify to select an entry automatically which will be selected after a specified time if the user does not intervene.\n\n    $ xsessionselector -a3 -s/usr/bin/openbox\n\nFor testing purposes, it also supports only printing the selected value without actually starting it, which is useful for debugging and testing purposes.\n\n    $ xsessionselector -o\n\nBy default, the next free X session and the same virtual terminal is used, but they can also be specified with parameters:\n\n    $ xsessionselector -d:3 -v12\n\nThis will start an X session with the number \":3\" on the 12th virtual terminal.\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nThe source is licensed under GPLv3.\n\n\nDownload\n--------\n\nYou can fetch the [0.1 build from GitLab](https://gitlab.com/RobertZenz/x-session-selector/tags/v0.1).\n",

In windows I have a short cut key set up to speak what ever text I have high lighted using Microsoft's Zira voice. The best sounding voice IMO. Well I finally came up with a solution, and because I re-install more often than I should and my memory doesn't work worth a damn I decided to share it here in the hopes I'll come across it when I forget how I did in the in the first place.\n\n\nThe Solution.\nIt was surprisingly simple.\nDownload the 32bit version of SpeechPlatformRuntime.msi from https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=27225 and MSSpeech_TTS_en-US_ZiraPro.msi from https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=27224 this should work with the other voices as well.\n\n\n    $export WINEARCH=win32\n    $export WINPREFIX=~/.wine32\n    $winetricks msxml3\n    $wine msiexec /i SpeechPlatformRuntime.msi\n    $wine msiexec /i MSSpeech_TTS_en-US_ZiraPro.msi\n\n\nafter that you should be able to use any windows tts program that uses Microsoft Speech Platform v11. I use Balabolka's Command Line Utility http://www.cross-plus-a.com/bconsole.htm it's a simple console app and doesn't require any extra dependencies.\n\n\n\nI typed this up mostly from memory so other dependencies may be required.",

I really want to take this a step further and make Linux my career. But I don't know where to start.\n\nA career I keep seeing popup time and time again is Software Engineer. Now I've dabbled in Python, C, Java etc but what kind of software do Software Engineers typically make? Are they applications, library extensions and how could I learn to make something that specific? The things I've written don't even come close to that. The stuff I wrote were fun, little experiments I made in my spare time to amuse myself. One in particular was a lightning generator I wrote in Java which randomly generated streaks of lightning and that's all it did. I'm sure you see my point, the things I wrote had no real practical use to them and I don't know how to write things that have practicality in their design.\n\nAnother Career I see a lot is Systems Administrator. Now I don't know exactly what a systems adminstrator does, but they seem to be managers of a given network, maintaining it, making sure it's as stable as physically possible. How could I learn systems adminstration since I don't really have a network I could practice on.\n\nLastly there's Penetration Tester, now this is the career I know the least about but it looks interesting, having people pay you to see how secure their network is. From what I understand you make your own VMs to practice penetrating.\n\nAnyway, these are just my thoughts as I don't really know where to start. If you guys could answer some of my questions and/or point me in the right direction regarding training/practice for one of these careers I'd really appreciate it. Thank you all for your time.\n",

            "selftext": "Hello all, I had an awesome day today. I have been using Linux from 6 years but I had a little chance of introducing Linux to people who are stuck with outdated and pirated copies of Windows especially people who love Windows XP and have no knowledge beyond that. \n\nI have such a family. In my area, very little people who know about Linux. Even if someone do, they do not like it to the point to use it for home usage. They think it as hard commandline stuff and something they will never want themselves to get in. \n\nSo coming to the actual happenings. 2 weeks ago, I had to happen a visit to my uncle who have been using Windows XP on two really old Dell desktops. One of their machine is Dell Optiplex G270 who have 1GB of RAM and Intel Pentium 4. Other machine is also Dell P4. My uncle has been a hobbiest photographer from a very long period eversince I have been 12-13. (I am 22 now). That makes ~10 years. He had all those pictures he had taken from his Canon camera spanned over 10 years of time saved on those two PCs. Therefore, you can expect that he is very careful about his collection of all those images. Moving forward, my uncle decided to show me his collection of photographs and he showed all my childhood collection he had. Those were amazing photographs and bring out those memories I had not remembered them in a long period. While browsing those photographs he had to wait almost every second to let Windows XP recover from hang. I saw all those troubles he had been facing to just view those JPEG images. I felt bad about it and I decided to give them try about a new \"Windows\" I have which is super fast and virus free. \n\nMy uncle has been cautious about his data so he rarely does anything other than viewing their photographs or moving pictures between camera which he has still at the moment working very well. I asked him to change his Windows because current OS is almost another virus. For example Firefox.exe doesn't exist. Tons of NewFolder.exe files everywhere. Hidden folders and etc. He said he does not feel right about it because his data is spread all over hard drive including partition of os. He also had an incident where he lost a tons of picture when he did install a fresh Windows XP from some other tech guy. He feared for his photographs. I understood his reasons. I told him that I have a special kind of \"Windows\" who you can run without installing or affecting your current Windows XP direct through USB. He looked in disbelieve but said ok, he will have a look. I left his home and came back to my home. \n\n2 weeks passed and after searching lighweight Linux based operating systems, I decided to give try to Xebian (Debian Unstable + XFCE: Reason is Qupzilla web browser who works well on lightweight systems). I went to meet him and I had already made a bootable USB from which I ran the os. \n\nAt first, boot was a little slow. I was patient and my uncle sat near to me looking at all those boot commands appearing at booting process.  He did not bother to ask about them. Finally,  desktop with XFCE was infront. Now, I could show all the magic and power. \n\nI showed him all the basic view and told him that \"Home\" is equivalent of \"My Computer\" and told him that everything this computer holds in all these disks which are present on desktop. He asked me to open them and I opened the folders one by one. He asked me to show photos and all was opened smoothly. He asked for media and it also went smooth like butter. At that point he was amazed at the speed every little thing was being done. I also told him that there is no refresh, refresh, refresh thing or virus concept (I do know, Linux is not absolute virus free but for him to understand and appreciate virus free environment i said so). He was happy that there is no anti-virus thing anymore. I also told him that all his favorite programs comes preinstalled so he does not need to do anything. Firefox is there, PDF files which my uncle love to read and have lots of them were opened like butter made him so happy about it. I also told him that there are no need to do a driver for everything so just enjoy your machine. He loved everything I told him about and I appreciated all those people who worked upon Linux to made it what it is now. *Thank you to all*. \nIn the end, he said he needs to move his data to secure location after which I should install them a Linux and I did tell him this OS is not Windows but called Linux in general and its name is Debian. \n\nTL;DR: My uncle had a first taste of Linux and he loved it.

So you either need to spend the time to maintain the overlay of that software, or you sit and wait and hope for someone else to pick it up. Meanwhile, since Debian is so common through all the various Ubuntu spinoffs, Debian has lots of support for even the most odd pieces of software. However, I really strongly prefer the rolling release model. \n\nI was looking around a bit at various distributions and Kali Linux strikes me as putting out a good offer, even though I am not into penetration testing.

I get it's playlist-based format, but it just isn't for me. On windows I used a music player called Dopamine, which I really liked. I was wondering, is there a similar music player for Linux that you know of? What player do you use?\n\nI prefer FLOSS software, but if it's *essential*, I might be persuaded to dirty my computer with proprietary software.\n\nPS: I'm not sure if this violates R1, but I saw other software recommendation threads, so I gave it a go.\n\nEdit:  \nAfter looking through some of your great suggestions, I've come to a better understanding of what I look for in a music player (rather than like *x*, or not like *y*). My killer features are:  \n- A clean design (dark theme is a big plus)  \n- Front-and-centre playback controls  \n- Large and central album art (this is how I usually look for albums at a glance)  \n- Focus on playing albums, rather than playlists.\n\nThanks for your help so far!",

            "selftext": "So longtime Gnome user. Finally sick of it. These are a small selection of problems with gnome:\n\n1. Poor architecture from the core. Plugins are not isolated, out of date plugins can take down your whole system easily.  Doing everything from not allowing GnomeTweaks to even open, to segfaulting inside glib, to *insert rage*.\n\n1. No plugin hotloading.\n\n1. Wayland session sucks still.  Any crash in gnome-shell kills all your open apps, and trust me crashes happen VERY often still even with the latest Gnome/Mutter gfx drivers and linux kernel.\n\n1. Poor architecture does not allow a reload now in Wayland session.  To update/add a plugin you need kill all your open windows by logging out. \n\n3. Breaking api changes.  It seems gnome leaders do not believe in deprecation. Constantly breaking a ton of working plugins because they removed an API instead of deprecating it.  Often the removal of the API causes crash log spam which results on crashes in glib (the crash logger particularly) which segfaults from spamming to the crash log.\n\nSo rant over. My question is this, are there any stable DE stacks?  What about XFCE or KDE?\n\nI just want 2 basic features.  #1 if something near the core crashes I dont want to lose all my open windows. #2 I don't want the entire DE to freeze on me randomly every 1-3 days, and if it does, I want to be able to recover from it. #3 A feature/plugin to manage virtual workspaces like this one https://github.com/passingthru67/workspaces-to-dock/raw/master/Screenshot.png, so I can see all my virtual workspaces and the windows they have open inside them to the right side of my single screen laptop.\n\nAlso a sidenote I feel Ubuntu is doomed unless they start pushing patches to Gnome, Mutter, Wayland session related things and more.  Gnome as a DE is simply not stable enough to be a DE.\n\nEDIT: Insight I have gained so far:\n\n1. Arch + Gnome is the recommended experience. (Rolling releases)\n1. If you use Gnome, follow WOGUE (duh!)\n1. With 17.10 Ubuntu using Gnome, 1m+ users will be reporting bugs\n1. KDE crashes just as much\n1. AwesomeWM is an interesting option if it works for your workflow.\n1. XFCE is rock solid.",

There is an OAuthToken stored, but no associated mail address or whatever stored. \n\nMaybe we can figure this out together. Since i currently have no access to a Linux machine, i cannot tell if it is even possible to complete the login process solely via wine, without the need of importing a Registry Key. \n\nAs soon as i have access to a linux machine (i am at work right now, but thinking of building a quick VM) i will investigate further - but maybe someone else has done some research as well?",

(which way is the least worrysome for long-term in terms of operating costs?). Does nmcli with static IP bring any advantages over the classic setup? Should I worry about side effects of removing n-m from system?\n\n(Edit: I've never got any further with n-m than disabling it for an interface (NM_CONTROLLED=no in ifcfg-* file) or simply removing it. I use mostly debian/ubuntu minimal installs all over for servers (which implies no n-m), and use non-linux as a desktop, so haven't got a chance to spend more time learning n-m)\n\nThank you!",

Debian provide security updates for all packages. If hole is found, they fix it. There is only one problem. It's not beginner friendly, however few distros: MX Linux, antiX, LMDE, SolydX which are Debian Stable based are perfect for beginners.

Yes I know nearly impossible on a multi core system :D\n\nI've looked at taking the 5 minute average and dividing it by the number of cores. E.g. if load average is 1.25 on 4 core system that is a ~31% usage. However... we all know load average takes into account I/O wait, disk etc.\n\nI've looked at top -b, but that seems really strangely inaccurate.\n\nmpstat -P ALL\ncombine all the %idle values / CPU cores - 100.\n\nAny thoughts on what might be the best approach. I feel mpstat and using the idle value is the best but it always seems to low.\n\nThanks for your thoughts and comments!",

            "selftext": "I'm thinking no, but that's not the fault to Linux being bloated, 10 years ago, I would agree Linux could bring life into older hardware that had 512MB of RAM (the minimum requirement for Vista that was still garbage) or less and back then, the most bloated thing you had to worry about on a computer was the OS and to this day, Vista is the most bloated OS that swiftly became obsolete because later versions of Windows were a superset of Vista.\n\nBut, it's not the OS that's bloated anymore, it's the whole web. I only have 4GB of RAM on my machine and I switched to IceWM because I kept on crashing with Skype and Firefox open.\n\nI say it doesn't \"bring new life into older hardware\" because most of what people do is browse the web and that needs a good computer these days because HTML5 is so feature rich and resource intensive, it's worse than Flash in some ways and HTML5 is GPU accelerated and GPU acceleration performs best on a platform with the best drivers.\n\nI don't mean to spread FUD, but can we call this a myth now that was true in the past? Kinda like just taking your hard drive with your Linux install from computer to computer and it working. Yes it worked \"the last time I tried it\", but the last time I tried it was years ago and I think the only distro that will work for is Slackware.\n\n\nEdit: I guess I'll give Linux a bone and say AMD/ATI FOSS drivers mature over time and would be good for an inexpensive steam machine for indie games and old DX9 games. A few years ago, I ran Oblivion in Wine and I could have sworn it ran better in Linux than in Windows 7, but that's a very rare case and DX9 is like 15-year-old technology, so it is what it is.",

            "selftext": "I am using Kubuntu 17.04 here, and I mainly use Chromium as my browser. In most programs, when I click on a link, Chromium is opened.\n\nBut then I was surprised why some programs opened Firefox (which I use separately as a testing ground for some web stuff).\n\nIt turns out that xdg-open is mainly used (which is good), but there are *other* ways how to open a browser. There's the Debian alternatives system, which sets symlinks. And there are *two*: gnome-www-browser and x-www-browser . A program may use one or the other. And they can individually point to any browser.\n\n*Yet another* method of opening a browser can be found in the sensible-utils package. It falls back on the gnome-www-browser , then the x-www-browser symlink, but this is how the implementation currently looks like, meaning future versions could do it in a different way.\n\nSo I had to modify these two alternatives to *also* point to Chromium.\n\nAnd it does not end there. Firefox and Thunderbird apparently ignore xdg-open and use some other filetype association system. I lost count on how often for example I tried to open a PDF in Thunderbird and its insane filetype association system decided that the default application should be ... Gimp. Or Inkscape. For *opening a PDF*.\n\nWorse, while it is possible to manually force Firefox/Thunderbird to use xdg-open, it is not fully doable. In Firefox, the list of downloads allows for opening said downloads, but apparently uses *yet another* filetype association list. (This by the way is another reason why I prefer Chromium - its filetype association is actually correct.)\n\nThis type of insanity is still endemic on Linux desktops. Any filetype association system other than xdg-open *must not* be integrated into a desktop distro like Ubuntu. Everything must use the exact same system, and force this with patches if necessary. Windows got this right *decades* ago, and Windows has so many problems of its own. It is frankly embarrassing that something as simple as filetype association is broken in 2017.",

The supply is naturally more than the demand, or in other words, we have reached a saturation.\n\nAs a linux enthusiast, how do you feel about it? Though linux is far from the danger of being a closed source product (because GPL and all), its distant cousin android is perhaps not. We already know that android is open source only in theory - all OEMs make drastic changes to kernel at the hardware level that is not always shared with the public. Its also well known that though Google tries to market itself as open source friendly, in reality its not - Chrome, Gmail, PlayStore and a bunch of other things are still proprietary.\n\nSo, as independent developers (who also contribute to open source occasionally), what should our strategy be from now onward?",

The caption below the chart of results: \"Windows Desktop was the most commonly used platform by developers, followed by Linux Desktop.\" So, this is a confusing mix of development platforms and runtime platforms.\n\nIn the 2017 \"Platforms\" results, Windows has 41%, Linux Desktop has 32.9% and MacOs 18.9%. \n\nObviously, it would have been very easy and straightforward to ask specifically what kind of operating system the developers themselves use ([just like in 2016 survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2016)) and ask for the runtime / target platform separately.\n\nIf we only take the desktop share results from the 2017 survey and compare them to the 2016 results, the relative changes:\n\n* Windows: 52.4% -> 41% = ~ 20% loss\n* OSX/macOS: 26.2% -> 18.4% = ~30% loss\n* Linux Desktop: 21.7% -> 32.9% = ~50% gain\n\nTinfoil hat on: Maybe it would have been embarrassing for Apple and Microsoft that developers are mass-migrating to Linux so \"nicely\" asked for a less obvious result.\n",

            "selftext": "Hi all.  I'm using Ubuntu Gnome quite happily and I love its overview, hot corners, and dock/topbar management (with extensions).  It's perfect for my Laptop workflow.  Because I'm a Linux user and also have FOMO, I've been watching all of the Budgie excitement.  I love listening to Ikey on his podcast and following his Solus and Budgie work and want his efforts to succeed and have donated to Solus.  I'm salivating over everything I read him post as to where he wants to take Budgie, so I *want* to love it, but after playing with it on a VM for a while, I'm not feeling it.  I'm wondering if I'm missing something.\n\nDon't get me wrong.  It's slick, and attractive, and quite snappy, even in VM.  With the new top bar options, it's really quite configurable too.  It's also been rock solid, not one bug.  But, I'm reading online of people ditching their other DE's for it all over the place, and I'm not getting why.  If you're happily using XFCE, KDE, Gnome, MATE, etc, I'm not sure why you'd switch.  I can't find a compelling differentiator.  It feels like a tyranny of small differences thing, the usual Linux DE  elements just slightly reconfigured.  The biggest reason I could think switching is if you're wanting a snappy, light-weight DE (whatever that means anymore) and want a tighter and more updated DE than XFCE or something more modern feeling than stock MATE.  \n\nSo, this is a long-winded way to ask, if you've moved to Budgie as your daily DE, why have you done so and what is it doing for you that your prior DE choice wasn't?  How is it better for your workflow?  \n\nAnd I'm speaking solely of the DE on Ubuntu here, not Solus vs other distros.  Thanks!",

This needs that application inhibits power management though (chromium does that).  \n\nNearly everything is configurable through config file.\nRemember that clight won't [eat your battery](https://github.com/FedeDP/Clight#will-it-eat-my-battery)!\n\nClight works thanks to a bus service i developed together with it: [clightd](https://github.com/FedeDP/Clightd).  \nClightd gained support for polkit, some new exposed methods and lots of cleanups/improvements.  \n\nI hope someone finds them useful :)  \nAnd obviously, i hope this second post about them was not annoying.",

The issue I am having is that Guake (a drop-down terminal) isn't actually dropping down as it is fading in/out. I contacted the Guake devs and they said Guake has not settings for this as it is controlled by the window manager. \r\rHow do modify Gnome3 so that the window drops down instead of fading in/out?",
