Not a huge issue I've found some api's that I can use to handle this sort of thing and should be able to program it pretty easily.\n\nI'm currently doing info gathering and layout for this one.

            "selftext": "The main concern to begin a career in Cybersecurity is understanding how to start. Internet is a wonderful media, but having access to so much information with no control is like having no access at all. What path could provide the tools to become a self-sufficient Security expert in the shortest time? I imagine plenty of wannabe professionals living the same discomfort, feeling completely alone between thousands of Subject Experts.\n\nWhen I first stumbled upon Security, it was trough \u201cCaesar Cipher\u201d. For me, it seemed the most exciting thing in the world and that day I decided I would have spent all my time unveiled all secrets behind Cybersecurity. Unfortunately, life has taken me on different paths, too far from the object of my ambition. I had two options: to accept it or fight for it! How easy would my life be had I been able to let things go. \n\nHow could I steer it again in the right direction? I remember myself analyzing plenty of CVs to find out what path other people had followed to get where they were. They must have started from somewhere, right? Maybe if I had been able to mimic their choices I would have arrived there, too. Finally, my eye fell onto an unknown certification: **eLearnSecurity Certified Professional Penetration Tester (eCPPT)**. Never heard of it! I found out a colleague of mine had already completed it and strongly suggested me to try. Buzzwords like \u201cpractical\u201d, \u201clabs\u201d, \u201chands-on\u201d were still echoing in my mind. So, I bought it. No trials, no reviews, just faith in work relationships, the foundation to become Security professionals. \n\nMy impressions in brief:\n\n- **CHEAP:** I could afford it. That\u2019s it! InfoSec certifications usually assume your organization would pay for them, but this is not the case and I think trade-off cost-benefits is really worth a try.\n\n- **EXHAUSTIVE:** The course includes everything you need to start your Cybersecurity career. Divided into 5 modules (Web, Network, System, Metasploit and WiFi), it offers PDFs, videos, codes and any kind of additional material to ease the learning process as much as possible. It felt like owning a personal library always available and ready to be consulted. Additionally, some of provided knowledges (such as Shellcoding or Buffer Overflow) are totally enabling to other Security advanced certifications and topics.\n\n- **SELF-SUFFICIENT:** No particular previous knowledge is required. The course does not take anything for granted and effectively explain all requirements needed to completely understand discussed topics with an impressive level of detail. The overall feeling is that nothing is there for no reason. \n\n- **PRACTICAL:** Labs, labs, labs and labs again. Paper-Security is not effective if not put into practice. What did Beckett say? \u201cEver tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try Again. Fail again. Fail better.\u201d\n\n- **APPEALING:** The course offers a perfect balance between text and graphics, in the idea that visual representation is a better way to pin concepts than hundreds of words.\n\nBetween the infinity of tools and certifications, I will always remember eCPPT course as the first true step I have taken in my professional career. What really gave me the self-confidence to try mastering this complex and deep subject. \n\nSecurity is all about knowledge and experience. Mostly important, security is a method where everyone can give a real contribution in his own way. No shortcuts. No definite roads. Only knowledge and confidence. Do not take anything for granted; deepen, contaminate, learn, trust in yourself, with a clear idea of the direction you intend to take.\n\nIt won\u2019t be easy. You can decide to give up or try. Your choice.",

With C0m80 You will be required to log in locally in the VirtualBox console window at some point. This, I know, may 'rile' some of the purists out there that say you should be able to compromise a boot2root fully remotely over a network.\n\nI agree to that in principle, and in this case I had intended to allow vnc or xrdp access. Alas, due to compatibility problems I had to make a compromise in this area in order to get the challenge published sooner rather than later.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt should be obvious at what point you need to log in. So when that time comes just pretend you are using remote desktop. ;D\n\n\nSorry, I hope you can forgive me. \u00a0\n\n\nDifficulty Rating\n\n[Difficult]\u00a0\n\nbut depends on you really\n\n\nGoal\u00a0\n\nThere is only one goal here.

One guy I messed around with let me know that \"he\" could see what I'm doing, who I talk to, where I go\". I use headphones a lot while working and I have a bad habit of talking to myself, one guy makes a habit of reciting these things back to me via Facebook, sometimes even personally, the same with my phone diary. I've switched phones, however, it seems as if I'm still being monitored, as the guy still likes to casually repeat what I say or do on my phone. I'm not sure, how or why, since the new phone never had the chance of being in someone else's hands. \nI know this is a space for hacking, but exactly how is this happening and how can I protect myself from it?",

The Internet is truly the wild west. \n\nWhat do you think, should hacking back be legalized? If so, should corporations be given a \"Sheriff's Badge\" while individuals lose more sovereignty?

So I got hacked and a couple of my things have been tampered with, like Playstation, Amazon, and Steam to name three. I've been dealing with these and others as they come and taking steps to prevent others, which has been fine, but tonight, the hacker used my Skype to talk to one of my friends, who's a woman and tbh she's pretty good looking. I'm really pissed that this guy took to trying to get to my friends, I was ok with him messing with me and me dealing with it, but this is another level. Is there a way I can have Skype track the IP that contacted my friend and find out where this guy is coming from? Or will Skype not do that sort of thing because privacy/corporate bs?",

And that's why I'm asking for help.\n\nDoes anyone know about some articles from reputable magazines, books or already made thesises/essays about wargames? Or any other books/arcticles/essays that could be relevant, and that I can use as reference literature when submitting the work? My BT supervisor is really into the topic and is basically rooting for me, so the only issue is to get the Thesis through the rest of the university application process.\n\nAlso, if anyone knows about some more backend blogs or articles dealing with how to make a wargame, I would love to hear about them, even if they are not from reputable source.\n\nThanks a bunch for help, I'm really exited for this project, and would love to do the best job I can on it. I plan to Open Source the wargame, so it's not only going to server to get me my Bachelors Degree, but also makes the world of security a little bit more accessible for newcomers \\^\\_\\^.\n\nAlso, I would be glad for any kind of information about the topic that you think could help me.

Of course, my realvnc.com pw was too weak, and of course, I used the same pw to both computers.  But I don't understand how he was able to hack my realvnc.com account.  I mean I only signed up two weeks ago.  How would he know my account existed?\n\nAfterward I noticed my home computer was no longer apart of my team and was instead somehow part of the hackers temporary team not tied to my realvnc.com account but instead an account with a Professional Subscription under a trial that expired in 30 days, so I assume he had just created the account.\n\nNeedless to say I'm very leery of using any VNC products going forward.\n\nOh, and he went to paypal.com on my browser (which auto logged in) and sent himself $1500 before I was able to shut him down.  Fun.\n\nTIA",

When it went back up my Mac couldn't even connect because my MAC Address was blocked. So I decided to boot in Mac and then spoof my mac and that works, unfortunately, it's only spoofing it and not actually chaning it, and it won't change on the windows side of things. I can't go up to the network admin and say something because then they will know I was trying to steal peoples passwords. All help is appreciated, and yes I understand I shouldn't have done what I did, but I can't change the past and now I can't connect to the internet without spoofing my Mac address. I want to be able to run Windows again. Also, I know it is a ban because it works fine on other WiFi's and it also works when I change it. \n\nHELP ME!",

I flashed a GL-AR150 with the pineapple firmware from GitHub, located here: https://github.com/SecurityAddicted/pineapple-ar150\n\nThe firmware upgrade worked, went to 100%, I can successfully ping the portable router and get replies, I can still access the internet via this portable router, but I cannot access the web GUI of the portable router anymore since upgrading to the pineapple firmware, I also cannot SSH into the device to give it commands to try and fix the issue, since it asks me for a password obviously and the password I used when I edited the password for the portable router before upgrading it, doesn't work, also the default factory settings password doesn't work either. I suspect it's bricked? Even though it works perfect except I cannot access the GUI anymore, has anyone had any experience with this? If so, how could I go about fixing this? If it's bricked I don't think it can be fixed, I did everything correct according to my knowledge when I flashed it and apparently this firmware wasn't a lemon, since I found it from multiple guides online.\n\nIf this is the wrong subreddit for this question, could someone possibly point me to the right one? I couldn't find any other subreddit that seemed suitable for this question besides this one.\n\nCheers.",

It gave me this: https://imgur.com/a/jQnlW And thats as much as i can show without giving away the ip. What are the odds that the \"attack\" actually came from there? If thats not enough details ill happily send the ip via pm, if you think you can help out.

Okay so my school gives us all our own personal account to log on with since we're on a different computer every time, but that means that if I save something on the desktop or install a google extension, it won't be there unless I log onto the same computer again... is there any way to make it so it's there no matter what computer I go on.\n\n3. I want to install winrar on the computer but again, I need admin permission and I can't get that... how do I install it?\n\n4. How do I make it so I cannot be tracked by the school IT while doing this.... since I would get in trouble if they found out...\n\n5. Our school made it so we cannot access things like display settings, command prompt, run, ect. Any way to fix that?\n\nThat's all, all help is appreciated, thank you very much\n\nAlso looking for a mentor to guide me into the world of hacking and programming, if anyone's got the time, please show me how to do things :)",

So that means if the scammer left a review it would be easy to find out his fiverr username then see if he posted reviews on the other fiverr testimonals videos that he paid for to confirm that is him, also it looks like he was russian from the text used on some of his crappy screenshots, see this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Sr9phViNU\n\nWould be interesting to see if we could locate the russian ip address, or get his fiverr email, name, etc. seems like an interesting story.\n\n",

I have a raspberry pi 2 with two external wifi adapters, and gps connected via USB, and a system currently set to run the kismet_server and gpsd at boot. It is able to log properly and output said files to a location of my choice\n\nI also have a small TFT display for it that I would like to find a way to display this kismet data on a real-time map of my current location.\n\nI am aware of converting the log files into another format readable by google maps and importing them into there, but I am specifically wanting a real time updating system. So that when I am walking and new networks are discovered, they are able to immediately pop up on the map being displayed on the TFT screen. \n\nMy thoughts were it may be possible to write a script to end a session after x minutes, merge the logs into one, and then import it to my mapping applications after x minutes as well. This seems to be slowed time and not really meeting the \"real-time\" feature. \n\nAny suggestions on how to go about accomplishing this? Thanks",

There were some people who knew what I wrote down on my computer privately - things I didn't post on the internet, just on my computer using notepad or wordpad. And they seemed to know my every internet history, such as when I logged on to Reddit, what kind of email I received, etc.\n\n\n\nI think it's some form of hacking but I want to know how it's possible. Is it some remote control thing? And what step can I take from now on and I read \"never click anything that looks suspicious\", but I'm not sure how large the range is. Does the non click thing include all news articles and internet posts or just links and the likes? Thanks in advance.\n\n\n\nEdit: Oh, and one important detail I forgot to write. I was very meticulous about my computer so I didn't install anything on my computer except for Microsoft Update programs and I reinstall Windows very frequently to prevent this particular type of accident.

I wasn't paying any attention to their purses but apparently, someone left a phone (Samsung Galaxy S3) inside of one of my friend purse. We just noticed that today.\n\nIts pattern blocked and I don't know if is possible to bypass it, but its a pretty extrange scenario, why someone would leave a perfectly working phone in someone else purse? I want to figure out the pattern so I can check if it was a mistake and maybe I can some contact info to give it back.\n\nWould you guys please help?\n",

Can this be abused as a phishing technique?

A buddy of mine wanted to show me a picture that was in one of his USB flash drives. When he opened up the contents of the drive, it was empty and nothing showed up. He then went to the windows file explorer search bar thing at the top right and typed in \"*\". Suddenly, all the folders showed up.

I don't have any formal training per se, but I've worked with computers my entire life and consider myself pretty knowledgeable in terms of network structure and the like. A concern as of late has been the family life of a tester. I have a wife and kid and I'm noticing that I have to dedicate a lot of time in front of the screen to learn these skills. Lately it has taken a toll on family time and I feel bad about it. So, for those professional pentesters with a similar family structure as mine, how is your family life? Do you have time for kids and wife? Or do you feel a daily guilt for dedicating so much time on the computer?",

How would this compare to a 6 digit passcode?\n\nAlso if this 4 digit passcode is protecting a system, but you have 3 tries before you are locked out for 24 hours, what's the point of having a passcode longer that 4 digits?\n\nI am not asking for help on how to hack a system protected by a 4 digit passcode. Do not tell me how to do it, I don't want you to get banned and I dont want to get banned myself.\n\nAnd what's the point of passwords if we can use a 4 digit passcode?

            "selftext": "I have a Tp-Link TDW8951ND router that kept getting smashed. Originally I had some issues as a result of the rom-0 attack, but adding some ACL rules and locking down the WAN interface and gui seemed to do the trick. With the use of misfortune cookie it is possible to remove authentication from the router regardless of these ACL rules as port 7547 is open. I have qualified this by running the exploit and although I cannot access the device remotely, when accessing locally no authentication is required. Strangely enough over the past few weeks it appears that the router is once again being compromised and I am struggling to understand how. I have grabbed a copy of the exploit as well as routersploit. The routersploit autopwn scanner picks up the d1000_rce exploit as being available, however when I try to run commands from the blind shell such as reboot the device does not go down. Therefore currently i can see how the attackers can remove the authentication, but I cannot see how they are removing the ACL rules and then further compromising the device. I have seen some SOAP requests where the iptables can be turned off entirely which would make sense as to how the rules are being removed, but I don't believe the dc1000_rce exploit works with this device despite it being reported so when scanning with autopwn. Has anyone seen an example of the \nthe misfortune cookie being used to strip acl rules? Just for info I know that changing the device or a firmware upgrade will fix the problems but I would much rather have a play around and learn something from these exceptionally secure devices.",

I have not tested all, I will let you peeps take care of that. \nNow that we got that out of the way, how to install kali linux ON windows without running a vm:\n\n1.\tSearch for windows insider settings on windows, you need to sign up for the windows insider program and install the latest stable build of windows to have this work as we use the beta feature \u201clinux subsystem\u201d to achieve this. \n\n2.\tAfter having installed the latest windows insider build, go into an elevated powershell and type in the command \u201cEnable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux\u201d (without the quotation marks) and click enter, now after the installation is complete type y and click enter to the restart prompt.\n\n3.\tAfter the restart open a elevated cmd windows and type in the command \u201clxrun /install /y\u201d. this will install the ubuntu base for the kali linux install with the default user as root and without password.\n\n4.\tOnce the installation is complete, go into the searchbar on windows and type in bash, you should then get a result called \u201cbash on ubuntu on windows\u201d. Open this and you should get a linux terminal which is logged into root.\n\n5.\tType in the command \u201capt-get update\u201d and then after that type in \u201capt-get dist-upgrade -y\u201d, this will update the ubuntu system and its preinstalled tools to the newest version\n\n6.\tWhen the update is complete type the command \u201capt-get install python2.7 -y\u201d and when that is finished type the command \u201cgit clone https://github.com/LionSec/katoolin.git\u201d this will download the tool that installs kali linux\n\n7.\tNow type the command \u201cpython2.7 katoolin/katoolin.py\u201d. this will start the katoolin tool. \n\n8.\tOpen the \u201cAdd Kali repositories & Update\u201d then \u201cAdd Kali linux repositories\u201d and  then \u201cupdate\u201d. Then click ctrl+c and type \u201cpython2.7 katoolin/katoolin.py\u201d again.\n\n9.\tThen go to \u201cview categories\u201d and then click 0 and enter to install all kali linux tools.\n\n10.\tOnce that finishes then you are done. You can now use all the kali linux tools. Kali linux also has direct acces to your networking so anything that requires that you connect to this install works just like a normal kali linux install.\n\nYou are now done. Tell me if you want pictures to the steps for better guidance. \n",
