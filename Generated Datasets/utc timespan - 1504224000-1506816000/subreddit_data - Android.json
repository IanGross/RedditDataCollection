Only submissions that are directly related to Android are allowed.\r\n\r\n###2. We welcome **discussion-promoting** posts that benefit the community, and not the individual.\r\n- We welcome posts that benefit the community (device reviews, guides,\r\n  discussions and rumors) and not the individual (rants, customer service\r\n  complaints, or selling/trading devices).\r\n- Low effort/\"hit and run\" posts will be removed.\r\n- Support questions, including app or phone recommendations, should go to\r\n  /r/AndroidQuestions instead.\r\n  Please submit bug reports and feature requests to the AOSP tracker.\r\n\r\n###3. Images must be in **self posts**.\r\n\r\n###4. Developer self promotion must meet these guidelines.\r\n- **Self promotion is meant for community members only**:\r\n- - Your account must be at least 3 months old.\r\n- - You must have a reasonable posting history (meaning you're an active redditor, and your posts aren't *just* to promote your app).\r\n- - You will be expected to interact with users in your thread.\r\n- - Your post must be a self post and provide a decent amount of information about your app. A few\r\n    sentences and a link won't cut it.\r\n- - Be reasonable with how often you promote your app.\r\n\r\n###5. No reposts, spam or rehosted content.\r\n- Duplicate posts on the same topic will be removed, even if it's a different\r\n  source.\r\n- For rehosted content, post the original source instead. This can usually be\r\n  found at the bottom of the article.\r\n\r\n###6. No **editorializing** titles.\r\n- In most cases, you should use the same title as the article you're posting.\r\n\r\n###7. No **piracy.**\r\n- Download unverified APKs at your own risk.\r\n\r\n###8. No **unauthorized** polls, bots or giveaways.\r\n\r\n###9. No offensive, hateful, or low-effort comments.  \r\n\r\n###10. No affiliate links.\r\n- Only non-\"deal alert\" third-party articles may contain affiliate links.\r\n\r\n#####\r\n\r\n#####[**View Detailed Rules**](/r/Android/w/rulesandregs/)  \r\n\r\n---  \r\n\r\n#AMAs  \r\n\r\nDate|Time (EST)|Person(s)|Description\r\n:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:\r\n  \r\n\r\n####[**See more upcoming AMAs**](http://goo.gl/IWIz0o)  \r\n\r\n####[**Request an AMA**](http://goo.gl/fTJz2L)  \r\n\r\n---  \r\n\r\n#Weekly Newsletter  \r\n\r\n[**Subscribe to /r/Android Weekly Newsletter**](http://goo.gl/vDLCNi#pb-android)  \r\n\r\n[**Subscribe to e-mail alerts via IFTTT**](http://goo.gl/MsZCix#if-android)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#Weekly Threads\r\nDay|Topic\r\n---|---\r\nMonday|Moronic Monday\r\nTuesday|Newsday Tuesday\r\nWednesday|Newsday Tuesday\r\nThursday|What Should I Buy \r\nFriday|Variable Weekly Discussion\r\nSaturday|Saturday APPreciation\r\nSunday|Sunday Rant/Rage\r\n\r\n[Click here for the Weekly Thread Archives](/r/MoronicMondayAndroid)  \r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n \r\n####[**Apps Wiki**](/r/Android/w/index#wiki_apps)\r\n \r\n####[**FAQs**](/r/Android/wiki/index#wiki_faqs)\r\n\r\n####[**Related Subreddits**](/r/Android/w/subreddits)\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n##Flair Icon Legend:\r\n\r\n- [Readers, add/update your own flair above!](/r/Android/wiki/flair)  \r\n\r\n- [Developers, click here to request special flair.](https://androidflair.github.io/)  \r\n\r\n| | \r\n:-----------|\r\n[](/j20sm#appdev) Individual Developer | \r\n[](/j20sm#majordev) Company Developer | \r\n[](/j20sm#romdev) Custom ROM Developer | \r\n[](/j20sm#contributor) Unaffiliated Contributor | \r\n[](/j20sm#androiddev) Official Android OS Team | \r\n[](/j20sm#themedev) Android Theme Developer | \r\n[](/j20sm#website) Android-related Website | \r\n[](/j20sm#redditdev) Reddit add-on Developer | \r\n[](/j20sm#googledev) Google Employee |  \r\n",

The Full Statement is available below in the FAQ. \n\n**[Issue Tracker Statement](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/65425413#comment24) TL;DR:** Constantly evaluate unlock mechanisms, extremely low usage, alternatives available that are easy to use, secure and have much wider adoption.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Background**\n\n(ICYMI) In Case You Missed It, earlier this week I [posted a thread here ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/72tj6u/psa_google_have_quietly_removed_nfc_smart_unlock/) on /r/Android detailing that Google have removed the NFC Smart Unlock option from new Android account sign-ins and devices. This change affects all Android Versions (5.0-8.0). If this is news to you then I would also recommend reading that [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/72tj6u/psa_google_have_quietly_removed_nfc_smart_unlock/) as it covers a lot of important details regarding the removal. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Here is a very basic recap**\n\n- Starting a few months ago some Android users were reporting on various [sites](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/6p0bup/anyone_has_nfc_smart_lock_working/) and [forums](https://forums.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-note-8/834005-no-nfc-smart-lock-anymore.html) that NFC Unlock was missing from their devices.\n\n- NFC Unlock was still listed as a feature on the [Pixel](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/6093922?hl=en) and [Nexus](https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/6093922?hl=en) Support Pages. As of the 29^th of September those pages have [since been updated](https://imgur.com/a/jtwHa) and the NFC Unlock section has been removed.\n\n- Users were not given any advanced notice or warning about the feature removal.\n- Accounts or Devices signed-in/setup in the month of June or earlier were not affected. \n- Users that sign-in/setup their Devices from July/August 2017 and onward DO NOT have access to this feature anymore.\n- Performing a major device software upgrade or Factory reset will disable the feature. Even if it was in use previously. Security Updates do not appear to disable the feature.\n- Currently there is no know way to restore this feature, it has been classified as \"Deprecated\" by Google.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n**FAQ**\n&nbsp;\n\n**What is NFC Smart Unlock?**\n\nNFC Smart Unlock allows a user to unlock their Near Field Communication Enabled Android phone using a physical token or card. Many companies sell NFC Rings or Wristbands specifically to be used for Device unlocking and authentication. NFC Smart Unlock allows an NFC Tag or accessory to act like a Physical key to access a device. This type of authentication technology is also very common in the enterprise as well as with Hotels and Apartment Building complexes.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**What Devices or Android Versions are affected?**\n\nAll Versions of Android with Smart Unlock are affected (5.0, 5.1, 6.0, 7.0, 7.1, and 8.0). The NFC Smart Unlock feature is remotely enabled/disabled by Google. Internet Access is necessary to activate All Smart Unlock Features (Voice, Face, Bluetooth etc). Contrary to popular belief the Version of Google Play Services Installed Does Not affect the availability of the feature. There has been a recent increase in the number of people reporting this issue due to users installing updates and upgrading to Android 8.0 Oreo. As more users upgrade their devices in the months to come more people are likely to lose this access to this feature.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**My Device still has NFC Smart Unlock are you sure it's just not a Bug?**\n\nThis issue currently affects All NEW Android Device Logins. If you setup your device or signed into your Google Account in June 2017 or earlier then you should not be affected. If you perform a device factory reset or flash a new ROM Image then NFC Smart Unlock will not be available to you anymore. Currently there is no know 'fix' as this feature has been *\"deprecated\"* by Google.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Why has this happened? - [Updated with Statement]**\n\nIn an official statement on the 30th of September (3 days after my initial [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/72tj6u/psa_google_have_quietly_removed_nfc_smart_unlock/)) Google have broken their silence on the matter. Their statement was posted on their [issue tracker](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/65425413#comment24) and reads as follows.\n\n> \"Thanks everyone for your comments.\n> \n> Smart Lock provides seamless and secure methods of unlocking your Android phone. For example, you can keep your device unlocked when it\u2019s connected to your Bluetooth device such as your smartwatch or car, or when it\u2019s in a trusted place, such as your home. Since Smart Lock was launched in Android 5.0, we have added more methods of unlocking, such as On-Body detection and made several security improvements to the different unlock methods. Today, many Android phones also support Fingerprint authentication which provides another convenient way to unlock your phone.\n> \n> We constantly evaluate unlock mechanisms and evolve them. Our end goal is to provide the best possible experience for you that balances security, simplicity and convenience. We constantly make product decisions based on multiple factors including usage, the value we provide, your feedback, and the availability of alternatives.\n> \n> In the case of NFC unlock, we\u2019ve seen extremely low usage. At the same time, there are alternatives available now that are easy to use, are secure and have much wider adoption. Given this, we decided to disable NFC unlock. However, if you have NFC unlock currently set up, you can continue to use it until you reset your device, switch to a different device, or explicitly remove the NFC tag from Smart Lock settings.\n> \n> We apologize to those of you who are affected by this and we\u2019re sorry for any inconvenience. We encourage you to use a different unlock method in Smart Lock, such as Trusted Bluetooth devices, Trusted Places, or On-body detection, all of which we believe to provide a better user experience.\"\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Are there any alternative options or workarounds?**\n\nAs far as I know there are some options using third party apps but there isn't currently any known work around to re-enable the Google NFC Unlock Feature. Regardless users shouldn't have to use a third party app to gain back functionality they already had access to. Not to mention the potentially major security and privacy issues that come with using a third party app.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Why Does this Matter?**\n\nGoogle has removed an important device feature silently without notice or warning to customers. This speaks volumes about how Google treats its customers. This also serves as a general warning to be mindful of this sort behaviour from Google. As Android Users we have a right to the features we paid for on the hardware we paid for. And if those software features need to be removed for some reason legal or otherwise then we deserve a warning beforehand and a reason saying exactly what is happening, why it is happening and what alternative options or potential resolutions there may be.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Background Information/Testing/Proof** \n\nIf you want my detailed testing and breakdown information then check post #4 on the [Issue Tracker thread](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/65425413) and also check the [Original PSA Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/72tj6u/psa_google_have_quietly_removed_nfc_smart_unlock/).\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Opinion - Long - TL;DR Below**\n\nBased on the statement this does look like a permanent change. I still do think NFC unlocking has its place on Android. There are many reasons I personally don't like the alternative Smart Unlock options they provide. From my perspective the argument that NFC Unlock should be removed due to security concerns doesn't hold much weight to me personally. As far as I'm concerned all the Smart Unlock options weaken the security of a device albeit in different ways. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nAs easy as it might be to clone an NFC Tag or token at range that doesn't mean the technology doesn't have a place and a legitimate use for authentication. RFID technology is widely used in many industries and applications, and whether it\u2019s right or not, it's generally seen to be *secure enough* in the **right** circumstances. I 100%  understand the perspective of people that are concerned about device security, particularly when it comes to smartphones. But to those same people I would also tell them that they shouldn't be using any Smart Unlock if that is a concern for them. It's a concern for me too.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAll of the Smart Unlock options available (NFC Included) have weaknesses. Some have weaknesses more significant than others. Google even warns users of this fact. \n\nThe [guide for Face unlock](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/6093922?hl=en#facial_recognition_choose) has a disclaimer that says\n> \"This facial recognition is less secure than a PIN, pattern, or password. Someone who looks similar to you could unlock your phone.\"\n\nThe [Trusted Places disclaimer](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/6093922?hl=en#trusted_places_choose) says\n>\"Your trusted location can go out beyond the walls of your home or custom place. It can keep your device unlocked within a radius of up to 80 meters. Location signals can be copied or manipulated. Someone with access to specialized equipment could unlock your device.\".\n \nThe [Bluetooth unlock section has a disclaimer](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/6093922?hl=en#add_bluetooth) that says\n>\"Bluetooth connectivity can be up to 100 meters. If someone takes your phone while it's near your trusted device, and if your trusted device has unlocked it, that person could access your phone.\"\n\n[On-Body Detection has a disclaimer](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/6093922?hl=en#on_body_choose) that says\n> \"As a security feature, on-body detection is less secure than a PIN, pattern, or password. Someone who takes your phone while it's unlocked with on-body detection could access your phone.\"\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf you use Smart Unlock **at all** you are, without a doubt, in *some way* weakening the potential security of your device. In an ideal world we would all use unique long complex passwords or passphrases as the only means to secure our devices. But we don't live in an ideal world. Smart Unlock is a way of creating convenient and accessible *'security options'* for people that allow them to keep their devices *'secure'*, at least *enough* of the time. They are certainly **not** perfect or perhaps even good enough. I would recommend that people avoid using them entirely if they can. I'd personally like to see Smart Unlock expanded to support multiple factors of authentication. For example, Smart Lock requiring a Fingerprint and a Bluetooth trusted device to unlock your phone.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBut until something like that happens and gets rolled-out natively we have to use what we're given. In my opinion NFC Smart Unlock is (was) the least terrible Smart Unlock option, as long as you use in the *right* circumstances. It also serves a function that none of the other Smart Unlock options can entirely replace. Even if you think that NFC and RFID technology is useless, flawed, dangerous or has no-value to you then fine, you don't have to use it. But you cannot deny the value it brings to other users, you can't make that judgement for them. Make sure people are aware of the issues and limitations of the technology and move on. \n\nIt is important that we strive to use the best technologies to secure the devices we use. It's also important that new technologies are tested and reviewed etc. But let people use the amount of security technology they want. As long as they fully understand the potential risks involved then there shouldn't really be an issue. That seems to be Google's approach with Smart Unlock, at least with everything else but NFC Unlock that is.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFor a couple days now I've seen many disappointed and annoyed Android users post comments on the issue tracker. I've read them all, they have a right to be annoyed about this, even if they shouldn't have been using in the first place or whatever else, they were. It was option given to them and now it has been taken away in an instant without any advanced warning or notice. I say this to anyone reading, if device security is a very important concern to you (I can understand why) please do not use any form of Smart Unlock, use a long complex unique password with no biometrics.  If you want something better than that, then don't use a phone with Google or any big third party integrated into it. If you want to go this sort of route then Copperhead OS on a Pixel comes to mind.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI personally started using NFC Unlock because I thought it was a cool, useful feature for home. Before I started using it I was already fully aware of the security issues that plague NFC and RFID technologies. I used NFC Unlock in a way that wasn't particularly subject to any malicious attacks. I knew what the risks entailed, found they didn't really affect me enough and decided to use it in specific situations. I don't have the option anymore anyway so it's a moot point really. Regardless I would like to see NFC Unlock return officially in some way but it doesn't seem all that likely. At least we actually got an official reason for the removal and this wasn't just entirely swept under the rug. Even so, an effectively last minute explanation after much confusion doesn't excuse Google for this. They removed a feature that is very important to many of their customers silently, without any warning and with seemingly little to no consideration as to the impact it might have. Third party apps will need to fill the void that Google has created here.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI know this was a bit long winded but I thought it important to get my opinion and a rebuttal out there to both Google's statement and other user comments. I don't expect everyone to agree with me and that's fine. Thanks for reading anyway.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Opinion TL;DR**\n&nbsp;\n\nNFC though not perfect has its place for Authentication. I would like to see it come back in some form to Android. NFC was the least terrible Smart Unlock Option, all of the Smart Unlock Options weaken device security. Don't use any Smart Lock if you care about device security, and if you do use it make sure you know the risks.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n",

            "selftext": "Autocorrect.  Yeah, and I bet you thought I didn't notice that error in my title...\n\nThe Android one sucks, the iOS one is considerably better. Am I the only one who notices this? Am I crazy? Am I out of my mind?\n\nHear me out...\n\nAutocorrect should accompany the user in typing, it's there as a polite, and sometimes more forceful nudge into the right direction. It's going to get shit wrong, I get that, and that's cool. I can't even specifically pinpoint where the root of the issue is.\n\nAll I know is typing with Google Keyboard is like trying to drive a car with a psychotic control freak pulling the wheel into the kerb.\n\nAlmost all the auto corrections it does are wrong, it will replace legitimate words with poor alternatives, it will happen to save incorrect suggestions and forget legitimate ones.\n\nThen when I want autocorrect to step in it doesn't! It will blissfully tease as I willingly carry on a sentence, a glaring mistake for which I can see the keyboard has recognised just waiting there for me to go back.\n\nAnd don't get me started with the backspace detection, where I get caught in some hopeless cycle of trying to type anything close to the right side of the keyboard whilst the backspace key gets a boner and rushes in to help erase all the work I do.\n\niOS's keyboard just worked. Contrary to how backwards the rest of the iOS experience is. It just worked in my favour, it just knew when to correct and when not to, like it was actually designed for a human being instead of some masochist control fuck monkey who likes having his will toyed with.\n\nAm I the only one this effects? Has everyone else installed some magical app that fixes this? Is everyone just going to take the highroad and continue the Android circlejerk?\n\nWho knows, I don't care I just wanted to rant, and may I add how difficult this was to do on my phone.",

            "selftext": "I've been on the iPhone since the very first model and what a joy that was at the time. I gradually became dissatisfied with the increasing work arounds I'd have to do to accomplish the most basic tasks, such as as downloading a file in Safari. Then there was the new flat look in IOS and the increasingly, what I thought, ugly choices being implemented. Finally, the iPhone 8 X. It's roughly 1200 Euros here in Europe and there's really nothing to be excited about. I was going to reluctantly upgrade once more when I thought I'd look again at Android. \n\nNow Android, in my mind, was the cheap low-end version of the iPhone riddled with ads and abysmal applications. Still, if I was to move elsewhere, and Windows Mobile was dead, what choice was there?\n\nLooking around at the hardware I soon discovered that even though the Samsung Galaxy S8 and Note 8 were both critically acclaimed as the best in Android, I wanted nothing to do with Samsung's approach to replacing as much as Android as they could with their own apps. I wanted stock Android. The Pixel was the obvious choice, but the update was just around the corner and I needed something now. I finally settled on the OnePlus 5. Sort of an iPhone 6/6S/7 clone, but near stock. I'm really pleased with the choice.\n\nNow on to the most important aspect of the whole thing, and that is finding the equivalent of some of my most used apps.\n\niMessages. Using plain messages for now works fine. Looking at using Allo. I can text. So everything even.\n\nFacetime. Google Duo. The video quality is about 90% of Facetime's. But a lot better than Skype. Slight win Apple.\n\nFind My Friends. I thought this would be hard but it was a piece of cake. I just had the rest of my iPhone carrying family download Google Maps and log in to Location Sharing. Everything even.\n\nMusic player. BlackPlayer Ex. One hell of a lot nicer app than the current Apple player. A major plus was the ability to edit my MP3 tags on the actual phone. Big win Android.\n\nVideos. MX Player Pro. Looks good, plays everything under the sun. Everything even.\n\nWeather. Today Weather. A really nice minimalistic app. Everything even.\n\niBooks. I loved that app and I spent a week going through the Google Play Store finding nothing but really terrible copies. Finally came upon Moon + Reader. It's all iBooks was and more. And I can edit my tags, download new covers, etc. Very happy guy here. Win Android.\n\nAs for the rest. Netflix and all the basics are the same. So no problems there.\n\nThe key thing remained the overall experience. I finally had control over my home screen. No locked in concrete lines of default icons. I can change the icons, move them where I want, add widgets. I also had the feeling I had an actual PC in my pocket. Everything I could do on a Windows or Mac system I could do here on Android. No baked in limitations. Downloads files, use a file manager to move them around. Even plug in a flash drive to copy things over. Fantastic. No more having to lug a computer on vacations because I just had to download something while away. \n\nBottom line... I'm really, really pleased with the move. The hardware is comparable to the iPhone 7 Plus I left behind. The apps I've installed are all, at least, the equal of what I had on IOS. And in many cases, way better. No more need for iTunes. After a great many years now, I've found a new phone to be a real undulated joy once more. In my opinion, and this is as the owner of pretty much everything Apple, Android is now actually way ahead and my only regret is that I didn't move over sooner. Oh, and I paid 500 Euros.",

            "selftext": "Recently the FCC has requested (not demanded) that Apple enable the FM radio functionality on iPhones - in the context of recent disasters and the necessity for secondary communication channels like FM radio.\n\n**Apple**\n\n- [FCC asks Apple to activate the iPhone\u2019s hidden FM radio to aid public safety](https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/28/16379316/fcc-iphone-fm-radio-activation-request-ajit-pai)\n\n>Most smartphones have an FM radio inside, and they have for a long time. Until recently, however, most of those radios were deactivated, so that owners couldn\u2019t use them. There were a handful of reasons for this, but two of the more obvious ones were that if your phone receives FM radio, you\u2019re going to be less likely to pay for music and extra wireless data \u2014 instead, you\u2019d just tune into the radio for free.\n>\n>As Pai points out, most wireless carriers and phone manufacturers have backed down on that in recent years and offered access to FM. \u201cApple is the one major phone manufacturer that has resisted doing so,\u201d Pai says.\n>\n>In the past, Pai has made it clear that he doesn\u2019t want the FCC to mandate that phone manufacturers enable FM radios, in part because it goes against free market policies. And in this case, he\u2019s not \u2014 **he\u2019s just asking**. But despite having no plans to mandate their activation, Pai has also said that \u201cyou could make a case for activating [FM] chips on public safety grounds alone.\u201d\n\nEDIT:\n\nAs pointed out by https://www.reddit.com/user/megared17, most modern iPhones don't have an FM tuner.  Older iPhones may have had an FM tuner (as part of some other chipset), but it was not physically connect to be useful.\n\nIn contrast the situation on Android is that the FM tuner is included depending on the variety of chipset being used.  Some manufacturers do however have it usable - i.e. if you have an FM radio app installed, you can use the FM tuner.  However on other android devices, it may not be usable by just using the app, if it is physically not connected in a way to be usable.\n\nEDIT2:\n\nApple has responded to FCC's Ajit Pai that it doesn't have FM radio hardware built into newer iPhone devices (and in earlier iPhones also the physical connections were not setup for working FM radio function):\n\n- [Apple would like to remind the FCC that it can\u2019t activate imaginary FM radios that iPhones don\u2019t have](https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/28/whose-fcc-is-this/)\n\n>That\u2019s right, Pai called on Apple to activate radios that don\u2019t even exist.\n>\n>Again, the radios do not exist in iPhones and haven\u2019t for over a year now.\n>\n>The FM block is simply not there in current iPhone radio chips. It may look the same but it\u2019s not on the chip at all. Broadcom would need to re-spin the chip to add the stuff Apple would need back in. They\u2019d also need, of course, to connect it up (which it never was even in the older phones) and build in an antenna and change its WiFi chip and add back in a headphone jack to use the headphones as an antenna.\n>\n>Which brings us to a final point: Apple has actually not had workable FM radios in iPhones in a very, very long time. Much further back than the iPhone 7. Even when the FM modules were included in the chip, they were not connected, had no antennas and no support was built in to other radio components. Basically, Apple can\u2019t switch on the FM radio in the iPhone 7, iPhone 8 and iPhone X because they don\u2019t exist. And it can\u2019t switch on many older FM radio chips because the iPhone\u2019s hardware simply does not support it.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Android**\n\nSince a number of Android devices also disable the FM radio, that same argument can be applied to Android manufacturers.\n\nBackground article on Android FM radio availability:\n\n- [The Hidden FM Radio Inside Your Pocket, And Why You Can't Use It](http://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2015/04/16/400178385/the-hidden-fm-radio-inside-your-pocket-and-why-you-cant-use-it)\n\n>Most smartphone models come with a built-in FM feature. Samsung, Apple and LG are among those who have not switched on the chip, but HTC and Motorola chips haven't been blocked, Smulyan says. Sprint has turned on the FM chip for phones on its network.\n\n- [Your Phone Has an FM Chip. So Why Can't You Listen to the Radio?](https://www.wired.com/2016/07/phones-fm-chips-radio-smartphone/)\n\n>Every smartphone in the world has an FM tuner built in. But here in the US, just one-third of them actually works, even though the Federal Emergency Management Agency says radio can save lives in an emergency. \n>\n>Apple remains the biggest holdout. The company did not respond to multiple requests for comment, but critics say it has little incentive to do anything that might undermine Beats One, Apple Music, and other streaming services.\n\n----\n\n**You can turn on the FM radio on those Android devices which allow it's use:**\n\n- [Unlock the secret FM tuner in your Android phone](https://www.cnet.com/how-to/unlock-the-secret-fm-tuner-in-your-android-phone/)\n\n>As for why phones have FM tuners at all, my guess is that Google's Android hardware specs include the feature, even if the OS itself doesn't offer any way to access it. And phone manufacturers probably don't see it as a big value-add, so they don't bother to develop or include a compatible app. Thus, the FM receiver remains deactivated.",

You should be safe to install security updates as long as they are on the same version of Android with the same account login session.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Update - 29 Sep:** Looks like Google have finally removed NFC Smart Unlock from the Online [Nexus](https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/6093922?hl=en) and [Pixel](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/6093922?hl=en) support pages. I expected this to happen at some point. Before I posted this thread I made sure there was a WayBack Machine Archive Copy. [Archive Version - 11^th - 28^th Sep-2017](https://web.archive.org/web/20170911155436/https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/6093922?hl=en)\nI've also created an [Imgur Album](https://imgur.com/a/jtwHa) highlighting the changes on the page. There still does not appear to be a reason or explanation for the removal.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Update - 30 Sep:** After a few days of complaints, comments and theories Google have finally given an Official explanation as to why NFC Smart Lock has been disabled for new Android logins and devices. The explanation can be found on the [issue tracker thread](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/65425413#comment24) and in my [reddit comment below](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/72tj6u/psa_google_have_quietly_removed_nfc_smart_unlock/dnpi5ny/). \n&nbsp;\n\n**Quote TL;DR:** Constantly evaluate unlock mechanisms, extremely low usage, alternatives available that are easy to use, secure and have much wider adoption.\n\n\nA disussion about the statement can be found in [this reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/73ejrk/psa_update_google_breaks_their_silence_and_gives).\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Non-TL;DR:**\n\nA Google employee recently responded on a [bug report](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/65425413) in the [Google Issue Tracker](https://issuetracker.google.com) that quote, \n> \"SmartLock NFC feature has been deprecated for new users. If you are not existing NFC users, the option will be hidden.\" \n\nThis comes after weeks of User complaints and bug reports on both the issue tracker and on other various [sites](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/6p0bup/anyone_has_nfc_smart_lock_working/) and [forums](https://forums.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-note-8/834005-no-nfc-smart-lock-anymore.html).\n&nbsp;\n \n**Link to the Issue Report:** https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/65425413 . \n\nNote that to view the Google Issue tracker site you will need to be signed in to a Google Account. The page cannot be viewed publicly on the internet. Because of that here is an [imgur screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/02N0v) of the page (27-Sep-2017).\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Okay, So what now?**\n\n~~Perhaps if enough people voice their concerns about this issue then we might be able get them to restore this feature or at the very least be given a detailed reason as to why it has been removed for new account sign-ins.~~\n\nIf NFC smart unlock functionality is important to you I would implore you to voice your concerns to Google as well as to your Device OEM. Feel free to \"Star\" ~~and Comment on~~ the relevant issue tracker [threads](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/65425413) etc. \n\nI know that many people rely heavily on NFC Smart Unlock and use it on a daily basis. Those users are entitled to the features that they have paid for.\n\nAs the issue tracker site is not publicly viewable hopefully this thread serves as a legitimate resource for people to refer to, hence the long post here.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**FAQ**\n&nbsp;\n\n**What is NFC Smart Unlock?**\n\nNFC Smart Unlock allows a user to unlock their Near Field Communication Enabled Android phone using a physical token or card. Many companies sell NFC Rings or Wristbands specifically to be used for Device unlocking and authentication. NFC Smart Unlock allows an NFC Tag or accessory to act like a Physical key to access a device. This type of authentication technology is also very common in the enterprise as well as with Hotels and Apartment Building complexes.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**What Devices or Android Versions are affected?**\n\nAll Versions of Android with Smart Unlock are affected (5.0, 5.1, 6.0, 7.0, 7.1, and 8.0). The NFC Smart Unlock feature is remotely enabled/disabled by Google. Internet Access is necessary to activate All Smart Unlock Features (Voice, Face, Bluetooth etc). Contrary to popular belief the Version of Google Play Services Installed Does Not affect the availability of the feature. There has been a recent increase in the number of people reporting this issue due to users installing updates and upgrading to Android 8.0 Oreo. As more users upgrade their devices in the months to come more people are likely to lose this access to this feature.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**My Device still has NFC Smart Unlock are you sure it's just not a Bug?**\n\nThis issue currently affects All NEW Android Device Logins. If you setup your device or signed into your Google Account in June 2017 or earlier then you should not be affected. If you perform a device factory reset or flash a new ROM Image then NFC Smart Unlock will not be available to you anymore. Currently there is no know 'fix' as this feature has been *\"deprecated\"* by Google.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Why has this happened?**\n\n30-Sep-17 - Google have provided an official statement regarding the removal, that statement and more information can be found in [this reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/73ejrk/psa_update_google_breaks_their_silence_and_gives). \n\nCurrently (27-Sep-17) Google have not officially provided a reason for the removal of the NFC Smart Unlock Feature. The feature was disabled very quietly and without a warning or notice to users. NFC Smart Unlock is still listed as a feature on Google's [Pixel](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/6093922?hl=en) and [Nexus](https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/6093922?hl=en) Online Help Documentation as of Sep 27. It is also listed in the Device Manual for New Android 8.0 Devices such as the [Xperia XZ1](https://support.sonymobile.com/global-en/xperiaxz1/userguide/unlocking-your-device-automatically/). My best guess would be it is some sort of Legal or Patent issue but as this feature has been available for a few years it does seem strange.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Are there any alternative options or workarounds?**\n\nAs far as I know there are some options using third party apps but there isn't currently any known work around to re-enable the Google NFC Unlock Feature. Regardless users shouldn't have to use a third party app to gain back functionality they already had access to. Not to mention the potentially major security and privacy issues that come with using a third party app.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Why Does this Matter?**\n\nGoogle has removed an important device feature silently without notice or warning to customers. This speaks volumes about how Google treats its customers. This also serves as a general warning to be mindful of this sort behaviour from Google. As Android Users we have a right to the features we paid for on the hardware we paid for. And if those software features need to be removed for some reason legal or otherwise then we deserve a warning beforehand and a reason saying exactly what is happening, why it is happening and what alternative options or potential resolutions there may be.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Background Information/Testing/Proof** \n\nIf you want my detailed testing and breakdown information then check post #4 on the [Issue Tracker thread](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/65425413).\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Opinion**\n\nIt would perhaps be more reasonable if this feature was removed for only new Google Accounts and all existing Android users got grandfathered in but this hasn't happened. I do find the wording on the issue tracker to be very questionable. \n> \"SmartLock NFC feature has been deprecated for new users. If you are not existing NFC users, the option will be hidden.\"\n \nI am not a \"new user\" I have been using Android since 2012 and have had a Google Account for nearly 10 years, I'm hardly a \"new user\". Even if you use the *new* device approach, I had the feature when I setup my device in June but now I do not, how am I not an \"existing NFC user\". I suspect Google plan for this to be at least a somewhat permanent change and if that ends up being the case it will really impact the companies and brands that make and sell NFC rings, wristbands and key-fobs etc. This move basically destroys a significant chunk of their business. Not to mention the investment from users in NFC Tags, Fobs and in some cases bio-implants. Fortunately for me I've only bought Stickers.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Other Relevant NFC Unlock Bug Report Thread**\n&nbsp;\n\nThere is also another NFC Smart Unlock Issue Tracker thread where users are complaining that the NFC Unlock Feature doesn't work very reliability on their devices. This thread has also been seen by a Google Employee and they state quote \"We've deferred this [issue?] to a future release, but leaving this open for now.\" \n\nLink: https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/62268615\n\n&nbsp;",

In the last 6 or so years, I have owned at least four or five Android devices and two iPhones. \n\nI prefer Android in almost every regard except for the lack of an iMessage equivalent for Android users. I know we have Google Hangouts and Allo but almost no one seems to use them. Put frankly- there is not a single messaging app that satisfies me the way iMessage does on an iPhone, and I have tried many. To me, the texting platform as a whole on the iPhone is better than Android in almost every way, except for the lack of customization. \n\nSpecifically, the ability to see when the other person is typing and has opened your message, as well as the peace of mind that your text has been delivered, are core features of texting on an iPhone that Android is missing. I realize that texting (SMS) and iMessage are technically different, but in the year I had an iPhone, the large majority of my friends used iMessage.\n\nTo many of you, texting may not be an important feature, but it's one of the things I use my phone most for, and I believe Google could stand to make a lot of improvements in the area.\n\nWhat do you all think?",

            "selftext": "Google's second generation Pixel phone is about a week away from launch. I'm expecting Google Lens to be released with a timed exclusive to the Pixel (hopefully the last gen Pixel as well) and a extreme low light photography being possible via some of the interesting research done by the Google camera team [here](https://research.googleblog.com/2017/04/experimental-nighttime-photography-with.html?m=1). \n\nAll that should be pretty great but one thing everyone else is doing is portrait mode. Google's been doing [this](https://research.googleblog.com/2014/04/lens-blur-in-new-google-camera-app.html?m=1) since back in 2014. While it's probably improved a considerable amount over the years it is now behind. Apple, Samsung, and others now use two camera sensors to do this same effect. The main benefit is that you click the shutter button and after some post processing you have your shot. Lens Blur requires you to move the camera up meaning it takes some planning and taking moving objects won't look as good. The problem is every Pixel 2 leak has only shown one camera on the back therefore the dual camera solution isn't possible. \n\nWhat is stopping Google from using a similar computational algorithm to how they calculate HDR (taking a series of under exposed photos and stitching them together) to stitch a couple of photos at different focus levels together to create a blurred background or foreground? I imagine this working where it takes let's say 5 photos one focusing as far away as the sensor can, one at as close as it can and one at the middle making the subject in perfect focus with maybe two shots with focus points in-between the perfect shot to get extra depth information for telling the depth of the objects in the photo. \n\nCameras these days can focus on objects extremely quick thanks to phase detection auto focus and laser auto focus. LG and other phones with proper Camera2 API suport have a slider that changes the focus level of the camera. [As (poorly) demonstrated here.](https://youtu.be/Nd7ogSGS2LQ#t=1m38s) So I think we are at the point where the hardware technology is readily available. The only challenge I could see is Google's HDR algorithm is using several in focus shots that are very much the same vs taking 3+ photos of varying focus might be hard to line up certain parts of the image but I think if you take enough shots that issue would be easier to determine. Does Lytro have some sort of computational hold on the techniques preventing this?\n\nWhat are your thoughts? Does this seem viable?\n\nEdit: I've been writing the post for a couple days and it turns out Google might be adding something after all according to [this](https://www.xda-developers.com/pixel-2-xl-stereo-speaker-music-recognition-portrait-mode/). I still think there's some value in keeping the post however. ",

            "selftext": "Because many ROMS lack all the basic desktop OS fonts, web site text looks noticeably different on mobile OSes. Today I realized that you can actually just add them (without replacing other fonts). There aren't any tutorials for this, surprisingly, so here is a quick short guideline on how to do it. Not a proper tutorial, but still useful for most tinkerers. The whole process is just editing a single system file, adding some font files, and setting permissions.\n\nIn my example, I'm adding Verdana (for reddit).\n\nPlace your TTF font files in */system/fonts/* and set their permissions to 0644.  \nThen add this right before the last line of */system/etc/system_fonts.xml* (back it up first!):\n\n    <family>\n    \t<nameset>\n    \t\t<name>verdana</name>\n    \t</nameset>\n    \t<fileset>\n    \t\t<file>Verdana.ttf</file>\n    \t\t<file>VerdanaBold.ttf</file>\n    \t\t<file>VerdanaItalic.ttf</file>\n    \t\t<file>VerdanaBoldItalic.ttf</file>\n    \t</fileset>\n    </family>\n\nRemember, you're placing that before the last line, `</familyset>`.\n\nFor the rest of the file, you'll have to remove all other instances of the font name `<name>verdana</name>` so that your additions aren't ignored. Easily done with find & replace. Make sure you don't accidentally remove the `name`that you added earlier.\n\nThe font filenames don't matter as long as they're listed in the same order (regular, bold, italic and bold-italic), but the `name` tag does. Make sure it's the same name that web sites use for the font. You can also add more than one name in the nameset. To see your changes, restart the apps that use the fonts.\n\nOnly tested on KK, but it should work anywhere else that uses a *system_fonts.xml*. I might make a full tutorial later.\n\n**Also**, stating the obvious here: if you do it wrong, your device won't boot and you'll have restore the backup XML file using ADB (which is why you should keep the backup in the same folder).",

However, unlike the previous Google Search, at first, it seemingly overrode my home button, appearing whether I did a long, short, or double tap. This meant that I seemingly had no way of getting to my launcher. \n\nUpon further investigation though, it appears that I *can* still get to my launcher; I just need to make a *very short press*. It's actually somewhat tricky, my normal natural \"short tap\" is actually not short enough, so I need to very quickly press and pull my finger off, like I'm touching something hot.\n\nAnyway, I just wanted to report all this. Hopefully, this will be fixed in the future. I use my launcher much more than I use voice control, and launching apps via Google Assistant is not fun.\n\nEDIT: The actual tap length needed to trigger Assistant (instead of the launcher) is something like >200ms. The \"short\" tap for the Assistant, on my Honor 9, is currently much shorter than any other app I have tried. I'm pretty certain this is only specific to my phone though, or at least to only a few select devices.",

            "selftext": "With the recent news of Google's acquisition of HTC's pixel division, I started to think of ways how Google can really take it to the next level and compete directly with Apple. With the fragmented nature of Android (different OEMs controlling their devices and no real continuity), is there anything that Google could do to make Pixels THE android device over alternatives like Samsung LG, Essential etc? \n\nFor example, we know how Google loves to start a project, halfway develop it and then drop it for something else to further confuse its customers. One thing that would seriously compel me to stick with the Pixel line over other Android devices is the development of Allo. I don't know if I speak for anyone else here but the one iOS feature I'm truly jealous of is iMessage. It's a shame that Android doesn't have something like that. Imagine if Google decided to integrate SMS into the Allo app as a Pixel/Nexus exclusive feature. To me that is a game changer. \n\nSamsung pretty much has a lock on the \"Android name\" for the mainstream customers, but doing something like this would not only make the Pixel more attractive, but it could also force more OEMs to play nicer to the ecosystem (closer stock Android experience, faster update rollouts) to keep up with the Pixel line. The Assistant was suppose to be the \"game changer\" when it was originally announced but kind of lost steam once it was rolled out to all Android devices. Don't get me wrong, I think all Android devices, not matter the OEM, should have all features available. But If Google really wants to compete head to head with Apple and become THE Android phone, I think they need make Pixel exclusive features.\n\nWhat features do you see Google needing to implement to take it to the next level, competition wise.",

            "selftext": "So ever since LineageOS came out I've been full out loving the more private experience. Almost everything is replaced with open source apps. However I was never able to pass SafetyNet. I'd repeatedly receive 'No Internet?' and 'Invalid Response Errors', even with GApps, on all AOSP ROMs. I'm typing this out not 5 minutes after getting it working, so I can detail my setup for anyone else having trouble.\n\nI'm currently using Herolte (S7 Flat), but I will post the respective Hero2lte (S7 Edge) links as well, as both the Kernel and LineageOS have successful ports to both devices, and Magisk is Universal.\n\n* You can find Magisk [HERE](https://forum.xda-developers.com/apps/magisk/official-magisk-v7-universal-systemless-t3473445) \n\n* You can find MicroG on their website [HERE](https://microg.org). However, for the sake of easiness, I use Setialpha's NanoMod MicroG Module which automates the process. You can find that [HERE](https://forum.xda-developers.com/apps/magisk/module-nanomod-5-0-20170405-microg-t3584928) if you so wish to use it as well. Nanomod also has a flashable patcher available, which is a godsend imo. \n\n**If you don't care for MicroG, then you can skip the Micro Gsetup steps and just flash GApps if you don't already have it.**\n\n* lyapota's modified TWRP w/ f2fs script patches -\n [BOTH](https://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=70835341&postcount=2)\n\n* LineageOS [Herolte](https://download.lineageos.org/herolte)/[Hero2lte](https://download.lineageos.org/hero2lte)\n\n* FireOpal Kernel - [Herolte](https://forum.xda-developers.com/galaxy-s7/development/kernel-fire-opal-kernel-1-1-0-t3564009)/[Hero2lte](https://forum.xda-developers.com/s7-edge/development/kernel-fire-opal-kernel-1-1-0-t3563794)\n\n**AS ALWAYS, BACK UP YOUR DEVICE (DUH)**\n\nSo, to start, you'll want to flash the TWRP file in Odin. It goes in the AP box.\n\nAfter flashing and confirming TWRP runs fine. Flash the files in this order.\n\n* LineageOS\n\n* FireOpal Kernel\n\n(I would do a reboot here, just to complete the LineageOS setup, and confirm it boots fine.)\n\n* Magisk\n\n* MicroG Module\n\n* MicroG Patcher\n\nAnd reboot again. If all is well, you'll jump back into LineageOS fine. Set up MicroG in the settings, and make sure the Self-Check boxes are all ticked. Turn on the 3 options back on MicroGs main menu, and go to Advanced Settings on Droidguard/Safetynet and check the option to use Official Servers.\n\nNow restart, and launch Magisk. Head to Downloads option in the swipe menu, and download Universal SafetyNet Fix. Reboot again. \n\nRelaunch Magisk, turn on Magiskhide, and check Play Store, Droidguard Helper, and Framework Proxy. If all goes well, you should pass SafetyNet, and almost all of your data is filtered out away from Google!",

Is there something you find that many app developers fuck up?\n\nMy personal pet peeve is when there are no easy ways to copy stuff from an app, specially links. For example, I think Fenix does not have the ability to copy the link to a tweet to your clipboard. It's a bit infuriating. Similarly, I don't know why Google doesn't let us disable holding down space-bar to switch keyboards on GBoard directly, I never want to switch keyboards. Instead, I'd like to see the ability to make the highlight current word and make the highlight menu pop up. This way I can use the spacebar's swipe function to precisely post text without having to worry about mashing some tiny spot on the screen. \n\n",

And you know Samsung is not afraid to throw shit at wall and see what sticks.\n\nAnd many competitors failed against Samsung, like, Sony, HTC even LG (but thanks to there recent lineups of smartphones I think they might compete) , the only ones that are raising are few Chinese OEM juggernauts like Xioami, Huwei and many more. But they are still no match for Samsung when it comes to Premium market smartphones sales only Apple is competing it to Samsung.\n\nBoth Samsung and Apple rising with their own distinction in Hardware like Samsung having excellent designed smartphones with best Screen, where Apple differentiating with there excellent SoC like A11 and other Hardware features like 3D Touch And Taptic Feedback and excellent software support. Where Google only competed this year only on camera.\n\n\nIt\u2019s not like Google isn\u2019t trying they have been trying from start like Nexus Q and Google Glass. But they have failed miserably and also partnering with Other OEM for Making there Nexus smartphones but they where popular among developers and Android purist. Even there \u201cChormebook Pixel\u201d despite having excellent design failed to sell. \n\nThan came the Pixel entry where Google became serious and wanted to make there place in premium market and they marketed it huge with best deals like Unlimited photo storage. But Alas despite all this it was also lacking in Hardware department like, no unique design, no waterproof, no stereo speaker, no different features like iPhone having 3D Touch or Dual Protrait Camera or Taptic Feedback Engine. The only good point of Pixel was Camera. But that was not enough because on others camera where already good it was that Pixel was better. And also supply issues where more prominent and yet it cost 699$ as other premium phones like Galaxy S8 Which was better in every way except for Camera and Software (pure Android). Thus it didn\u2019t sell well compared to others.\n\nAnd than came important one Apple AR kit, it blew everyone\u2019s mind despite google being ahead of with there project tango, Apple made it available to every iPhone 6S user above with an Simple update. And as google tells us that it will support more devices with its AR Core but still it\u2019s only for Pixel and Galaxy S8 where as Apple has already released it and there dozens of useful Applications for it.\n\nI think this is what made Google realised that They need to up there Hardware because Samsung is killing with there design and screen where as Apple has also upped there game Like there A11 Bionic chip and iPhone X design and Face ID.\n\nDespite all this I am still seeing on this Sub forum that Google is to compete with SoC with HTC, But it will take time for Google because building and excellent SoC is no small feat because Apple is doing it for more than 5 years with There Apple A4 chip the best example I can give you is, like how Apple failed incredibly when they introduced there Own Map Apps compared to Google own Map Apps.\n\n",

I do not need unnecessary features from TouchWiz or LG's dreaded UI. So when the LG G6 and S8 were released, I was pretty \"Meh\" about it. It was cool to finally have all screen displays but I was mostly focused on the Pixel and Pixel 2. Again for stock and quick updates. \n\nBut a friend of mine with an S8 let me use their phone for a bit. And despite always seeing TouchWiz in a negative light. It wasn't all that bad! There were useful features -- like creating gifs from a selected area -- I enjoyed. The screen is a lot more beautiful in person. They said battery life was excellent. The construction was air tight..\n\nIt reminded me of when I had my Nexus 5X. It had a poor screen and the battery life was terrible. But I liked the phone for it's core principles. And it had some features I loved like multiwindow.  the S8 opened my eyes that stock isn't necessarily all that. Unfortunately the S8 still has some lag here and there. But I enjoyed everything the phone offered.  And it feels great knowing I have options where previously I felt like I had to get a Nexus/Pixel. But it's still a flag ship tier phone. And with flagship phones becoming more expensive....\n\nI need to ask a few things ... How important are updates to you ? How long have you kept your phone ? And would it be smart (or even possible)  to drop $600+ on a phone and plan to keep it for 4 years? \n\nI never had a phone longer than a year and the closests to flagship phones ive had were the LG Flex 2 and Nexus 5X.",

A stock option that's well implemented in the low levels would've been awesome.  \nI know there's Ambient Display now, but I'd much prefer a blue notification LED for Facebook, Orange for Gmail, Green for SMS etc. - which I could identify from afar instead of having to walk over to my phone and look at my screen to see what notification I got.",

Personally, I initially hated the idea of it; even before, I wanted my devices to be more square than 16:9. Now though, I'm starting to warm up to the idea of a 2:1 aspect. It doesn't look that bad, and it makes perfect mathematical sense. I can't stand what Samsung has done, however. I just see no reason for that, and the 2:1 already distorts content enough as it is, so making it any longer is a terrible idea.",

I\u2019ve seen several people make Android-based MAME cabinets but what I\u2019m looking for is to make a controller for a native Android game. It would consist of two buttons and two joysticks. However, I have two concerns:\n1) There can\u2019t really be input lag, as it\u2019s for a rhythm game so timing is key\n2) The controller would need to mimic swiping, holding down on the screen, and tapping. So for example, tilting the joystick right would need to be read by the device as swiping right. Only needs to read swipes in 8 directions so it doesn\u2019t need to swipe the exact angle. I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any sort of interface available on Android for turning button presses into gestures\n\nAnyway, I\u2019d just like to know if anyone has done anything similar that has any insight into if this would be a feasible project. I have very little Android experience so I don\u2019t know a lot about its quirks or limitations. My biggest concern is that it\u2019d be technically possible but lag too much to be useful in a practical sense. Any tips appreciated!",

Why!?!\n\nOne other thing: If it is true that the Pixel 2 will not have a headphone jack, I'm hoping Google, and other companies that are deciding to do away wit the headphone jack, finds some way to still allow us to use the FM tuner without the headphone jack by being creative with their antenna design. Google has a glass window on their phone that could possibly help facilitate this, and most flagships have gone for the glass sandwich approach to design. ",

Then they updated their app last month and I was blown away. Even though I'm spending most of my time just staring at the live wallpaper, it doesn't show up on my App Usage battery stats, confirming its just as efficient as the devs say it was. My Note 8's screen on time in 6-8 hours consistently. Here are my brief thoughts about both apps;\n\n[**Earth & Moon Pro:**](https://youtu.be/5JjZigiggEw)\n\n- I love the random camera fly by. When I go the the homescreen, I'm greeted with a very majestic Earth coming into the picture with a zoom and fly in. Lovely. The clouds look great, and the sun effect is lovely. I love the realtime lighting depending on the time of the day.\n\n[**Live Earth:**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaPTeuN2FMQ)\n\n- This is way more subtle than Earth & Moon. The images are way more zoomed in, and they move way slower resembling a real rotation. The best thing about Live Earth's \"Your World\" is that the satellite imagery has real clouds overlaying the planet, and it refreshes. You can see how your location looks from space, which is really cool. However, it's less exciting as there are no camera fly ins, and the Earth occupies the whole screen, unlike Earth and Moon which has a decent rim of space at all times and just looks classier.\n\nWhat do you guys think? What is your go to space LWP?",

My question, which isn't new, is does it really matter anymore if my phone can open an app 1-2 seconds quicker or load a web page slightly quicker?  I listen to All About Android and Material podcast and have heard repeatedly that most mid-range phones are just as capable of doing what most people need from a phone. The trade-offs will most likely be software updates and camera quality. Even comparing camera quality, most phones made in the past two years will take really great photos. Even the Note 5 that came out two years ago takes awesome pictures.\n\nThe comparison also becomes more blurred when you compare iPhones. The 6s isn't very different than the 8. Ok, sure you have an upgraded camera and chip. But there is a huge price difference. And the software will be updated for a long time on both. If I were an Apple user, I'd be looking at the 6s or even the 7. The 7 is so close to the 8, it's not even funny. \n\nObviously, we the consumers, buy what they're selling us so who's really to blame the most?  I consistently see, especially iPhone users, using a one or two year old phone. I used to think to myself, why haven't they upgraded, if they are able?  I've begun to see why. Because they don't need to. Phones seem to be one of the only things that people upgrade every year or every two years. Cars, laptops, appliances, you name it. The vast majority of people don't upgrade those things as frequently as smartphones. There are so many different variables that come into play with this, there's no way I could list them all. \n\nAnyway, what are your thoughts?  Let's keep it civil, please. ",

Meaning it would be preferable to charge your phone slowly when you're not in a rush, and reserve fast charging for when you really need that quick boost before going out.\n\nBut how does that tie in with wireless and overnight charging?\n\nI'm sure most of us do charge our phones overnight because we just rush to go where we need to go in the morning. Even if I can fast charge after I wake up, I usually need to use my phone while I'm having breakfast, etc. which means I prefer to charge overnight and start the day at 100%.\n\nBased on the heat rationale, I guess it would be better to charge the phone slowly overnight since you will be doing that every single day... but is that also true for wireless charging?\n\nAs far as I know, wireless charging is slower because it's less efficient, which basically means it dissipates more energy in the form of heat. But is that heat better of worse for your battery than the one dissipated when you charge your phone using fast wired charging? Will the battery suffer more using a slow wireless charger vs a slow wired charger?\n\nI would love to hear everyone's thoughts on this since I feel like there's not much information around regarding this topic, and I'm sure we all want our batteries to retain as much capacity as possible through the years (especially since most phones don't have removable batteries anymore!).",

One of the key strengths was its HDR. Google Pixel was known for having the best HDR on any smartphone due to their HDR+ algorithm, but now it seems to have a serious competition. \n\nHere are some examples from DxOMARK. Pay attention to how the highlights and the shadows are exposed: \n\nScene 1:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/z67Ec0b.jpg\n\nScene 2:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/5eGSnxR.jpg\n\nAs you can see, the iPhone 8 exposes the details in the dark areas (shadows) better than the Pixel, without overexposing the bright areas (highlights) at the same time. The iPhone 8's HDR performance seems to match that of the Pixel, which no other smartphone was able to do. My guess is that the iPhone 8 could possibly be using an algorithm like Google's HDR+ where they stack bunch of underexposed photos. Or they could be using the traditional HDR method but with a new sensor and processor which allows them to stack lot more frames than before.\n\nHopefully this means we can see improvements in HDR throughout all other android devices as well. \n\nEdit: Note that I'm not saying DxOMARK's scoring system is fair, but based on the sample shots floating around, the iPhone 8 simply seems to have an HDR that is on par with the Pixel.

            "selftext": "**Summary**\n\nThe Qualcomm vs. Samsung relationship is \"complicated\" - while Qualcomm squeezes Samsung to not sell Exynos to other phone manufacturers, Samsung benefits from preferential access to inventory, and from manufacturing high-end Qualcomm chipsets.\n\n----\n\n**Why Exynos is not used by Samsung in the U.S. market ?**\n\nAs background, due to a patent-related agreement between Qualcomm (holder of many patents) and Samsung, Samsung cannot sell it's Exynos chipset to other phone manufacturers:\n\n- [Qualcomm Might Have Prevented Samsung From Selling Its Exynos Chipsets to Other Phone Manufacturers](http://wccftech.com/qualcomm-prevented-samsung-selling-exynos-soc/)\n\n>According to The Korea Economic Daily, Qualcomm abused the \u2018standard essential patent\u2019 license to prevent Samsung from selling its modems and integrated chipsets for around 25 years. According to the source, this is considered as an unfair practice and has been confirmed by the Fair Trade Commission.\n>\n>To recap, the Fair Trade Commission had decided to fine Qualcomm $865 million over antitrust violations, which stated that the company violated the law of competition, but the chipset manufacturer intends to appeal the decision.\n\n- [Qualcomm licensing blocked Samsung from selling Exynos chips](https://www.androidcentral.com/qualcomm-licensing-blocked-samsung-selling-exynos-chips)\n\n>The deal reportedly dates back to 1993, when an agreement was reached to allow Samsung to make its own modem chips using certain CDMA patents, but only for use in its own phones. Subsequently, either Samsung or the phone maker would've had to pay Qualcomm licensing fees if they wanted to use an Exynos SoC in a non-Samsung phone. Talks between the two to reach an alternative agreement reportedly broke down in 2013.\n>\n>Since then, non-Samsung Exynos phones have been few and far between, with the Meizu Pro 5, being a rare example.\n>\n>While Qualcomm's licensing terms may hold back Samsung's semiconductor business, the group has benefitted in other areas from Qualcomm's dominance. The past two generations of high-end Snapdragon processors have been manufactured by Samsung, and the upcoming Galaxy S8 is widely reported to have first dibs on the upcoming Snapdragon 835, giving Samsung a competitive advantage over rivals.\n>\n>Qualcomm faces similar legal action in from the U.S. FTC over allegedly abusive licensing practices, and in 2015 it paid a $975 million antitrust fine in China. Apple is currently suing the firm in the U.S. and China, claiming Qualcomm has abused its position in the market.\n\n\nBy the way, Apple recently won two lawsuit hearings on royalty and antitrust issues vs. Qualcomm:\n\n- [Qualcomm dealt double blow in its royalty fight with Apple](http://www.pcr-online.biz/news/read/qualcomm-dealt-double-blow-in-its-royalty-fight-with-apple/039707)\n\n>Qualcomm has lost two key rulings in its patent royalty fight with Apple. First the chipmaker failed to force Apple\u2019s manufacturing partners to make royalty payments prior to a determination of what the total disputed royalties should be, and second it lost an effort to stop Apple from pursing antitrust cases against it in other countries.\n\n\n\nSo the relation between Qualcomm and Samsung is complicated - in one way Samsung is cramped - it can't sell Exynos to other phone manufacturers, but on the other hand Samsung benefits because of a \"special relationship\" with Qualcomm - getting access or guaranteed supply, while also being manufacturer of high-end CPUs for Qualcomm.\n\nSo it could be called a \"synergistic\" relationship - or just simply complicated.\n\n\nHere is some more discussion on this:\n\n- [Why does Samsung continue to use Snapdragon chips in the US when their own Exynos chips perform better in benchmarks?](https://www.quora.com/Why-does-Samsung-continue-to-use-Snapdragon-chips-in-the-US-when-their-own-Exynos-chips-perform-better-in-benchmarks)\n\n\nThe answers seem to suggest that the Qualcomm chipset is still more advanced than the Exynos when it comes to the radio modem part - as relates to the standards relevant in the U.S.  And more particularly because CDMA (predecessor of LTE in the US) is not well supported by the Exynos chipset - which is still required for legacy U.S. markets.\n\nIn turn Samsung makes the chipsets for Qualcomm - so for Samsung it is a customer as well.\n\nAnother argument proposed is that Qualcomm underperforms Exynos in CPU scores, but outperforms in other stuff.\n\n- [Galaxy Note 7 benchmarks: Exynos vs. Snapdragon head-to-head](https://m.androidcentral.com/note-7-head-head-exynos-vs-snapdragon-benchmarks)\n\nRelated issues:\n\n- [Unraveling the 4K at 30fps vs. 60fps video recording conundrum on the Note 8](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/71pz33/unraveling_the_4k_at_30fps_vs_60fps_video/)",

Not because I wanted to keep it, but because Essential made it so very hard to get rid of it.\n\nBackground: Pre-order phone and placed order as soon as an actual \"purchase\" could be made.  Essential charged my account on 8/21 and did not ship till 8/28.  Phone delivered 8/31.\n\nOn 9/1, I initiated the return process as by calling their 888 numbers (no response) and also tried emailing them for a return that same day.  After not hearing back, I emailed them again on 9/6 to again try to start the procedure.   They replied this time, and after some clarification about what I wanted to do, told me to expect a return label in 3-5 business days.  According to their website, they would \"generate\" a label so I figured they would just email me one like every other company.  This was not the case... They clarified they would be sending me some kind of package.  The next 3-5 business days came and no label, no box.  I asked them if I could have a tracking number for this package, but they did not have that.  They told me now to wait till 9/15 and said \"If you still do not receive the return package by the end of business day on Friday, please let us know then, and we will start the process again.\"  \n\nAwesome to know the process is so good, they have to start it again if it doesn't show up.  Nothing came of course and I reached out again.  I was once again told \"You can expect to receive a package from our partners at Asurion within the next 5 \u2013 7 business days. \" \n\nBy this time of course, I already had a payment due with their financing folks (Affirm) since they charged me on 8/21.  Essential would not send me the label over email and would not provide me with a tracking number for this package once again.\n\nI finally opened a dispute with Affirm on 9/19.  Go figure, on 9/20 I suddenly received notification from my Fedex app that a package was on it's way to me.  Coincidence? Maybe?\n\nAlso funny, a Tweet on 9/18 to them was ignored but I got a response to DM them once I added the #essentialphone tag the next day.  Funny how that works.  They never replied to my DM till today 9/22.\n\nHere's hoping my refund now get processed without incident.\n\nI don't want to imagine what it's like to get any kind of service from these guys should something go wrong with the phone.  \n\nTLDR:  It's not easy to return an Essential phone.",

            "selftext": "**Summary:**\n\nNote 8 ships as Snapdragon/Exynos variants.  They support 4K at 30fps video recording, but that is a limitation of the Snapdragon 835 variant.  The Exynos 8895 variant can potentially support 4K at 120fps.\n\nWill Samsung release an update just for the Exynos variant, or will they refrain from breaking Snapdragon/Exynos symmetry.  If they don't they risk losing on one of the features vs. iPhone X (supports 4K at 60fps).\n\n----\n\n**Details:**\n\n\nThe Note 8 supports 720p at 240fps and 4K at 30fps (recording) and 60fps (playback).\n\nCompare this to the iPhone X supporting 1080p at 240fps and 4K at 60fps.\n\nHowever, there were reports that the Samsung website advertised 4K at 60fps for the Note 8.  So there was expectation of an update:\n\n- [Note 8 Camera Update to 4K 60fps?](https://forum.xda-developers.com/galaxy-note-8/how-to/note-8-camera-update-to-4k-60fps-t3672701)\n\n- [The Galaxy Note 8 also has 4K at 60 FPS video recording coming... soon](https://www.phonearena.com/news/Sorry-Apple-the-Galaxy-Note-8-has-4K-at-60-FPS-video-recording-coming_id98082)\n\nHowever, it was later confirmed by Samsung that the 60fps was a typo:\n\n- [Samsung's Galaxy Note8 is not getting support for 4K 60fps video capture](https://www.neowin.net/news/samsung039s-galaxy-note8-is-not-getting-support-for-4k-60fps-video-capture)\n\n>Earlier today, it was reported that Samsung updated its product listing for the Galaxy Note8 to say that the device will support 4K video capture at 60fps. As it turns out, that was just a typo, Samsung has confirmed to Neowin, and the product listing once again says 30fps.\n>\n>Even though the information came from an official product listing, it was a bit curious. Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 chipset only supports 4K capture at 30fps, and that's the SoC that the device uses in the United States. Interestingly, international variants use Samsung's in-house Exynos 8895 processor, which can support 4K capture at up to 120fps.\n>\n>What that means is that if Samsung wanted to implement the feature, it would only be able to do so on certain models of the Galaxy Note8.\n\n\nLike other Samsung S and Note series devices, the Note 8 ships in two variants:\n\n- Snapdragon 835 (SM-N9500) for the U.S. market\n- Exynos 8895 variant (SM-N950F) for international (as is the tradition with Samsung)\n\n\nWhile the Snapdragon 835 specs support 4K at 30fps recording and 60fps playback, the Exynos 8895 supports 4K at 120fps recording (i.e. clearly superior) - this opens up the possibility of Samsung providing an update that unlocks the faster fps for the Exynos variant of the Note 8.\n\n\n**Politics of Snapdragon/Exynos symmetry breaking**\n\nWhether Samsung will be able to do that - risking ire of Snapdragon users as they fall behind - which may prevent them introducing this asymmetry in features between Snapdragon/Exynos.  However, Samsung also has the iPhone X breathing down it's neck - which would prevent Samsung touting Note 8 as beating iPhone X in all matters comprehensively.\n\nIf nothing else, some rooted solutions from xda-developers etc. may wind up enabling 4K at 60fps on the Exynos 8895 variants of the Note 8 possibly.\n\n\n**References:**\n\nSnapdragon 835 specs:\n\n- [Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 Mobile Platform to Power Next-Generation Immersive Experiences](https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2017/01/03/qualcomm-snapdragon-835-mobile-platform-power-next-generation-immersive)\n\n>4K Ultra HD video capture @ 30 fps, up to 4K Ultra HD video playback @ 60 fps, support for H.264 (AVC) and H.265 (HEVC);\n\n\nExynos 8895 specs:\n\n- [What to expect: Exynos 8895 vs Snapdragon 835](http://www.androidauthority.com/exynos-8895-vs-snapdragon-835-751728/)\n\n>4K UHD @ 120fps\n\n- [Exynos 8895 processor supports 4K video at 120 fps and 28MP cameras](https://www.dpreview.com/news/6827459757/exynos-8895-processor-supports-4k-video-at-120-fps-and-28mp-cameras)\n\n- [Samsung Galaxy Note 8 Exynos, Snapdragon models compared](https://androidcommunity.com/samsung-galaxy-note-8-exynos-snapdragon-models-compared-20170818/)\n\n>We\u2019ve sighted two different models already: the SM-N9500 and SM-N950F. We\u2019ve been saying they are two variants based on SoC\u2019s listed. Both phones are equipped with a 1080 x 2220 resolution display, 8MP and 12MP cameras, 6GB RAM, 64GB onboard storage, and Android 7.1.1 Nougat. As we noted earlier, the SM-N9500 is powered by a Snapdragon 835 while the SM-N950F runs an Exynos 8895.\n\n\n**Explanation of why Samsung doesn't use Exynos chipset for the U.S. market**\n\n- [Why Exynos is not used by Samsung in the U.S. market ? - a recap](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/71rjyx/why_exynos_is_not_used_by_samsung_in_the_us/)\n\nRelated:\n\n- [Samsung S9 to feature 1080p at 1000fps (short clips) exceeding iPhone X (1080p at 240fps)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/71l6yd/samsung_s9_to_feature_1080p_at_1000fps_short/)\n\n",

            "selftext": "I've been an android user since the g1 days. One thing that frustrates me is the lack of consistency in standard functions. Specifically, the location of forward back and menu and menu buttons.\n\nI recently bought a new phone and I'm constantly hitting back instead of menu as my previous phone's button order was the other way around, right to left.\n\nI know it's just muscle memory, and not a huge issue. I'll get used to it of course, but it reminded me that I've experienced this in almost every case where I've changed device. It's not like changing buttons from left to right adds any functionality. It's just a nuisance and inconsistencies like these between handsets could easily be solved if Google was to implement certain standards and procedure for hardware manufacturers.",

Mass production of 1000 image sensor per second - in Korean](http://www.etnews.com/20170915000199?mc=em_001_00001)\n\n- [Samsung Galaxy S9 Video Camera Tipped To Be 4 Times Faster Than iPhone X](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paulmonckton/2017/09/21/samsung-galaxy-s9-1000-fps-video-camera-sensor/)\n\n>A 1000fps video capability in the Galaxy S9 would outpace the newly released iPhone 8 and iPhone X handsets, which are capable of 240 fps ...\n\nPresumably 1000fps for 1080p (compare this to the iPhone X's 1080p at 240fps).\n\n>... but the limited recording time would restrict this advantage to very short clips which some will view as more of a gimmick than a serious video recording feature.\n\nThis suggests the 1000fps may be possible because the images are buffered to camera-specific memory and so maybe applicable for short clips.  However, this is the case for pro high-speed cameras as well - though how much they can buffer depends on how much dedicated RAM has been put in to buffer the video (since direct to internal storage is not possible because of slowness of flash storage etc.).\n\nEDIT:\n\nThe iPhone X supporting 1080p at 240fps and 4K at 60fps.\n\nThe Note 8 supports 720 at 240fps and 4K at 30fps (recording) and 60fps (playback) - but actually the Snapdragon 835 variant has that 4K at 30fps limit - the Exynos 8895 variant of the Note 8 can go up to 4K at 120fps.  It remains to be seen if Samsung will increase to 4K at 60fps at least for the Exynos variant of the Note 8:\n\n- [Unraveling the 4K at 30fps vs. 60fps video recording conundrum on the Note 8](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/71pz33/unraveling_the_4k_at_30fps_vs_60fps_video/)\n",

It was recently on sale so I bought it figuring I would use it someday (and it seemed like a great app so why not support the developers anyway) but I didn't actually use it until yesterday.\n\n\n\nSo whenever I'm watching videos on my phone, I like to pump up the brightness. This is no problem with MX Player as it has independent brightness settings. However, when using YouTube, for example, I have to manually do it. So I set up Tasker to automatically increase the brightness when the YouTube app is running in landscape mode (so that it only increases the brightness when I'm actually watching something and not just browsing through the app).\n\n\n\nI'm using this profile now for YouTube, Plex and Netflix and it works as expected. It doesn't seem to work though with Amazon Prime Video.\n\n\n\nAnd now I'm thinking that I've been missing a lot. So, what are you actually using Tasker for?\n\nEdit: Wow, so many comments.

            "selftext": "Let's see how your phones have degrade. I'll start with mine.\n\nI have a Sony Xperia L, bought in April 2014.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**HARDWARE**\n\nThe plastic case of the phone is still intact. The matte paint has chipped off especially on the corners, the silver paint on the Xperia logo on the back is gone. The camera button just popped off just a while ago.\n\nOn the front, some of the faux metal lining's silver paint has chipped off. The LED strip still works. Since this is an OEM phone (Sony design, manufacturer chose the parts), it doesn't have the shitty anti-shatter proof screen protector of its generation and has instead an anti-scratch glass like a cheap Gorilla glass. There are no visible scratches, so that's nice.\n\nOn the inside, I'm still using the battery that came with it. The battery life degraded by about 30 minutes average. Charging started to be buggy a few months ago, sometimes it will charge at the usual 2.5 hours and sometimes more than 3 hours. \n\nEverything else inside (camera, storage, SoC) seems to be working just fine, albeit a noticeable slow down compared to before. The bugs with the touch screen display (multi-touch issues, problems during charging) are still there and looks like no software update can fix it, though is still usable.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**SOFTWARE**\n\nThe phone is stuck with 4.2.2. I haven't installed a custom ROM yet since it's still reliable and am afraid of it degrading my phone faster and I can't buy a new one for now. There are noticeable slow downs compared to before and might be because of the OS version, the Snapdragon 400's performance degradation, the now very limited 1 GB RAM, the small and partitioned 8 GB storage (which also has slowed down), and the constant updates on the apps especially with Chrome which I use the most. I have uninstalled a lot of apps because of the limited storage and the app updates making them eat more and more storage space, with Chrome and the Google app being the most sensitive with having enough storage for updates. I always need to delete Chrome's cache just to update my apps.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**TLDR**; The phone's hardware and software, mainly with the battery life and software performance, has degraded over time but is still usable and enough for me. I do use it conservatively and have been more conservative because of the degradation.",

            "selftext": "Tl;dr: As an European consumer trying to do the right thing (and still buy a phone), will the Fairphone 2 suffice for 2 years to come. Is there any gotchas to the ethical approach the company is pursuing?\n\nThe Fairphone 2's ethical message is intriguing. The material on its site seems to purvey transparency of the manufacturing process in detail. It still was critized by the wired magazine to come a little short on doing something about the issues in the external production pipeline. Reading forums it is evident that the specs for the device were not high-end to begin with, and that was back in 2015.\n\nHowever, this is the way to go in my opinion. Consumers should tone it down with their expectations in order to secure a more balanced and ethical pipeline for these devices. It matters, as we're hugely dependent on these in our everyday life and have grown accustomed to spend some money on them anyway. Some have argued that it's better to buy a second hand phone and spend money on a charity instead. Recycling is fine, but one is indirectly attributing to maintaining a price level for those models. For example some (did) buy apple products more hastily, because you could sell it for a good price if you changed your mind. However the bigger problem I see is that this kind of effort should be encouraged, and buying a 2nd hand phone and using charity channels won't help making companies care more for these matters (in most cases).\n\nAs far as the specs are concerned, I'm willing to do sacrifices if I could assure myself that a LG G3 level phone would last for moderate 'power using' for at least the next 2 years. The repairability lends some weight on this, as I'm still using my samsung s3 and I think the issue with it is not solely the outdated specs, but actually that it's weared down - to put it simply (no 4g when they're shutting down 3g capabilities from the towers doesn't help either).\n\nThere's been reddit threads of this nature before, but instead of necrobumping I thought to write a new thread. It seems to matter to some people. Also, the \"it's not on par with the iphone\" and \"do an individual contribution to charity\" arguments didn't convince me. I'm used to tweaking and fixing things, so I can live with some of that. Of course I would prefer to streamline my life, but is it worth supporting corporations that don't care if a guy gets an iron lung disease just because they live far enough? Also - this has been going since the middle ages is not a good argument, don't you think - or am I lost here?\n\nI'm very much interested in hearing your opinions about this. Links to references would be brilliant, though not expected - I'll edit in a few myself if this gets any responses.\n\nThanks for taking the time to read this and responding.\n- - - \nedit: Here's some links and additional thoughts.\n\n[The Wired article](http://www.wired.co.uk/article/fairphone-2-review-price-specs-features) that I refered to.\nTheir spikiest critique was that Fairphone uses the same manufacturers as the rest of the bunch and that even though they pursue to require minimum wages it's not the same as living wages. Also they mention that why did FP go with Hi-P as they're final manufacturer in the first place - but the FP site does have something like [an assessment report on Hi-P](https://www.fairphone.com/en/2015/02/19/the-path-to-finding-our-new-production-partner-hi-p/). Is it not worth anything or did the journalist not read it, I don't know yet.\n\nIn most articles the camera in the device was 8M pixels, but is now actually upgraded to 12M. Apparently this change is so recent, that no-one has actually gotten hold of one to test it, as there's no reviews that actually review the device.\n\nThe Fairphone site has lots of details on the Story page about how they've travelled to the mines in DRC, where the phone is manufactured, etc. This seemed quite interesting to me, as it shows the map of places and has a list of the components and [their provider's and their locations](https://www.fairphone.com/en/how-we-work/mapping-phone-made). Besides producing the \"ethical phone\", it seems to me that the FP is making a fair effort in reporting information about the backgrounds of phone manufacturing. Here's an example: [Issues correlated to resources](https://www.fairphone.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/FairphoneScopingStudyMatrix_Final.pdf)\n\nWhen checking out [the fixing instructions for the screen](https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Fairphone+2+Display+Assembly+Replacement/53562) I remembered how I dropped my previous phone on the floor cracking the screen - took one look at it and thought \"yeah that's done\" (also the charging jack had broken and fixing that seemed like quite a challenge).",

Here are some things I use it for:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n-\"Turn on flashlight\" - without ever unlocking the phone or wasting 1 of 2 lockscreen shortcuts\n\n-\"Turn off wifi/blu-tooth\"\n\n-\"Mute the phone\" - skips dragging down notification and a few taps\n\n-\"Turn on vibrate\" (need to create a quick command)\n\n-\"Turn on sound\" - (quick command)\n\n-\"Open camera settings\"\n\n-\"Video 4k\" - (quick command) - Opens to camera settings and changes to 4k video size\n\n-\"Video 1440p\" (quick command)\n\n-\"Video 60 frames\" (quick command)\n\n-\"Camera portrait\" (quick command) - 4:3 aspect ratio\n\n-\"Camera Landscape\" (quick command) - 16:9 aspect ratio\n\n-\"Take a selfie/photo in 2/5/10 seconds\"\n\n-\"Turn on iris scanning\" (quick command) - for those times when I want extra security\n\n-\"Turn on face recognition (quick command) - to set back to default\n\n-\"Set a reminder in x minutes to ___\" - voice recognition not as good as Google's but I can do this all without unlocking the phone.\n\n-\"Set ringtone/media/notification/system volume to 1-100\"\n\n-\"Navigate to X - opens up Google Maps\n\n-Plus any obscure setting you're not sure is located, Bixby can most likely find it under several menus deep.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAs Sakitech mentioned, Bixby and Google work together quite well - Bixby for managing device settings, and Google for live info it can scour in the net. I've never found much use for Google Assistant before and never bothered trying it, but Bixby got me interested in actually using them. Not every function needs to save time; if an AI simply makes a task easier, then it did its job - entering my 30s, my fingers are starting to get less nimble and I don't value absolute time savings as much.\n\nMany still might not have a use for her, but I think we should give Samsung a little credit for trying something new (really, you want Google to be the sole dominant player?). Forcing use to adopt the Bixby button might be a little too much, but in Samsung's perspective, how else to get real-world feedback? As we've seen, everyone will just dismiss Bixby as a \"me-too\" AI that we don't need if left all up to us.\n\nNow I'm even more excited about future AI. Just watching as Bixby runs through several menus deep to change a setting (in her sexy voice..to each their own?) was hypnotizing. I'm predicting Google and Siri will follow suit within a few years and have Bixby-levels of device-control on iphones, Pixel phones, at least. Then they're gonna advertise their improved AI as \"revolutionary.\"",

I was able to add a widget for it using Nova Launcher by doing the following.**\n\n* Press and hold on the home screen to create widget\n* At the very top there are Nova Launcher Widgets scroll to the right until you see \"Activities\" \n* Drag the \"Activities Widget\" to the home screen\n* A list of apps will load, scroll to the bottom and add \"Visual Voicemail\" (Two Clicks, one to open, then select Visual Voicemail from drop down)\n* Now you have a widget for Native Visual Voicemail on your Home Screen.\n\n**So here is a simple breakdown of all the things I needed to get Native Visual Voicemail working.**\n\n* I needed to enable \"Digits\" on my T-Mobile Account\n* I then needed enable \"Digits\" on my phone by going to Cloud and Accounts\" in settings. You will have to restart your phone for the settings to appear if this feature was not enabled on your phone. T-Mobile will send you a text with instructions on how to enable it so I won't elaborate too much as it is self explanatory. \n\n**Once I had Digits enabled on my phone I thought I was done because when I opened Native Visual Voicemail a brand new tutorial I had not seen before popped up, however VVM was still not working.**\n\n* At this point go ahead and download the \"Digits App\" for T-Mobile in the Play Store if your Native VVM is still not working.\n* Follow the prompts and enable Digits for your number.\n\n**After all that my VVM was/is working. I have since uninstalled the T-Mobile VVM App and the Digits App. It appears that for some reason I needed to install the Digits App to Officially get Digits turned on as whatever I did through my phone settings did not work. I don't know or understand it well enough to tell you why all these systems are tied in together or why you need to jump through hoops to get it working, I am just happy to finally be using the Native VVM App**   \n",

            "selftext": "**UPDATE: According to the developers this is a known bug and will be fixed with the next release!**\n\n-------\n     \nToday I discovered that the booking.com App is spamming network requests in the background on my phone.  \n\nI recommend that you uninstall the App from your device if you're not actively using it ATM, since it's wasting your battery and burns through your data limit.  \nAfter a couple of minutes of testing I saw an interesting  pattern in the booking.com App on my device:  \n[https://i.imgur.com/NuvTjWD.png](https://i.imgur.com/NuvTjWD.png)  \n  \n \nAs you can see in the image above, the App is requesting **3 different JSON resources every 30 seconds**. That is absolutely ridiculous. This happens when the device is on Wifi and when the device is in a mobile network.   \n  \nHere is a quick breakdown of the resources:  \nsqueak: 219 bytes  \nexperiments: 56656 bytes  \ncomponents: 1047 bytes  \n  \n56.56KB data usage every 30 seconds  \nThat's **113.12KB+ of data usage every minute**!  \n  \nThis happens when the device is being used (screen on), and also continues to happen a couple of minutes after the screen has been turned off. After a while with the screen being off the requests seem to stop until the device is unlocked again.  \n  \nThe data being sent to their servers contains: Android Version, User Version, Android device id, your language, what type of network you're connected to (wifi, etc.), authentication token, what type of display your device is using (xxxhhdpi, etc.)  \n   \n\nI'm logged into the App, my Android Version is 6.0.1, I'm using the latest version and this  continues to happen if I reboot my device.  \n  \nHope I could help some people with this post!\n\n",

We were also shocked to hear about the suspension of our Indiegogo account. We weren't expecting it.  \n\u00a0  \nLet\u2019s be frank: our team made a mistake in our choice of language and design presentation, leading to misconceptions and serious consequences that we tried to rectify by cleaning up our campaign and in interviews with the media.\u00a0But we didn\u2019t do enough.  \n\u00a0  \nThough our experience with Indiegogo started out on a positive foot with Indiegogo \u201cpoaching\u201d us from Kickstarter, using promises of free promotions and expert consultation, it ended with our campaign being abruptly discontinued without fair notice. We are currently in conversations with our legal counsel regarding Indiegogo\u2019s claims, process, and damages.  \n\u00a0  \nWe\u2019re so sorry to our fans that have shown nothing but support since the beginning.  \n\u00a0  \nBut Little Guys don\u2019t give up. They punch above their weight.  \n\n**What\u2019s next for frank.?**  \n  \nIn spite of this setback, we plan to push forward. Our mission is to introduce affordable smartphone technology to Canadians and Americans who no longer want to fork up thousands of dollars on a device.  \n  \nAnd we're going to\u00a0fulfill our commitment because we. are. NOT. backing. down.  \n\u00a0  \nThe Big Guys can\u2019t bully us.  \n  \nThroughout this journey, we've learned a tremendous amount and have found ways to better our process and lower our costs. We\u00a0continued to seek out new manufacturers and test alternate moulds and OEMs with the aim of reducing costs and increasing savings.  \n  \nIndiegogo may not have worked out but we aim to move forward with our commitment to getting you our product at cost-savings and in a shorter time period.\u00a0Please bear with us as we work out the kinks and formulate our next steps. We'll give you an update with details as soon as possible.  \n  \nWe\u2019ve requested our list of backers from Indiegogo in order to properly thank them but we\u2019ve yet to hear back from Indiegogo.\u00a0[Backer or not, please fill out this form in order to ensure you receive a discount when our product goes live through an online store](http://frankisaphone.us16.list-manage.com/track/click?u=47e5a09c2ab36d6d0910d6f42&id=393f49ddf6&e=9f944d7135).  \n\u00a0  \nSo, in the craziest of ways, thank you to the online community who tore our project apart; you simply supplied us with constructive criticism, an enormous amount of research, and an opportunity *to\u00a0help us help our Frankensteins*.  \n\u00a0  \nStay tuned as we finalize the details.  \nEverything will be available on our website.   \n\u00a0  \nThank you in advance for your patience throughout this whole roller-coaster of a journey.  \n\u00a0  \nYour frank. team  \nMo  \nFahd  \nSara",

I was hyped up with Google's post-apple-keynote advertisements and how colorful they've been, it's got me buzzing like I never have for Google products, but the leaks from the other day show the pixel 2 with no headphone jack, bezels on the non-XL, and the price is allegedly $849?? How is that competitive?\n\nIf these leaks are true, I think a lot of people will be jumping ship for the S8. As much as I love not having bloatware, it's $100 cheaper, the same processor, with a bigger screen and Samsung cameras have been phenomenal for a few years now. And my subjective opinion on the pixel 2 design is that it's just off.\n\nI'm still excited to see what happens on the 4th, because of whats been said about the home mini, but I think the pixel 2 will be a huge let-down.

Do you agree with this idea? Let's get some manufacturers on board?

I had to turn down phones like the Lenovo P2, Oukitel K10000, Xiaomi Redmi 4, due to Freedom Mobile requiring the UMTS Band 4. The only one I found that would support my carrier and met my requirements (excluding NFC, which will have to be added via the expandable micro sd slot) was the ZenFone Zoom 3. However it's using the snapdragon 625, even though the 630 and 660 have been out long before the phone was released. But apparently that's reserved for the Zenphone 4, which is out now, but unfortunately there is no 'big battery' option with those processors, despite being 70% more power efficient at for location services & during downloads on wifi, while still seeing a good overall efficiency bump.",

            "selftext": "Mine, so far, hasn't been great. Obviously, it's very generous that Google would offer a free *upgrade* for an out-of-warranty two-year-old phone, but the process hasn't been smooth so far.\n\nMy Pixel was scheduled to ship on the 15th, but as of the 16th, had not. A rep told me there was a delay at the warehouse and it would ship Monday. Fair enough.\n\nSo this morning, noting that it was still showing not shipped, I reached out again and was told that it *had* shipped, and the rep went so far as to promise it would arrive today, but couldn't provide a tracking number. So I called FedEx, and they verified that no packages have recently shipped to my address.\n\nConfused, I called Google again. The most recent rep also said it was scheduled to show up today, but when I told him FedEx said they didn't have packages for me in their system, he put me on hold for about 20 minutes, then came back, obviously flustered, to say his manager was on it and would call me later. This was about four hours ago. \n\nSo my phone may or may not have shipped and nobody can tell me where it is, which is a little bit annoying. Again, I'm happy they were so willing to help, but the process has been rough.\n\nHas anyone else had a similar experience? Did your Pixel ship on schedule? Has it arrived? Has the hold on your credit card been dropped yet? How are you liking it vs. your old 6P?\n\n**Edit:** Oh, also. What color is your 6P and what color is your replacement Pixel? I'd hoped black would be an option but they told me I could only get silver because \"it is a limitation.\" I assume that means inventory considerations or something?",

            "selftext": "Apple introduced a (proprietary) Bluetooth based (?) direct connection for hearing aids in 2014 which not only allows to control the devices but also allows high quality direct streaming of music and calls to the devices. (-> https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201466)\n\nWith Android devices up to today only controlling works with a couple of devices (and not very well according to the reviews on the play store -> https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.widex.falcon) and streaming works (supposedly) only with a single device using an energy draining Bluetooth work around using an outdated standard (-> https://www.phonak.com/de/de/ueber-uns/direkte-drahtlose-anbindung.html). This is NO proper solution for hearing aids which have to work all day long.\n\nMost of the available solutions use a huge bluetooth breakout box (usually twice as large as a car key fob) to convert the signal to some super low quality FM signal with constant drop outs resulting in two wireless connections and three devices just to listen to music.\n\nThe importance of this comes from the fact that headphones often don't work well with hearing aids and the aids themselves are already really good headphones. Apple proved with partners, that the technology is possible and feasible, yet three years later, it is still non existent on Android. Additionally, the technology could be licensed from Apple and the Bluetooth 5 standard seems to have a standard for hearing aids. Yet, the new Samsung S8 with Bluetooth 5 capability does not support direct streaming.\n\nWhat do think about that and what could be done to improve the situation? I would love to hear some feedback from the Android community.",

I'll start by saying I keep my phone's stock, no rooting (don't have the effort like I did with the Note 3/4) and I got the Note 8 early yesterday. \n\nStaright off the bat the phone is nowhere near as smooth as the OP, opening apps, swiping through the app drawer there are definitely frame drops and a tiny bit of lag, nothing too serious but it's definitely there. \n\nThe iris scanner has really impressed me to the point where I don't even have fingerprint login enabled at the moment, the iris scanner is fantastic, really quick, and works in the dark. \n\nSamsung's software isn't that bad, I haven't been tempted to stick nova on it yet but I do wish I could just use icon packs from the play store rather than their own dreadful Samsung store. Having said that I was able to uninstall most of their bloat including Samsung pay and penup whatever the hell that is. The far left bixby page still lags when swiping over to it which for a \u00a3900 phone is unacceptable.\n\nIt's a bit too soon to comment on battery life but it wasn't hard to beat my average SOT from the OP which was 2.5 hours. Today was a normal work day, currently on 3 hours SOT with 30% battery left so not dreadful.\n\nThe aspect ratio was one of the things I was most looking forward to, I use split screen multiple times a day so the extra length has been really really handy.\n\nSo overall I've been very impressed, not sure it's worth the money in fact I am almost certain it's not but the two things I had issues with previously (battery life and a small screen) seem to have been resolved.

            "selftext": "**TL;DR:** [Google Play Store link: Paper for reddit](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hdeva.reddit)\n\nI have created an application which makes it easy for you to pick a wallpaper from one of the [SfwPornNetwork](https://www.reddit.com/r/sfwpornnetwork/wiki/network) subreddit. The app is ad supported, with an in-app purchase to remove all ads forever. The main features are the following:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n###Browse\n\nPick a wallpaper from any subs from the SfwPornNetwork, or categories. Additionally, I have created a [Featured](https://www.reddit.com/user/PaperForReddit/m/featuredporn/) category, which I think works best for the app. The contents of this multi is up for discussion.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n###Automatic wallpaper\n\nEnable the automatic wallpaper feature in Settings, and get a new wallpaper based on your preferred category every:\n\n- week\n- three days\n- day\n- twelve hours\n\n&nbsp;\n\n###Theme\n\nWant a dark mode? Go for it! Don't like the thumbnails? Pick the list or card view instead.\n\nThe app scales respectfully for every device. For example, on a Pixel C in landscape mode, you will see a permanent navigation drawer, with three columns of cards. On a smaller phone? The navigation drawer is hidden by default, and for more clarity, only one column of cards will be visible.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n###Oreo\n\nThe app targets Oreo, and as such, adheres to every restriction.\n\n- the automatic wallpapers are scheduled with [Firebase job dispatcher](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-jobdispatcher-android), your phone won't wake up and drain battery when it doesn't need to\n- the app has two quick settings toggle, for the *Top post* and for a *Random post* from your preferred category\n- the app also supports launcher shortcuts for the same *Top post* and *Random post*\n- adaptive icon support, if your device and launcher supports it (with a slightly different background, than with the standard icon)\n- you can receive notifications if your wallpaper has been changed automatically, supporting notification channels beginning with Oreo\n\n&nbsp;\n\n###Blacklist\n\nDon't want your posts to appear in the app? Or just one post? I'm sorry to hear that. Send me a PM, and I will blacklist you.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n###TODO\n\nThis project is a pet project for me, my main objective was to write something purely in Kotlin. If there is interest from the community, I will keep working on Paper. I have some things planned, for example:\n\n- manual cropping (currently the app crops the center of any picture)\n- [Cloud Vision crop hints](https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/crop-hints) for automatic wallpapers\n- some UI improvements\n- android TV support\n- android wear support (possibly a watchface)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf you like what you see, [download Paper](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hdeva.reddit) and try it out. I would be happy to hear about your feedback, feature request, bug (less happy about that, but it is unavoidable).\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*Disclaimer: Paper for reddit is an unofficial app. Reddit and the Reddit alien logo, trademark and trade dress are registered trademarks owned by Reddit Inc.*\n",

To get the server working with Google Assistant, you need to expose the localhost port you selected to the world. I chose to use ngrok for this, and it works well (just don't turn it off, or you'll get a different URL upon restarting) Once you have the ngrok URL, you can create an IFTTT applet triggered by Google Assistant phrases, connected to the Webhooks. Follow the JSON structure described in the repo readme, and you're good to go\n\nComment with questions, and I'll answer them to the best of my knowledge.

With one exception, everyone I know (including myself) have Hebrew names. For compatibility purposes, and readability to others, I keep everything in English/the English alphabet. However, I obviously won't translate names. For example, my sister's name in Hebrew means \"grape\", but I'm not going to write her name as \"grape\", I have her name spelled in English letters, according to the Hebrew pronounciation.  I'd really appreciate the ability to specify pronounciations of non English names.\n\nThe same thing applies to Google maps - I am unable to do any sort of navigation to any specific place, because Google will simply not recognise the names. I can type them out without switching to Hebrew letters.\n\nI'm certain that Arabs, and Japanese people suffer from the same issues (the Chinese would too, but Google isn't available in China)",

            "selftext": "I picked up the Note 8 on Friday, Sept. 15th, and wanted to share my initial thoughts about the phone.  \n  \nThe good:  \n1. Amazing screen. Perfect size, rich colors, deep dark blacks.  \n2. Sound / speakers are fantastic.  \n3. Fast and smooth interactions. No stutters or jankiness.  \n4. Samsung pay is very cool, and I'm actually using it. The trick where it works with any swipe terminal is cool.  \n5. Samsung Touchwiz customizations are kind of nice, I actually like the ability to theme easily. Having said that I'm using Nova launcher, which kind of levels the playing field.  \n  \nThe bad:  \n1. The pictures I take do not look as good as the ones from the Pixel XL that I traded in. Maybe I'm doing something wrong? I've actually installed the 'modded' Google camera APK with HDR+, which improves things a little.  \n2. The fingerprint sensor location is difficult and stupid. The Pixel XL had it perfect.  \n3. Bixby is useless, so I've disabled it. Still trying to figure out what to do with the button.  \n  \nThat's it for now, I'm sure my opinion will change as I use the phone. I'm on Verizon so I took advantage of the trade-in deal which gave my $480 for my Pixel XL.  When the new Pixel XL comes out I might sell the Note 8 on Swappa and jump ship if I can't figure out how to get better results out of the camera.",

            "score": 0, 
            "selftext": "Over the years I've seen countless posts and articles from users switching from one platform to the other. I've always read them because it's great to see their reasons behind the switch and their experiences during it. I've never really been a platform loyalist, being more loyal to my own wants, needs, and experiences. That means I will switch if it makes sense. And after 7 and a half years on Android I am finally doing just that. I'm hopeful that my reasoning and experiences will be useful to others as well. This is NOT meant as post to praise Apple and to bash Android. Both have an amazing list of positives and negatives and each individual user will need to make their own assessment. As I have just today ordered my iPhone 8, this Part 1 post will focus on the reasons behind my decision to switch operating systems. Part 2 will likely be around the first week of November as I detail my experiences and how I ultimately feel about the switch. Who knows, perhaps I'll hate the change and switch back.\n\nI'll lead off in what I want from a phone. I have always admired and respected Apple's attention to detail in hardware (except the \"you're holding it wrong\" fiasco). And as a user of smaller phones, I have always appreciated that Apple was able to have class leading performance in a phone that still can be comfortably used in one hand by just about anyone. But I have always preferred Android's more feature-rich operating system and available hardware features. To me the ideal phone was an iPhone running Android.\n\nMost of us will disagree on which operating system is actually superior. But where we cannot disagree is that Android-based devices have typically led the way with hardware-based innovation. Android-based phones were moving on with HD video capture right as the iPhone finally got the ability to shoot video in the first place. Android phones integrated front-facing cameras before the iPhone. NFC was added in 2010 with tap-and-pay following shortly thereafter. OIS was a major feature of some Android devices. And unlike the fingerprint reader, most of these upgrades did not need Apple to adopt and perfect them before Android followed suit (though Apple did totally kick ass with Touch ID WAY before Android caught up).\n\nBut I quickly realized that most of the innovation was happening in software, not hardware. As a result I started to drift towards Nexus devices for their longer-term software support and more consistent update schedule relative to other Android devices. The Nexus 5X is my current phone and it is roughly 2 years old now. It's still supported, getting Android Oreo. Really, I should be able to get another year out of it. But the hardware was a mistake and it's often referred to by many as the worst Nexus. It's not as fluid as other Nexus devices, even the Nexus 5 and Nexus 6 that preceded it. So it's time for an upgrade for me. Additionally, it's just a bit large for my liking. I think that the [Essential and iPhone X (THIS IS A SIZE COMPARISON LINK] (https://www.phonearena.com/phones/size#/phones/size/Apple-iPhone-X,Essential-Phone,Google-Nexus-5X/phones/10414,10548,9593) are just about perfect, though they are very much beta devices to me and will need another revision at least to get to where I'd want them to be.\n\nAnd by now many readers would probably wonder why I don't just get a Google Pixel. Surely it is exactly what I always wanted - an iPhone with Android on it. Well it is, but with some caveats. First, I always saw Nexus phones as \"next year's iPhone,\" with their advanced hardware. The Nexus S added NFC. The Nexus 4 had wireless charging. The Nexus 5 added OIS. But if that's true, then the Pixel is very much \"last year's iPhone.\" The Pixel last year didn't advance Android much, IMO. It was basically my Nexus 5X, in a prettier and slightly smaller package, with the expected annual bump in internal specs. It was priced equivalent to the iPhone 7. And it was very much comparable to it, IMO. It lacked OIS, but the camera performance was still better per most sources. It even bested the iPhone 7 Plus's camera, outside of portrait mode. And hey, it still had a headphone jack! But it lacked the IP67 certification of the iPhone 7 as well. Overall they were comparable because Apple really didn't move the needle much with the iPhone 7 over the 6s. And I wasn't going to upgrade after one year. Surely the eventual Pixel 2 would be a real leap forward for Google, right?\n\nWell, that's hard to tell. Due to leaks we think we know most of the key points of the new Pixel, but we can't say for absolute certainty until it's announced. But all indications are that it's last year's Pixel, with the expected spec bump (Snapdragon 821 to 835). In fact, the two big changes appear to be IP6x certification and the removal of the headphone jack...IE, two of the biggest changes from the iPhone 6s to the 7. It likely won't have OIS, and it won't have wireless charging. It is very much last year's iPhone.\n\nAnd therein lies my problem. I always felt that the best phone would be an iPhone's hardware with Android as the OS. But it seems that Google doesn't care to innovate in hardware. They're all too happy setting the iPhone as the benchmark, and replicating it next year. I fully believe that the smaller Pixel 3 in 2018 will add OIS and wireless charging. But you can get that in an iPhone today. And what will next year's base model iPhone have? For the first time, I'm very confident that next year's iPhone will have more features than next year's phone direct from Google.\n\nNow this is where I'm at. I'm going to give Apple a chance. I ordered an iPhone 8 (carrier unlocked model, of course, like all of my modern phones) and delivery is expected to be the first week of October. I will come back roughly a month after that and detail my experiences, what I like about the change, what I dislike, and whether I stick with it or go crawling back to Android.\n\nThat said, I do have one area I'm expecting to be a significant downgrade. I absolutely L-O-V-E my LG Watch Style. I've been using Android Wear for 3 years and I prefer it to the Apple Watch in terms of hardware and software. I prefer round watches that look like a watch. But I plan to go all in, so I will be getting an Apple Watch a month or two after the iPhone, if I'm happy with the change.\n\nAnyway, I look forward to your feedback. As I'm cross-posting this on two subreddits that I feel the subject is relevant too, it will be interesting to see the diverse feedback that this post may generate.",

Once your car is on and has failed to connect to your phone...turn bluetooth back on. On my stereo this causes everything to connect...phone...media...Android Auto will launch(and not crash). \n\nThis isn't an ideal solution for the long term but it is at least preventing me from scrolling through so many menus and rebooting devices.

Here's the [article](http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/7170556) from 2015. I uninstalled the Webview updates & disabled the Webview as a whole, since using old version meant weaker security. Note, before disabling Webview, you must have chrome installed on your device!! After using and testing after more than 72 hours, I have found no problems. Also, I was using the latest Webview version: 62.0.3202.19. Hope this helps anyone, who is having the same issue!",

My past three phones: Galaxy S2, S4 and Nexus 6P have all been purchased new within a few months of release and I've held onto them for 2 years or more. The first two were kept up to date with custom ROMs but I couldn't be bothered with that anymore after two phones so I got a Nexus.\n\nI've always thought that my phones slow down after a couple of years not only because of hardware degradation: battery, flash storage, but because I wanted the latest software and this required newer CPUs or more ram or better optimisations that weren't being supported on older devices.\n\nSo I'm curious to know if anyone has experienced, or has opinions on, what a 1st Gen Pixel would be like in 2018, if it was bought new in 2016 or new in 2017?\n\nWould it be the same because the hardware and software is the same at the same point in time or would there actually be some difference because the Pixel bought in 2016 has 1 extra year of use under its belt?\n\nWould the people that have used the phone for only one year want to upgrade because the phone is already 2 years old?\n\nThanks!",

            "selftext": "It started a few versions ago, when Google started \"bundling\" certain app activities in Android OS and Android System. Now you may see Facebook use in the low single digit percentages of battery life, even if in reality it may be using a lot more but that usage gets bundled in those two categories I mentioned above. \n\nThen because users can't do anything but shrug at the Android OS/System usage, they just complain that their phone's battery sucks or that \"Android phones have unreliable battery life\" as I've seen in some recent comments around here, thus hurting the image of *all* Android devices with other potential buyers.\n\nIn Android 8 Google has even removed Android OS and Android system categories from the default battery stats page, and now you have to go to the 3-dot menu to see it (which isn't that intuitive of an action).\n\nI keep wondering if Google is doing this on purpose to hide how much its own apps and services are using so that users don't take their pitchforks out when they see just how much energy \"Google apps and services\" are using on their Android phone.\n\nThis is also what makes me not so optimistic about the background restriction thing. If Google keeps making battery stats less and less transparent with each new version, then I can't trust them that they will actually stop their own background activities too much.\n\nGoogle should be striving for more transparency for the user, not less (on this issue, but also others like how users are tracked on Android, how much Google could change remotely on users' Android phones if it wanted to, and so on). \n\nIf *we* can see what exactly is using more battery life than it should, then we can all report it and force that change for the better, and ultimately it will make all Android phones better. Yes, sometimes we may see that Google's own Android apps drain a lot of battery life, and Google may experience a temporary pain in having to fix that. However, that will ultimately lead to better/leaner Google apps, which should be a *good thing*.\n\nSide note: I wonder if Project Treble will both decrease Android's overall performance as well as the battery life, because everything will go through an extra layer, which will require extra processing and extra battery life as a consequence, and whether or not this is why Google is hiding Android OS/System battery life in Android 8+. Either way, continuing to make the battery stats page less and less useful to users is not the solution.",

There were about 20-30 people around me.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/BUrHZ\n\nThe ones in red (High Risk) were these models:\n\n* [Huawei P9 lite](http://www.gsmarena.com/huawei_p9_lite-7983.php)\n* [Samsung S5610](http://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_s5610-4191.php)\n* [Samsung C3530](http://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_c3530-3668.php)\n\nNot sure how reliable the scanner is when scanning devices around you, but seeing the video of how easy it is to take over a device by exploiting this vulnerability and the fact that a lot of devices (with EOL) will never receive an update (unless they flash a custom rom containing the security patch), it doesn't look like this situation is going to change anytime soon.\n\n**EDIT:**\n\nThe app in question is [BlueBorne Vulnerability Scanner by Armis](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.armis.blueborne_detector&hl=en), however as stated in the comments, it's not very reliable because it probably uses different tricks to determine if a phone is vulnerable or not.\n\nOn the phone that it's scanning, it just checks the security patch level if it's from September or not. Not sure how it determines if nearby devices are vulnerable. Maybe it looks up the phone model number on gsmarena and checks if it has reached end of life :)\n\nAnyway, if you're unsure if you're phone is vulnerable or not, it's best to completely disable Bluetooth as the exploit also works even if it's not set to Discoverable.",

            "selftext": "I see all around the internet that this phone is not a huge upgrade over the S7, just a small incremental improvement. NOT TRUE. The S7 had so many flaws and this phone address just about all of them. Maybe other than the very little boost in performance this phone is an upgrade in everyway compared to S7.\n\n \n\nScreen - Seriously a HUGE screen. How does this improve upon the previous generation other than size and screen to body ratio? Well, the reds. Oled panels are known for their wide color gamut above sRGB. But S7 in particular had great greens and blues but lacked reds. In fact the red gamut is worse than an S3, probably the worst red gamut in any Samsung flagship oleds. I've always felt S7's reds were more of a orange color. S8 has much deeper reds that really improves the display experience. Now DCI-P3 and HDR.\n\n \n\nPerformance - Well now the iPhone 8 is out, this section is probably useless for the next 2 years. Not a big difference from S7 can't feel a big speed upgrade. My S7 could get over 6000 in geekbench, then throttles down to 5400 after a few runs. This gets 6600. But doesn't throttle. Prolonged performance is massively improved, most noticible in game frame rates not dropping after 5 min. \n\n \n\nCamera: Stills - Was considered a minor upgrade by many. NOT TRUE. This camera is a real step up over S7. It improves on the issues S7 suffered. First of all, clarity. S8's photos have more details despite the same resolution and photo size, most visible in texts. This fixes the worsened details going from 16mp to 12mp (S6-S7). Megapixel bump without the megapixel bump if you know what I mean. The dynamic range has improved. This was my biggest gripe with S7's camera. Everyone on S7's sub got defensive of their precious baby and called me blind. Seriously my old S4 could get more dynamic range, I didn't even want to shoot with S7 anymore even though I bought it for its camera. In any high contrast scene the photos just look shit. Thank goodness S8 improved this. The noise level in photos especially lowlight has decreased, making much more pleasant photos. Overall camera is noticible bump.\n\n \n\nCamera: videos - In 30 fps videos the dynamic range is improved like in stills. In 60fps and 240 fps, now it ACTUALLY CAN FOCUS ON A CLOSE SUBJECT. The focus is still not that great, definitely much much worse than my 6s Plus. But now at least it's usable compared to S7. Seriously how can you guys even defend S7's camera, look at all the flaws.\n\n \n\nDesign - Biggest upgrade probably. Many considered S7's design good. I thought both S7 and edge's design were both not that great and a downgrade from S6, didn't post anything about it cos you know, no one wants to hear their new phone is shit. Firstly the S7, softest aluminium used in any phone, period. It gets dings from plastics! I was so shocked coming from a 6s Plus, I mean I dropped this facedown & in the corner, nude, without a scratch. The matte chamfered edges at the top went from fairly sharp to blunt from just taking it in and out of my pocket. The glass on the back had a gap between it and the frame (not just my model, all display units have it, including my friends'), not a seamless transition like the iPhone and extremely unergomomic. The edge has a terrible green tint on the two sides thanks to that huge curve. And the aluminium frame sticks out on the 2 sides like a sharp knive that can cut your hands off. S8's design addresses all of this. Pretty much seamless transition of glass and metal. Smooth all around the phone. A smaller screen curve. Round corners of the display for aesthetics. Definitely major upgrade.\n\n \n\nAudio - Do I need to go on about how rubbish the speaker was on the S7, quiet, muffled, tinny. It was just S6's speaker, with no upgrades and now has to filter through a waterproof membrane. It's simply shit. S8's is still single bottom firing, but it is louder, clearer, less tinny, and more bass. I don't know how Samsung tuned it but it sounds way nicer. 32 bit DAC, do I really need to review this.\n\n \n\nVibration motor - My god that motor was a piece of shit on S7, my previous S4 had way more clear and distinct vibration than S7. S4 is like 60% similar to the taptic engine on iP7, S7 is 0%. S7's vibrations felt like the entire phone frame was vibrating with it, the vibrations were muffled and soft. I had to turn off keyboard vibrations cos it felt like shit. S8 users here will obviously know how nice the motor is on the S8. Sharp, clear, distinct. Not as good as taptic engine but at least you can actually use it in the keyboard. My god it's a pleasure to type on the S8.\n\n \n\nSecurity - Iris scanner + updated fps scanner (facial doesn't really count). Certainly nice to be able to unlock your phone when its wet using the iris scanner. Fps placement definitely not the best, not that much of a pain in the ass most reviewers are suggesting though. I do occasionly smudge the camera lens. Fps is a little bit more accurate than S7, not that big of an improvement, one thing I dislike about this phone.\n\n \n\nBixby - Seriously the best feature of this phone. Use it all the time especially the button. Jk, only trigger it when I think I'm pressing the volume buttons. \n\n \n\nBattery life - Reg S7 (exynos) to S8+ (exynos) was a big jump. Went from ~5h SOT to 9-10h SOT, no black theme or such, 1440p and performance mode, only disabled a few apps in settings and turned off a few features. But mostly I'm happy about the long term battery capacity span of S8. According to Samsung this is massively upgraded over S7.\n\n \n\nI would just like to point out that this phone is actually built like a tank. My phone got stepped on the first day I got it. Couldn't find any damage. Maybe the oled display did help, an LCD probably would've got damaged cos you know, it doesnt flex and has too many layers. There's a another advantage of oled, durability.",

            "selftext": "TLDR: I think Samsung is experimenting with DeX so it can be implemented as a native environment for the next Galaxy tablet device.\n\nOkay, so we all know that Samsung experiments with laptop/tablet devices a lot:\n\n- Samsung released Galaxy Tab S3 which was supposed to provide laptop-like experience. They released type cover which was not that bad after all. The only problem was the Android ecosystem which is quite not good when it comes to multitasking. Samsung was definitely lacking on this field, but they were clearly trying to nail the idea.\n- Samsung also released the Galaxy TabPro S - 12-inch 2in1 Windows tablet. Its release was not a disaster, but the lack of marketing and Surface Pro kinda killed it. I'm sure not many of you knew such a device exists in the first place.\n\nAt the moment - Android fails when it comes to the multitasking. You can connect bluetooth keyboard and mouse to the tablet, but productivity is far behind Windows devices. DeX is something that tries to change that. Developers now have the tools to make their applications work with DeX. When time comes, Samsung is going to release its killer device.\n\nCan you imagine Galaxy Tab S4 the way I do?\n\n- Smaller bezels so you can fit 12-inch display\n- Top-notch hardware (as always with Samsung Galaxy devices)\n- Type cover accessory (touchpad included)\n- S-Pen included (all the features of Note 8 included)\n- An option to switch between regular tablet mode and DeX desktop environment\n\nWell... did I just describe Microsoft Surface? Possibly, but there are a lot of things that Samsung will benefit from:\n\n- ARM architecture is quite efficient when it comes to performance/power usage combo.\n- This means you can keep the weight of the tablet at around 1.10 pounds (500g). This is something that is not possible with Windows 10 x86 architecture. You might do that, but it won't be as efficient as ARM if you want to keep the weight below 500g.\n- Have you tried using Surface in a tablet mode, lying down and holding it? It's way more a laptop device than it is a tablet. It's super heavy.\n- Note 8's S-Pen tracking is far superior from Surface's.\n\nAll that makes it far more perfect for travel / daily usage than most of the today's devices.\n\n- You won't need to worry about carrying another power adapter with you. You could simply use your lightweight phone adapter. Hey, I guess we've been waiting for this day quite long time already, right?\n- Top software, hardware and OLED display\n- Lightweight to comfortably use in tablet mode\n- Efficient enough for being a daily driver for most of consumers looking for lightweight laptop\n\nI simply can't wait for this to become reality. Hope you guys follow the idea too :).",

            "selftext": "I received Mi A1 yesterday after orderimg it from Flipkart (Indian e-commerce website) on the day it went to sale (12th Sept). Here are my initial impressions of the phone.  \n\n- Build quality is on par with Moto G5s Plus. Coming from Nexus 6p, A1 does feel like a downgrade but not much. Yes the phone is a bit slippery but overall a very good device at this price point (\u20b915000)  \n\n- The fingerprint sensor is a tad bit above than what I was accustomed to on 6p. It works amazingly fast. Felt quicker than 6p's  \n\n- So far the battery backup is good. Got around 6hrs of SoT but then again its too soon to judge battery life  \n\n- Fast charging didn't felt fast atleast compared to 6p. I got 50% charge in 1 hr whereas 6p used to charge upto 60-65% in the same time  \n\n- I miss on screen navigation bar but I can live with capavitive one's. Only thing that's bothering me is getting used to the inverted layout (back button on the right and recents on left)  \n\n- Coming to software, it is indeed stock Android with Mi Feedback app installed. Mi Store, Mi remote are opt in as in if you want them installed, then you can do it during intial setup else they won't be imstalled  \n\n- 1 major gripe that I have is there are 2 contact apps. And also the Dialer app version is 4.0 whereas it was 11.0 on 6p and I'm not able to install updates on top this one  \n\n- There is one feature deep hidden in Settings -> Data Usage. If you press the overflow menu (3dots) on the ActionBar then there's an option called \"App network access\". Here you can toggle data network and wifi access for individual app. It kinda works like a firewall. Ads are still loaded but the app can't connect to the internet. I didn't see this on my 6p so I'm not sure it's available on other stock devices  \n\nI know I didnt speak about camera because I'm not a camera guy. All in all, it's a great device at this price point and if Google and Xiaomo stay true to their word with update to Android P, I can see myself using this device until it's display gives up on me (had 4 previous phones all with either broken display or the digitizer being fried due to water damage)",

I really like material design when it was introduced, but since then, there have been small design tweaks that just don't look good IMO. Like...\n\n1. The stark, edge to edge notifications on the lock screen and notification shade.\n\n2. The circles icons of pixel launcher. And the folder icon of pixel launcher. \n\n3. The pill shaped Google button in pixel launcher.\n\n4. The music notifications on the lock screen that change color based on the album art. It often looks really bad because the wallpaper of the lock screen becomes the album art too. \n\n5. Every apps interactive lock screen notifications have different button layouts and icons, and behave differently when you expand. I love androids openness and flexibility, but this is one place where it could use some order.\n\n6. The placement of the settings icon underneath the Quick action icons in the notification shade. It's a smaller scale than the other icons too. Just why??\n\n7. The stock keyboard is just so fucking ugly. I don't know where to begin.\n\nIt's all of these things, and other stuff like jerky animations, that have me disappointed in the visual design. I love the way Android works and it's feature set, that's why I switch over from back iOS, but I really miss the clean, smooth, polished visual design of iOS. It makes the experience so much more enjoyable. So much of Android UI seems like it wasn't thought through too much. ",

            "selftext": "**Background**  \nIn June, Anker's newly-founded smart audio brand [Zolo](https://zoloaudio.com/) announced their first wireless earbuds on [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1792059063/liberty-the-first-zero-compromise-total-wireless-e/description), including support for all three major assistants (Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant). However, after successful funding, they removed almost all traces of Google Assistant. Compare the current campaign page and website to archived versions, and you'll note how the only mention of Google Assistant remaining is in the promo video (which is really hard to replace on Kickstarter). In the last days, they have also removed support for Alexa from their website.\nHowever, when asked about it in comments and on social media, they state that there were no issues regarding Google Assistant, and that we should stay tuned for updates.\n \n**Anker & Google?**  \nNow, at IFA, [Zolo and Google annonced Mojo](https://www.blog.google/products/assistant/your-google-assistant-is-coming-to-new-speakers-and-more/), one of the first third-party speakers with Google Assistant. A blogpost on Zolo's blog was posted and then taken down again a few days later, as was the [product page for Mojo](https://zoloaudio.com/pages/mojo) (also linked in the Google blog post). Something's going on.\n\n**The theory**  \nAfter Anker launched their Kickstarter campaign, Google may have contacted them about the Bisto program. As launch was (as is still) slated for October 2017, the lower-cost Zolo Liberty earbuds would make great launch devices for the Bisto program alongside the higher-priced Quiet Comfort II and the new Pixels, also slated for an October launch. Anker agreed and started working on implementing bisto to their hardware, removing earlier mentions of Assistant to keep this a secret. To comply with some sort of bisto guidelines, they have now also removed their standalone Alexa support from the headphones, putting the Liberty+ on par with the Quiet Comfort II.\nWe're pretty sure more there will be multiple Bisto headphones, and the recent leaks of Bose's QC2 have made it clear that [Google won't be building them themselves](http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/09/06/google-app-v7-11-beta-suggests-next-android-version-8-1-adds-battery-levels-bisto-headphones-prepares-tweak-user-defined-actions-apk-teardown/). Besides, it would very much make sense to have some sort wireless earbuds in the bisto family at launch to counter Samsung's IconX and of course Apple's AirPods, given the new Pixels will likely not have a headphone jack.\n\nWhat's your take on this?",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone! So this is probably my first post here for a very, very long time now, and after a rough re-launch a few weeks ago (with the Pro version not updating, dealing with the people who made Swipe Fast for Facebook, and all-in-all getting the app back to the stability of where it used to be), I'm proud to finally do an official re-launch of the app here on this subreddit with the news of the latest update (7.1).\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI know a lot of you probably haven't been following us over at r/swipeforfacebook , and I am sure some of you might still be wondering about the reason why Swipe had disappeared for a little while, [so click here for a quick link if you want to read up on it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/swipeforfacebook/comments/6oyep7/july_23_2017_the_state_of_swipe_for_facebook/).\n\nTL;DR: A bad business investment, a bad breakup, and crippling depression while I was trying to find my way back. I'm doing better now though through the help of my friends, family, and all the people over at r/swipeforfacebook.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBut anyway, let's get that out of the way and get to why we're here today. I'm proud to be finally getting back, and there are so many new additions to the app I'd love to share with you. 7.1 brings so many new \"firsts\" to Swipe (on top of the plethora that came with the 7.0 update) that have AFAIK haven't been implemented in other Facebook alternatives as of yet. I'm hoping you'll love them! \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Obligatory links**\n\n- **[Swipe for Facebook](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.happening.studios.swipeforfacebookfree)**\n- **[Swipe for Facebook Pro](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.happening.studios.swipeforfacebookpro)**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Oh and to commemorate this relaunch, Swipe (Pro key via In-app purchase) and Swipe Pro will be 50% OFF for the weekend.**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo without further ado, here's what's new this week:\n\n#**NEW FEATURES/IMPROVEMENTS**\n\n**NEW Swipeable Image Viewer**\n\n[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KwuWEt0jqI)\n\nSwipe through all photos in any album, anywhere (mostly). The New Image Viewer also now supports profiles and descriptions, allowing you to jump straight into the poster's timeline at any time. I believe Swipe's new image viewer is leagues above any other available out there and should allow the media viewing experience to be all the more better.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**NEW Floating PIP Videos**\n\n[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FK9z2pZP00A)\n\nBrowse your news feed or any posts in-app while watching videos, just like you can on YouTube. Simply open the video as normal, and then from the top menu, you can press the PIP button (it's right next to the download button). Continuing on with improvements in media viewing, I believe this is another first and should be a welcome addition to the app.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**NEW Mark all notifications as read**\n\n[Image](https://imgur.com/a/6oo9E)\n\nI don't even know why I (or anyone else) haven't thought of this before. Swipe is now the first app available (including the official apps) that have a \"clear all notifications\" button, just like you can on desktop.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**NEW Look & Feel Bottom Tab Options**\n\n[Images](https://imgur.com/a/PfFhE)\n\nDue to popular request, new look & feel options without the tab text have been added for the following: Swipe (Bottom Tabs), Facebook iOS, and Google Plus. Non-text options are annotated by \"NT\".\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**MASSIVELY Improved initial startup speed/smoothness**\n\nNotifications are now loaded almost instantly when the app is restarted without the need for any secondary requests. The friend request and more tabs are now only updated when needed/manually. This massively improve startup speed and smoothness.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**MASSIVELY improved caching abilities**\n\nThe improved speed you find in Swipe is all thanks again to the caching and native views introduced in Swipe 7.0. I'm so glad to have been able to made the jump to native views and caching in Swipe, as even today, there aren't any other apps that come even close when it comes to loading speed.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[For those of you who also missed the 7.0 update, you can check out all the new things the 7.0 update (chatheads, native/cacheable views, filtered search, etc.) here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/swipeforfacebook/comments/6uhd71/swipe_for_facebook_70_is_back_introducing/)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**First time hearing about Swipe for Facebook? Here are the highlights:**\n\n- Facebook & Messenger in just one app\n- Messenger Chatheads - access your messages while using other apps\n- PIP Videos - watch Facebook videos while you browse your News Feed\n- Facebook Widgets - let your notifications and messages live on your home screen\n- Block intrusive Facebook ads\n- Sort your news feed by Most Recent\n- Mark all notifications as read\n- Save what matters most with Swipe's bookmarks\n- Gorgeous Material Design themes with hand-picked color palettes\n- Automatic day/night theming\n- Intuitive layouts with top and bottom bar options\n- Take control of your notifications with filtering and quiet hours\n- Download images and videos\n- Control your privacy with PIN and Fingerprint Lock\n- Available in 30 different languages!\n\n**Swipe Pro unlocks:**\n\n- Facebook Ad Blocking\n- Messenger Chathead themes\n- Widget themes\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThanks again to everyone that's contributed to bug reports and for the kind words of support from everyone since the unofficial relaunch last month. You guys have been absolutely amazing! \n\nOther upcoming feature requests I've gotten that I'm already working on: more theming options, more options when it comes to \"Material Design\", a theme color picker - all of these and other style/theme related stuff are being worked on and will possibly be out for when 7.2.0 when that comes out.\n\nI'd also like to take this opportunity to hear of more bug reports that may have not been posted on r/swipeforfacebook.

Is that what he's talking about? Does wireless charging constantly send electricity to the charger/coil even if nothing is charging on it? \n\nHow much energy does this really waste? I'm thinking of my electric bill, and I'm assuming it's probably basically negligible, right? I'm all for conservation/ecofriendliness - hell I drive a (semi-) electric car - but at least to me, it seems like there's no way this could be a big deal. \n\nIs this even what he's talking about, or am I way off base?

            "selftext": "So, I've been a Nexus die-hard almost ever since I got into Android phones. My first phone was a Motorola RAZR M, good enough phone for a first but as a natural fiddler with technology I quickly knew I would need something more suited to my needs. I then got my first Nexus phone, a Nexus 4, and rooted it almost straight away. Ever since then I've been through two Nexus 5, a Nexus 5x and now I'm typing this on a Moto G5 Plus. \n\nBattery life has never been a huge concern for me, I've always preferred to have the fastest processor or latest software updates or best camera. Recently though, my Nexus 5x succumbed to the now infamous bootloop issue and because it was rooted and running a custom ROM, it wasn't covered by warranty so I had to go back to my old Nexus 5. The 5x didn't have the best battery life, I was averaging about 3 hrs SoT but it was getting me to the end of the day so believe me when I say the battery life on my Nexus 5 was *atrocious*. I never checked stats because I was too scared, but you're looking at being on about 10% by 12pm with only regular usage. I'd estimate about 1hr 30m of SoT.\n\nI couldn't deal with this, so I promptly saved up for the G5 Plus because my sister has one and I know she gets great battery life. As I'm sitting here typing this with 30% left and 6 hours and 17 minutes of SoT, I have to say, battery is now my biggest priority. My phone can call, Snapchat, play music and watch movies, but most importantly *it makes it to the end of the day*, and if I forget to charge overnight, it's no big deal. I went to bed one time with it at 31% and when I woke up it was still on 31% and lasted me the rest of day until I was able to get home to a charger.  \n\nAnyone else feel this way about battery life? I think it's far and away the most important part of a phone for me, because as my friends are asking around for a charger because their iPhone 7s are in the red at 6pm my phone is doing all the same stuff as theirs (including using the aux cord hahahah) on 40% with hours left in it.\n\nEDIT: just charged my G5 Plus back to full from about 9% and ended up with [8 hr SoT](https://i.imgur.com/RzkO1Cw.png)",

            "selftext": "So I took a bit of a gamble (considering the few reviews of the device I've seen) and got the Zenfone AR from Verizon to replace an aging Galaxy S7 edge with a multitude of problems. Destroying power cables (knew some folks that had same gen sammy devices doing this), it somehow factory reset itself (still cant figure that one out), and also got the infamous purple line in the right side of the screen along with the battery declining. Quick summary of previous devices, original moto Droid, Droid Bionic, note 1, HTC DNA, iphone 5, xperia z3v, s6 edge, s7 edge. So as you can see I've not tended to any particular manufacturer, I broke my note 1 almost immediately and replaced with the Droid Bionic with a switch back to VZ and the family plan. S6 edge also had a short life...\n\nAnyway, onto my experience with the Zenfone. My rationale for purchasing this was that I've had two Asus laptops, one from 2011 and one from 2012 and both still kicking and working great, windows 7 beasts, unfort. tried to install Win 8 on one of them and severely ruined the experience. But that is irrelevant. My newest 2016 Surface Book is significantly more infuriating to use and has more bugs and crashes or so it seems though its a great concept. Battery life is pretty good. The Zenfone itself presents itself as a large phablet territory phone with a design reminiscent of what a flagship would look like probably a year or a few ago which is exactly what I wanted. Nice, physical home button, and capacitive return and apps keys located on the bottom bezel. Save for tablets I do not like these functions taking up screen real-estate. \n\nThe screen itself when compared to my outgoing sammy s7 edge appeared brighter and slightly cooler, with the samsung showing a much greener (and uglier imo) tinge on everything, especially whites like this background. Now, this could have been bc the samoled screen had aged but it hasnt been used extensively, but maybe average for around a  year and no always on display and wouldnt expect much a decline in display quality. Especially from what is apparently the raved \"best display in the world\" or apparently was at the time. Color reproduction seems very good and blacks are amoled typical jet black and as mentioned, whites seem very bright, if slightly cool colored with a potentially bluish hue. There are options to adjust color temperatures built into the stock settings which is a neat feature.\n\nPerformance and UI: This is another plus for me so far, the moto Droid Bionic, HTC DNA, Xperia z3v, and Sammy phones all have abhorrently thick UI skins and bloatware which bog down the performance of the phone. Admittedly, the latest samsung phones, s7 and newer have been less offensive, but note 1 and earlier were the worst... The Zenfone is VERY toned down with its UI skin. Closest thing to vanilla Android I've ever used which has been my Nexus 10 tab, unfort. no experience with Pixel devices but no interest with no 3.5mm jack... It runs very fast and I've had no lag after downloading my music, movies, and all my apps and cloud backup data. Its also worth noting that the phone comes with a huge 128gb of internal storage which is a big plus in my mind, though only 110 are available for use. Though I believe more can be added as well. I did not like running out of storage on the s6. Yes, this does have the older Snapdragon 821, I don't see it being an issue unless you plan on using AR functions/gaming consistently where the better optimization of the 835 would conserve the battery and prevent the inevitable rapid drain. Regular media consumption, web browsing, general use is no issue.\n\nCamera: Haven't done an extensive test at this time. Initial thoughts and comparison has shown that it is fairly solid, but it can oversaturate colors a bit. Similar problems to many other mobile sensors really. Ex. bright blue water looks turqoise. Details are good, even in low light, with settings optimized, noise can be reduced to levels comparable to other mobile sensors I've used. Color temps can be hit or miss depending on setting and sometimes show up a bit too warm/cold and sometimes nearly perfect which leads me to believe that there is some software kinks and overcompensation that need working out but the sensor itself is fairly good. Overall, not the best, but definitely not the worst. I'm not a photographer so it doesn't drive me up a wall but picture perfect people may want to take note. Have not yet tested front facer. Will update when I do.\n\nAR: Largely gimmicky at this time. Sort of what I expected, not many AR apps available yet, many available to try to sell you stuff (Im guessing these companies corporate sponsored the Tango project?) ex. virtual BMW i8, Wayfair, and roomy... but also some neat stuff like spectra which shows the world in IR (im guessing? thats what it almost looks like, not sure how it works/what sensor its using), dinos among us (self explanatory) and apps that show approximated distances measured in distances relative through the cameras lens, you can map it out and save the photos. There are a handful of others I havent tried yet. Shockingly, or perhaps not so, this is not the reason I bought the phone despite being the main acronym in the title/model.  I do think despite the dismal choices atm, Tango and AR in general has a bright future as google continues to push forward with AR and there will likely be many more AR apps available in the future possible making this feature more relevant/useful.\n\nOverall: Do like: Great and large screen, toned down skin which is close to stock, very little bloatware, runs fast. Decent 3300mah battery, USB-C charging port, 3.5mm jack, rubberized and curved back reminiscent of earlier flagships, you can actually hold it without worrying about a slippery metal and glass iphone clone sliding out of your hand. Single speaker and down facing unfortunately, but loud and has a volume boost button which makes it even louder, probably the loudest single speaker I've heard. Physical home button and capacitive android keys on bottom bezel. Neutral: So-so camera, location of power button/volume rocker combo is a bit awkward but had the phone for about a week so may just be an adjustment curve.\nNegative: Older Snapdragon 821 processor, causes faster battery consumption, largely gimmicky corporate sponsored AR functionality at this point. (Not waterproof/resistant.)\n\nOverall: Would recommend so far. But time will tell if this continues to be the case. Really just wasn't overly impressed with any of the other flagships from Verizon this year, and cannot nor want to lose a headphone jack at this time as I can't afford to convert everything bluetooth right now. It's unique that's for sure. And it's almost never mentioned here after scrolling down threads of recommended devices, or new devices, ect. all I see is \"Samsung this, LG that, Pixel perfect\" and figured I had to give ASUS a little love considering their previous products have been pretty good to me. We'll see if this one holds the trend.",

They often seem to think that including a headphone jack is free from a design standpoint, and manufacturers have no good reason for removing them.\n\nSo let's pose a hypothetical where we take the statement from Essential at face value and ask: If given a choice between two otherwise identical phones, would you rather have a headphone jack or about 10% more battery life?\n\nAssume a mainstream phone form factor along the lines of the Essential, or Pixel, or Galaxy S8, or LG V30, or iPhone. Otherwise, presumably the percentage gains you get on battery life would be different on a much larger or smaller phone. Some of these already have a headphone jack, in that case, you could lose the jack and gain about 10% more battery life. Others don't have one, in which case you could add one and lose 10% battery life.\n\n*Please no copout answers like manufacturers should just hire better engineers that can find a way to get both the 10% and the headphone jack, or manufacturers should just make thick phones that include the kitchen sink. This is a hypothetical. The only choices are better battery life or headphone jack.*",

            "selftext": "Apple recently released three new iPhones and a lot of you might be wanting to switch to iOS. So I decided I wanted to make this thread to tell you guys about my experience on the iOS.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMy first smartphone was an iPhone 4. The phone got really slow and I used to hate iOS back then. When I switched to Android in 2014 with the Nexus 4, Android felt years ahead. After 2 years I upgraded to a Nexus 6P which I truly loved, however after a year I started to have serious battery issues so I bought a Xiaomi Redmi 4 Prime because this phone had a massive 4000 mAh battery, however it lacked in performance and battery. That's when I decided to switch to an iPhone 7, I bought it very cheap brand new a few months ago.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI wanted a phone that just works. I was tired of constantly checking the battery stats to see which app misbehaved, I was tired of flashing ROMs or Kernels to make my device have a batter battery life. I was tired of waiting for updates from Google to fix critical bugs. I was tired of only 2 years support. And when I tested the Oreo update, I was sad to see how bad it looked. Android Lollipop/Marshmallow were the best designed OS ever. It was downhill from there. The new adaptive icons on Oreo are the worst. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhen I started using the iPhone 7 with iOS 10, I realized that iOS has really improved these 5 years. Here is what I liked...\n\n&nbsp;\n\n* **Animations**\n\niPhone 7 with iOS 10 is blazing fast, it never lags. The touch input latency is much lower than my Android phones and there is no delay when interacting with the screen. The animations are extremely smooth and you can interact with them, you can stop animations mid way, you can slide slowly and see how they animate. In Android most of the time you just press something and wait for it to do the animation.\n\n* **Apps are MUCH better on iOS**\n\nEvery app feels like a part of the OS. They are so smooth and so beautiful. Every app has system-like animations. They clearly follow the same design language and Apple makes it easier for apps to look/feel the same. I don't even notice iOS, all apps feel like iOS. It's all about the apps. I am a heavy snapchat user, and the animations and camera quality is miles better. Instagram takes better pictures too. Basically every 3rd party app takes better pictures than Android 3rd party apps. Also iOS is really good at keeping apps open in the background, they rarely reload. Even Google apps are better on iOS. On Android I always had issues with apps disconnecting from chromecast because \"Doze\" is too restrict sometimes.\n\n* **Battery life is stable**\n\niOS allows some adjusting to get the most juice out of your device. But overall the battery is stable. I haven't had an app misbehave. Apps aren't allowed to have their custom notification service running 24/7 like on android. No matter how many apps I install performance and battery life will stay the same unlike Android. Standby time is amazing.\n\n* **3D Touch and Taptic Engine are actually awesome**\n\n3D Touch is very useful and you don't have to learn it or anything, you just use it naturally and it just works. The phone takes LIVE photos which is basically every time you take a photo it takes 3 seconds before/after video with sound. We take photos to be reminded of at a later time what we experienced, and live photos takes it to another level. Taptic Engine makes the phone vibrate depending on what you're doing, when you're pressing the fake button you feel like you're really pressing it, when you swipe down the notifications center you feel it coming down with a vibration. The phone reacts to what you're doing. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nHere is what I didn't like :\n\n&nbsp;\n\n* **Notifications** \nI really really really miss Android notifications. On iOS basically every app sends a single notifications for every single message. There is no grouping/bundling by people or app basis. New message = New Notification. I get a lot of messages so Notification Center gets cluttered within minutes. I keep clicking notifications accidentally when I'm using the top part of the screen, right before I am about to tap something I receive a notification and it opens it. There is also this weird thing on snapchat, on android whenever someone keeps sending messages you get a notification \"NAME (X)\" where the X is the number of paragraphs they sent. On iOS you get a single notification once, and it doesn't matter if they keep typing you don't get any new notifications about that person. Also in Android because of the color, you could see if they sent you a text/photo/video from the notification itself. I got used to it pretty quickly, but I still think Android is miles ahead on the notification part.\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\nOverall, I am extremely happy that I made the switch. I don't have to tinker with my phone anymore(to flash stuff) I don't want to wait for the next system/app update to fix things. I just wanted a phone that is stable and it works, it feels fast, it has a great camera (not just the system app, but 3rd party apps aswell). I don't care about the specs anymore, I just want a great experience. And Apple delivered that experience.\n\n",

Bezel size is reducing. However, S6\nhas achieved that in 2015. Samsung basically hasn\u2019t change the design for 5 iterations. The other android OEM is finally catching up, so is Apple. \n2. Camera is getting much better, especially in low light. \n3. USBC replacing micro-USB. \n4. Water proof.\n4. Iris scanner which is interesting to say the least.\n\n\nAnd that\u2019s it. This is no much else. It\u2019s all incremental improvement. The only real innovation in the last 3 years is basically the curve screen. \n\n\nThe VR rush obviously failed, at least on mobile platform, due to the lack of processing power and heat dispatch. Androidwear is abandoned by Google. The current best non-Apple watch solution runs on Tizen, which is unfortunately still better than Androidwear 2.0.\nGoogle Assistant is getting better, along with mote OEM AI. Hardly any innovation there, unless of course you love Bixby or the next Huawei AI. \n\nAndroid is as stall as ever. Seriously, nothing is new here.\n\nNow let\u2019s go back to look at what Apple did in the last 3 years. They at least keeps on powering wearable market with watch and Airpods. Promoting for depth resolution with double lens which should be standard everywhere very soon. Now they are pushing 3D facial scanner which is a crucial steps in Apple\u2019s grand AR future. And of course removing headphone jack and later Touch ID which is generally ill received.\n\nto;dr: Apple is at least doing something, Android OEM haven\u2019t innovated in any area for a a long time.

Way more hate than what was called for, especially on the Apple side and a select few others. So when I first saw this video (I have it linked down below), I thought \u201cWow! Is fanboyism dead now?\u201d Then I was like, \u201cProbably not. There will always be that group of immature fans on both sides\u201d.\n\nAnyways, it shouldn\u2019t matter which one you think is better since most of this is preferences anyway. Regardless if you\u2019re #TeamApple. #TeamAndroid, #TeamSamsung, #TeamLG, or any combination of those or others. Just pick what you like and do you. No need for an android user to type paragraphs about what their precious android phone can do because 9 times out of 10, everything that was described is useless to that other specific person or they just don\u2019t care about it. No need for an iOS user to type paragraphs about how fast, how clean and so on that their iPhone is because in most cases it doesn\u2019t matter to the other person. But most importantly, no need to assume anything about the other person because all you know about the other person is what phone they prefer.\n\nAnyways, here\u2019s the video. An example of a good comparison while actually being professional.\n[Android vs iOS - What You NEED to Know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQy48VjV53U)",

I saw the post here on /r/android talking about Pixel XLs being given out. I figured I'd give it a go. I replaced mine with hardly any hassle at all. Next up I went to log in to my wife's account and contact support for her. Having already been through this process, I understood exactly what would happen. They would say its out of warranty, BUT WAIT, we can do something for you, AND it's a brand new Pixel XL (they must really be trying to bump up their support rating before the Pixel2?). So I decided to play along with support this time and pretend like I had no idea what would happen. Thanks Google for the fun, but excellent support!\n\n*Transcript*\n\n**Support**\nThanks for contacting Google Support. My name is Support.\nGreetings Wife!\n\n**Wife**\nHi Support!\n\n**Support**\nI've gone through the query you sent me.\n\n**Wife**\nOkay, thank you.\n\n**Support**\nI'm sorry to know you're experiencing issues with the device battery.\nPlease don't worry, let me check what best I can do for you.\nI appreciate your efforts in performing the factory reset.\n\n**Wife**\nOkay thank you. Luckily my husband knows how to do all of that! We had to contact support this morning for his phone!\n\n**Support**\nCool!\nCould you please help me with the IMEI number of the device.\nTo locate IMEI, go to settings >> about phone > status > IMEI information > IMEI\n\n**Wife**\nMy IMEI # is REDACTED\n\n**Support**\nThank you for helping me with the IMEI.\nWas the device purchased from Google store?\n\n**Wife**\nYes it was, on my google account.\nI think I have the order number somewhere if you need it.\n\n**Support**\nAlright, just to confirm, have you followed these steps to perform the factory reset?\nSettings > backup&reset > factory reset.\n\n**Wife**\nYup. We did that twice.\n\n**Support**\nThank you for confirming.\nIs there any accidental damage on the device?\n\n**Wife**\nNo problem.\nNo there is not. I keep a case and a screen protector (glass) on it.\n\n**Support**\nGreat!\nIs the issue started after recent OS update on the device to 7.1.2?\n\n**Wife**\nNo, I don't think so. Its been persistent.\nWe even tried Oreo for a little bit.\n\n**Support**\nAlright, could you please help me with these below details.\n1. Email address associated with the device.\n2. Current shipping address.\n\n**Wife**\nSure. I purchased the device on my account which is REDACTED\n\nMy shipping address is: REDACTED\n\n**Support**\nThank you!\n\n**Wife**\nNo problem!\n\n**Support**\nThank you for providing all the required information.\nAs the issue still persists, I've checked the warranty options and noticed that the device passed its warranty period on Dec 25, 2016.\n\n**Wife**\nOh no.\n\n**Support**\nPlease don't worry, I'm trying all my available options and working beyond my limitations to check if I can process an exception replacement for you.\nCould you please allow me two minutes while I work on this for you.\n\n**Wife**\nOkay, of course. Thank you.\n\n**Support**\nThank you!\nMeanwhile, how was your day so far?\n\n**Wife**\nNot too bad! I was late to work due to a car accident (not my own) so that was a bummer, but otherwise it has been okay so far.\nThanks for asking! How about you?\n\n**Support**\nI'm sorry to know that!\nI hope you recover soon!\nI've started my day chatting with you and I believe it will be an amazing day for me.\nThank you for asking.\n\n**Wife**\nAnytime.\n\n**Support**\nI've worked on this for you beyond my limitations.\nI'm glad to inform you that I've processed a one time exception replacement for you.\n\n**Wife**\nOMG! Thank you so much!\nWhat do I have to do now?\n\n**Support**\nI'll explain this for you, before that, I've some fantastic news to share with you. Guess what?\n\n**Wife**\nOh man, even more news? What?!\n\n**Support**\nThe replacement device we're sending you is a brand new Pixel XL.\n\n**Wife**\nOMG! Really? That is great news! I've heard good things about that phone!\n\n**Support**\nI've sent you a confirmation email with the shipping labels to return the defective device and link to place the order for the replacement device.\nCould you please check and confirm, if you've received email from me.\n\n**Wife**\nOkay, one second.\n\n**Support**\nSure!\n\n**Wife**\nYup, I have the email!\n\n**Support**\nPerfect!\nI hope I was able to help you with this issue today and make it a wonderful day for you!\n\n**Wife**\nYou definitely helped and it is definitely a wonderful day!

Which leaves me to this question, where does Android fit?\n\nThe problem I see rising in the future is that OEMs will no longer need to use Android at all. Since Windows will be competing in this market via bring PC to Mobile, so Mobile PCs will be considered your PC and your phone and tablet. So Google will no longer have that advantage they enjoyed with candy bar phones. \n\nAlso Android is a highly toxic market for OEMs to compete in, Windows is not, it's quite diverse, Microsoft is essentially bringing that diversity of PC to Mobile, along with the potential of Intel, AMD and also discrete GPUs running Windows 10. \nI fear we may see the repeat of the Android tablet market. Android tablets weren't profitable, MS came in showed OEMs how to do it. Everybody moved to Windows 10 and Android tablets basically rotted.

            "selftext": "Besides the LG Nexus phones, I haven\u2019t used a true LG flavored Android phone so I wanted to give the LG G6 a try. I was originally looking into the Oneplus 5, but after seeing what it offered at it\u2019s price point, I opted to look else where for a Nexus 6P replacement. \n\n**Design**: The LG G6 looks and feels amazing. From the near bezel-less screen on the front, to the metal sides, to the glass back that has a slight curve on the edges that make it look like it\u2019s spilling over.The top of the phone has a 3.5 mm headphone back, volume buttons on the left, sim and MicroSD tray on the right and USB-C port and single speaker along the bottom. The front of the phone showcases it\u2019s beautiful 5.7\u201d 2880 x 1440, a barely noticeable LG logo at the bottom and the earpiece, sensors and front-facing camera on the top. The back has the fingerprint sensor/power button combo and dual cameras. The only thing I wish the phone had was front-facing speakers and an AMOLED screen. The speakers would\u2019ve been great for media consumption and the AMOLED would\u2019ve been great when watching Youtube as there will be black bars on the sides as the video won\u2019t fit the aspect ratio.\n\n**Hardware**: The phone is quick. What more do I have to say. While it has the Snapdragon 821 while every other flagship shipped this year has the 835, it is still more than enough to do what I need to do. My general days are media consumption via Youtube, Google Play Music, Netflix and Reddit Sync. I don\u2019t play many games and if I do, it\u2019s to try it for a bit. The fingerprint scanner is quick and I have no issue unlocking my phone. I have had some minor issues in my previous car where I was using an AUX to FM Transmitter where it would trigger Google Assistance, volume changes and random pausing. It doesn\u2019t happen every time as it will go away after adjusting the connection a bit, but can be annoying at times. Now that I use Android Auto, not a big deal, but thought I should mention it.\n\n**Software**: After coming from a series of Nexus phones, I was expecting something garish, but everything was fairly minimal. The overall theme is dark with white accents. I rarely stepped into LGs apps as I had a replacement for the stock offerings that I preferred. The camera app was full of features which was the total opposite of the Camera app on my Nexus 6P which was fairly barebones. Double-tap to wake is nice to see notifications or access my music player controls when the phone was resting on my table. The only thing I really missed from my Nexus was the phone app looking up unknown numbers when I was receiving the call to see if it was okay to deny it or not and also not having bloat. It was kinda annoying setting up the phone and seeing that apps like Facebook and Evernote were already there. I could disable them, but would've preferred not having them there to begin with.\n\n**Battery and Charging**: The battery is decent. I get about 5 hours of screen on time. It\u2019s not amazing like the Moto Z Play which I had used before, but it isn\u2019t horrible. I don\u2019t do anything anything intensive and my day to day is mostly reddit, emails and text messages. The phone charges very quick at home and charging while using Android Auto when commuting, I rarely have to worry about running out in the middle of the day.\n\n**Speaker**: A single downward facing speaker pales in comparison to the dual front facing speakers of other phones like the Nexus 6P, but it\u2019s nice and loud. \n\n**Camera**: I think the camera looks great. I think that at this point, flagship cameras take great photos and the only thing people would care about is if it\u2019s warmer or cooler for their tastes. It won\u2019t replace your DSLR, but for posting on Facebook, Instagram or showing off to your friends, it's fine. The wide angle lens has been great when I go outdoors to snap a great landscape or.\n\n**Overall**: The phone is great (despite the annoying headphone jack issues at times). It doesn\u2019t have the latest technology like the Snapdragon 835, but it is perfectly fine without it. I have not noticed any poor performance when using it day to day and it does everything I need it to. There are some things I wish it had like an AMOLED display or front facing speakers, but I love the aspect ratio of the display and how it just doesn\u2019t feel real when I hold it with the minimal bezels around it. \n\nAfter seeing the offerings of Samsung, HTC, Apple, etc. the LG G6 is a strong contender. It may not have the best camera, fastest CPU or most pure Android, it is still a solid performer that should warrant consideration.\n\n\n",

            "selftext": "We all know the Google Pixel is a fantastic phone and takes some outstanding photos. Even to this day, many people here constantly say the Pixel has the best low light camera in any phone. But why? I hope to help make the \u201cwhy\u201d more clear with this post. This is clearly a low light explaination, and all my comments are about noise and low light performance. Cameras obviously go much deeper, but to keep things simple its only about noise and low light. \n\n**Intro**\n\nFirst we need to understand the camera. The camera is listed as a 12.3 MP, f/2.0, 1/2.3\" sensor size, 1.55\u00b5m pixel size. Lets break this down. \n\n* 12.3 MP \n\nMegapixel is how many pixels the sensor has and is capable of capturing. Typically lower pixel counts allow for more light to hit each pixel. \n\n* F/2.0\n\nThis is the F stop of the lense, lower numbers such as F/1.8 allow more light. Most cameras use a 1/3 stop scale, so each increment is 1/3\u2019d less light as the number increases: 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.4, 1.6, 1.8, 2.0, 202, 2.5, 2.8\n\nIn short, this means that the F/1.6 found in the LG V30 allows 66% more light to the sensor. \n\n* 1/2.3\" sensor size, 1.55\u00b5m pixel size\n\nThis is the sensor size, much like F stop, larger sensors let in more light. Smaller sensors let in less light. Sensor size does vary from phone to phone, but not much. \n\n**Noise**\n\nAll camera sensors create tons of noise in low light, even the best sensors today. You typically don\u2019t see this noise because almost every photo will be saved with some level of noise reduction applied by the software. Noise is in every photo but is more prominent in low light due to the camera sensor increasing the ISO, basically the sensitivity of the image sensor to capture more light. The lower the light, the more noise. \n\n[Here is an example of a RAW noisy photo with absolutely no noise reduction]( https://i.imgur.com/C8JzMdp.jpg) and here is an [even closer look at the same photo]( https://i.imgur.com/MNsD6u9.jpg) see the noise? It generally makes the photo look rather crappy and noise is more prominent in lower light conditions as the sensor struggles to capture more light. \n\n**Why is the Pixel better?**\n\nAll smartphone cameras have noise in their RAW files. Cameras with brighter lenses will have less noise due to the lens allowing more light to hit the sensor. So if the S8 and the V30 have brighter lenses than the Pixel, why is the Pixel still so much better? \n\n**Handling Noise** \n\nThe answer is simple, Google simply handles this noise better than all the other manufacturers. Lets look at some of the ways the Pixel controls noise, with the last 2 being unique to the Pixel. \n\n**Luminance and Color Noise Reduction**\n\nThis is the most common technique. Software reduces luminance noise by averaging the pixel values and smoothing the whole picture. This reduces the roughness of the image but at the same time it results in an overall loss of sharpness. \n\n[Here is the last image we looked at with this noise reduction applied]( https://i.imgur.com/TAiVvZH.jpg) and a [closer look]( https://i.imgur.com/35DJj4s.jpg). As you can see, the noise is reduced but we lost the fine detail in the image. \n\n**Multi-frame Noise Reduction/HDR+**\n\nIt\u2019s said that HDR+ has the best low light performance on the Pixel, and there is good reason. HDR+ stands for \"High-Dynamic Range + Low Noise\". It achieves this low noise through whats called Multi-frame Noise Reduction.\n\nThe real challenge for any kind of noise reduction is separating the signal from the noise. Since noise is random and changes with every shot, it makes sense that if you made multiple exposures of a scene and all of the actual image-forming detail remained the same from frame to frame, and the noisy pixels would be different in every frame, you could analyze the exposures as a group to better determine which pixels comprise image-forming detail and which ones are just noise. \n\n[Here is an example of a photo take with multi-frame noise reduction and luminance noise reduction applied]( https://i.imgur.com/JdKu0AR.jpg), and [a closer look]( https://i.imgur.com/cAkJP01.jpg). Notice the fine detailed are preserved better? This is because the noise algorithm has more data to work with. \n\nNote: the photo is different because they were taken at different times, I was forced to use an exposure of 5 photos combined in software so emulate this technology.\n\n\n**Deep learning and advanced noise reduction**\n\nThe last step to noise reduction is the last reason the Pixel takes outstanding photos, because google does more than just process noise in traditional ways, Google has a powerful algorithm that analyzes each and every pixel. This technology searches for similarities among pixels, whose values are then averaged. Unlike Luminance, this technology only applies to the noise rather than the whole picture, which in turn preserves detail.\n \nI do not have access to Googles algorithem, but I do have access to DXO Optics Pro 10 which offers a similar technique. [Here is the result](https://i.imgur.com/Ki5GOOS.jpg) and a [closer look](https://i.imgur.com/gZE4Szc.jpg). \n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThis is what Google does that other phones do not do. Google has built in the best and smartest noise reduction out there, and its all based on a complex algorithm that no other manufacturer has. Combining this advanced noise reduction with HDR+ gives the software significantly more data and processing ability, resulting in a better photo than even cameras with better specs. \n\n\nEdit: Spelling errors and clarifications \n",

            "selftext": "So I have had a Lenovo P2 for a while now and it's great, it's got a big battery, beautiful screen, good price (and terrible camera). For my use it's a good phone.\nI consider myself an enthusiast and I researched the phone thoroughly before buying it; still, after countless reviews and videos explaining every detail about the device I recently bumped into a \"feature\" i didn't expect to affect the user: Widevine DRM. \nApparently my phone falls in the L3 level of security thus while using Netflix I can't take advantage of my 1080p display because the app only outputs SD video.\nNow this doesn't affect me much\u200b because I mainly consume video through my iPad but many people only use their phone and if I were one of them I'd be pretty bummed about this.\nSo what I'm asking here is for r/android to solve this problem by making the level of DRM a phone has a part of the discussion;  I paid \u20ac200 for my phone and you could argue I should expect my device to have these kind of quirks, but if I had bought a \u20ac600 OnePlus 5 (which also has the same problem) I'd be furious.\n\ntl;dr: DRM sucks and hurts paying costumers. In the future if you recommend  a phone on r/android that might have this same problem please acknowledge it in your suggestion.\nYou can check your level of DRM with the app https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.androidfung.drminfo\n",

Last week I randomly glanced at my Google Drive Backup folder, and the Android backup for my 6P was missing. After freaking out a little, [I found this.](https://support.google.com/drive/answer/6305834?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en) Contacting Drive support confirms that there's no recovery.\n\nThere was no warning from Google. They just deleted my data. There's apparently an expiration date that shows up under the backup if I had checked the Backup folder sooner, but there was no notification, no email, no proactive notice at all, and most importantly, *no option to use the 100gb of my Drive storage to keep my fucking backup.*\n\nSwitching between Android installs is already a pain in the ass. You have to manually save your SMS's if you want to keep them, many apps still don't use Android backup and their settings wipe every time...but the apps that *do* back up are restored painlessly, which is always a relief during the process. Unless Google themselves deletes your backup first. Along with the dozens of wifi passwords I had stored, which is probably the worst part for me.\n\nSo now I'm back to square one.

            "selftext": "I've thought a lot about the buying habits of all consumers when it comes to technology but in particular Smartphones. I have a few key points I'd like to outline that I think are wildly overlooked: \n\nA lot of people buy smartphones to show their status in society, in other words, to show that they are wealthy enough to afford an expensive device - however it isn't always spoken about because I think it is an involuntary thought process that people make. It's involuntary because this particular group of buyers are constantly associating an iPhone with a wealthier demographic and they will strive to be a part of that. \n\nHowever, there are undeniably a large number of people who simply buy an iPhone because of its brand recognition and the fact that it is expensive and everyone around them knows that it's expensive. Absolutely no different from buying a backpack from Louis Vuitton or Gucci just because they are perceived as a wealthy persons accessory. To put my opinion in terms of a percentage, **I can estimate that as large as 60% of the general population fall into this category of involuntarily or voluntarily buying a phone because of its brand recognition and social status symbol**\n\n\nObviously features such as camera, battery life and display undeniably are major reasons to buy a phone, but look at the Pixel Vs S8+ Vs LG V30: The difference between the feature sets are minimal from a broad perspective, the reason the population go and buy a Samsung Galaxy S8 is simply because it is the most expensive, most brand recognised out of the 3 options available, so that gives them an involuntary perception that Samsung flagships are the best! \n\nThe people in this subreddit will overwhelmingly downvote this post simply because we are a niche group and we appreciate the technicals and specs of a phone moreso than the general public. I can say this because I experience on a daily basis the complete lack of understanding about technical specifications when it comes to smartphones and the general non-reddit public. \n\nWhat does everyone think? \n\nTLDR; The majority of consumers by from Apple and Samsung because of brand recognition and to also show their status in society. \n\n",

Other interesting devices have come along, but they were all lacking something - most of the time it was wireless charging. But, *how can you stand using a phone with such abysmal battery life*, I hear you ask. It's easy: I forget about it. I forget about charging, I forget about stamina, I forget about plugging it in. I just put my phone on my wireless charging pads at home and work when it's convenient, and don't even think about the topic that most wired people with much better devices still seem to be obsessing over.\n\n**THAT** is the benefit of wireless charging. It's an additional convenience that might completely change the way you handle your phone. No, it doesn't work for everyone, but it doesn't take anything away from anyone either. The thought of having a wide range of models to upgrade to that have significantly better battery life to completely forget about makes me excited.",

I also happen to read alot of books, comics, and manga on my phone, and the 2:1 aspect ratio really shows how space is wasted with huge black bars on the top and bottom, paired with only being able to see half a page and having to scroll sideways when having the comics stretch to fit the new height. When using my s8 plus I feel like I'm reading on a Honor 8s 5.2\" 16:9 display because of the narrowness. \n\n I know that eventually content will shift over to the different aspect ratio but I also feel that there are certain things like comics and manga that wont be able to adapt as easily.\n\nWord vomit aside is anyone else feeling like 2:1 aspect ratios are ideal for smaller sized phones but aren't necessarily beneficial to larger devices?",

While it still has all of the things you would expect from an iPhone 7 successor, it also lacks many of the fancy new features the iPhone X has, from the OLED screen, the face scanning sensor array and the related Animoji. The non-X models also have larger bezels, which people around here really hate. Does this re-contextualize the Essential Phone for you, or the Pixel 2, or even midrange flagships like the OnePlus 5?\n\nIt's also important to note, as the iPhone 7 launched at a base price of $650, this would be a $50 price increase over last year's model.",

They won't go backwards, as that will be admitting they made a mistake. As impressive as Face ID is, it leaves me feeling uncomfortable. I like fingerprint readers, and particularly like them on the front as home buttons like on the iPhone 7 and Galaxy S7 (the placement on the S8 is horrendous). If Samsung (or any other OEM) can embed the fingerprint reader under a virtual home button they'll have made my (and many others) ideal unlocking mechanism. \n\nEdit: It looks like some people think I am saying apple cannot have both touch ID and Face ID on the same device; they most certainly can but what I'm trying to say is that they won't (not cannot). If they do re-add Touch ID in the future, what does that say of Face iD? \nTo me, it says that FaceID was not the complete replacement for TouchID that it is currently claimed to be on the iPhone X. At a basic level, they both serve the same purpose; provide a mechanism for authentication. FaceID is not simply complementing TouchID, it replaces it entirely. How would Apple spin the return of TouchID? For them to re-add it to a future phone is to either say FaceID was not the complete replacement they thought it would be or that Touch ID has some benefits that they had originally considered not important enough to keep for the iPhone X. \n\nThis is not to say that FaceID is not amazing; it is. It opens up possibilities that Touch ID alone cannot offer. But I am surprised that Apple opted to remove TouchID entirely from the iPhone X.",

I'd get the newer one to have NFC if it wasn't so sporty looking.\n\nI get that with Apple, you've got one manufacturer controlling the entire product from concept to shipping, but surely a company with as much cash on hand as Google could come out with the Pixel Watch and it just be thin, light, have a good battery and NFC and waterproofing and CHR and we'd be done.\n\nOn the flip side, if Apple would integrate the watch with Android already (or at least give developers the ability to throw notifications over to it in a basic fashion), they'd have my cash right now.\n\nAnyone else in the same boat?",

Pre-order for Rs. 67,900 ($1061). Free wireless charger when pre-ordering. Available colors are Maple Gold and Midnight Black. Shipping starts on September 21. There is Rs.4000 cashback on payment through HDFC credit cards. Also, there is a Note upgrade program wherein Note2, 3, 4 and 5 users can avail discounts through buybacks. This can be done using the 'My Galaxy' app. \n\nI am upgrading from Note 2 which I can sell for Rs. 2600. So, along with the HDFC credit card cashback, it is effectively costing me Rs. 61,300 ($957). It is not as overpriced as I had predicted IMO since Galaxy S8 is available for Rs. 57,900 ($900) and S8+ for Rs. 64,900 ($1015).",

            "selftext": "For people like me, who like to use their phone a lot for everything (work, communication, news, etc.), having a phone with long battery life is crucial for people who don\u2019t have access to a charger throughout the day. Sadly, more phone makers are making thinner phones instead of adding bigger batteries, leading to many dead smartphones. Fortunately, Zerolemon is there to save the day. I am reviewing the Samsung Galaxy S8+ Zerolemon 8,500 mAh Extended Battery Case. Product link: https://www.zerolemon.com/product/samsung-galaxy-s8-plus-8500mah-battery-case/This case works ONLY for the Galaxy S8+, NOT the S8 (although Zerolemon does make a case for the S8). It not only offers additional protection, but it will also give your phone over 2 full charges (and then some) off of the case\u2019s external battery. This more than doubles your phone\u2019s battery life, allowing lighter users to go 3+ days without needing a charge, and heavy users to go over 2.5 full days with the phone surviving everything you throw at it (music, texting, navigation, YouTube, full brightness, productivity apps, gaming, etc.) This case charged my Galaxy S8+ from 20% to full in about 45 minutes, so it offers fast charging speeds in addition to extra battery life. The case has a button on the back that charges the phone. When you want to stop charging the phone, you press the button and it stops the charging. It also has 4 LED lights to indicate the charge level of the case. To charge the case, simply leave it plugged into the phone and plug a cable into the case. It directs the power to the phone first, then once the phone is charged the case itself starts charging. The only slight downside is that the case uses a MicroUSB input to charge, rather than USB-Type C which the S8+ uses by default. The good news is, good MicroUSB cables are more common than USB-C and also inexpensive. Be forewarned, this turns your phone into an absolute BRICK due to all the extra battery it provides. However, I have grown quite accustomed to it and now I feel weird if I hold a phone that DOESN\u2019T have a battery case on it. For most people (including myself), the benefit of extra-long battery life far outweighs the added bulk and helps me get through the day without having to worry about ",

The shield tablet k1, which sold for only $200 is not going for $500 used on Amazon. Dell and HP are completely out of the market, Lenovo sells a few tablets, mostly on lollipop or marshmallow. Asus, once the biggest name it Android tablets is still selling a tablet with 4.2 Jelly bean.\n\nSamsung is still an option, but their software and design is a turn off for many and their specs on cheaper models is terrible. Pixel C is very expensive as well. Nexus 7s are selling at a premium used as well despite being 4 years old.\n\nI know tablets are out of favor with many, but for kids or people without a phablet phone, they are still a very useful device.

            "selftext": "I'm writing this in hopes that it reaches the top of Google searches for \"crappy Android Bluetooth audio quality.\"\n\nSo I've owned, for various periods of time, every Galaxy flagship that Samsung has released. They've made some incredible innovations during that time: best AMOLED screen on any device, (arguably) the best camera on any smartphone today, fastest custom SoC on the market (Exynos), ahead of the curve in cellular radio technology (if I recall correctly, Samsung made the first widely-available LTE and VoLTE phones in the United States and were the first to implement RCS wide-scale), etc. Galaxy devices have never disappointed from a hardware standpoint; using a Galaxy device felt like using the future.\n\nI've never been able to say the same about their Bluetooth audio stack.\n\nI've owned Bluetooth headphones exclusively for almost three years now. Listening to music over Bluetooth on iPhones or Nexus devices has largely been a great experience. To me non-audiophile ears, the quality was always on par with wired headphones. That has *never* been the case with Samsung phones. It's hard to describe over text, but music  over Bluetooth has always sounded compressed and lacking in crispness. The sharpness of crashes or harsh high-hat strikes (and even some vocals) turns into a pixellated blur. This effect worsens significantly when using another Bluetooth peripheral at the same time, usually a Low-Energy one like a wearable. The only way to remedy this is to disable Bluetooth on the wearable, effectively making it useless for notifications, calls and the like.\n\nI've experienced this on low- and high-quality headphones as well as in car receivers. It really puts a wet blanket on the audio experience.\n\nI've always done some digging on this when the bit crush gets annoying, and it has always come back to this:\n\n**Samsung needs to support AAC.**\n\nHere's the thing. As of, I believe, the S6, Samsung phones have supported the AptX codec. Like AAC, AptX is meant to provide a high-bitrate compression algorithm that is battery friendly without sacrificing audio quality. This is great and all, except for one issue: **hardly any auto head units, headphones, home receivers or other Bluetooth audio peripherals support it.** Why? Like AAC, it is *not* free, but unlike AAC, it is not supported by Apple devices. They have no reason to support it either, as AAC has been, and continues to be, every bit as capable of high-bitrate, high-quality Bluetooth audio streaming as AptX.\n\nHere's the even weirder part: **AOSP has supported AAC with A2DP since Jelly Bean!** I confirmed this years ago when I had the S4 by installing Cyanogenmod on it. CM was inconvenient as hell, but music over Bluetooth sounded gorgeous. Why Samsung chooses to exclude it in all of their images is beyond me.\n\nBecause of this, your Galaxy phones will use SBC on just about everything. SBC has a maximum bandwidth of 384 Kbits/sec. Additionally, and this is just a guess, it seems that Samsung's Bluetooth stack will intentionally restrict streaming bandwidth even further when a LE device is connected in favour of better battery life. When this happens, bit crushed highs become all but absent and vocals get incredibly muddy. Listening to nearly anything becomes nigh unacceptable.\n\nBuying an adapter to address this is unacceptable for such expensive devices. Restricting your choices in Bluetooth headphones and other peripherals is unacceptable for such expensive devices. **AAC should be supported out of the box.**\n\nTL;DR: Listening to Bluetooth music on Galaxy devices sucks unless you have rare equipment that supports AptX. Samsung supporting AAC will completely fix this.",

            "selftext": "There's been a lot of conversation about the Moto X4 since the leak of it's entry to the Android One program, possibly in the US (with project Fi support)\n\nSo I wanted to make a few comments to open some discussion - The Moto X4 is the true mid ranger we've been missing. If the Moto G is the Corolla, the X4 is the Camry. It's not budget, but it's not expensive either - the sleek glass build and superior camera separates it.\n We're seeing the high end smartphones start closer to $800-1000, and a phone in the $350-500 range fills the gap. The OnePlus 5 may be $479, but OnePlus's inconsistency and lack of distribution makes it somewhat of a moot point. \n\nIf the Moto X4 can spark some extra competition from the likes of LG and Samsung in the Android One program (especially in the US) it'll be a game changer for phone price tiers. Thoughts?\n\nEDIT: September 11th,     \nhttp://nymag.com/selectall/2017/09/the-usd1-000-iphone-x-is-just-the-beginning.html    \nAn Article says exactly what I'm calling for, more competition in the midrange - we need more Civics!\n",

I decided to test a little experiment out, and would appreciate if others could chime in.\n\nI turned on Google Now and the works (location reporting and history were both turned on). Having the phone connected on wifi, and stationary, resulted in a drain of as low as 0.4% over 7 hours (this happened while I was sleeping). I used Better Battery Stats to see if any wakelocks were inducing the drain, and to read the average % drain as well.\n\nI then left my home (I left wifi enabled, even though it wasn't connected, but have the option to alert me of any open networks turned off), with location reporting enabled, and in a span of a bit over 2 hours, the drain was around 4.5% per hour.\n\nRight now, I've turned off Location Reporting and disabled wifi, and left the phone stationary to see what the drain is with Google Now and 4G (edit: I had Google Now turned off as well, and the train was 2.6% with mediocre 4G coverage and random Whatsapp messages coming in the background - and one nlp wakelock of 13 seconds in 1h30m and 600kb of miscellaneous data transferred in the background, some Google, some Whatsapp, some something else).\n\nMy question is - what is the average drain you get with Google Now (and location reporting) fully enabled? Which bring me to my  next two questions:\n- how many of you have location reporting disabled, but have Google Now enabled?\n- how many of you have location reporting AND Google Now both disabled?\n\nI've left it off for more than a few years now because of the background drain - I even turned off location reporting off for this reason. But my reason for starting this experiment was because in the Oreo documentation, they say that their wakelock banishing mechanisms work on all apps, including Play Services - but I got around 5 minutes of nlpwakelockcollector wakelocks and 3 minutes of the other nlp wakelock - in 2 hours - otherwise it would never be this high!",

I had stopped using google assistant altogether because it become more personable but less practical...\n\nEven notifications, while having less \"features\" are way simpler to deal with on Marshmallow.\n\nI honestly never would have thought going back to 2015 would yield a better experience than 2017 on a Nexus phone.

            "selftext": "One of the most annoying things about Android is how QWERTY phones have basically phased out in favor of touch keyboards or new ways to type like swype or minum keyboard (or even voice). Many people welcome this, however I'm one of the few that does not.\n\nI had a HTC Desire Z and a Motorola Droid. Those 2 phones were fantastic and had built in keyboards. ~~Before that I had an XDA Mini S running Windows Mobile, which also had a built in keyboard.~~\n\n~~(then when I gave iphones a try I kind of forgot all about keyboards but lets not talk about that here)~~\n\nUp until the middle of 2016 I was basically managing with the touch keyboard but then I got so mad with it that I just gave up and stopped enjoying using my Android devices. I do a lot of work on SSH terminals and remote servers. For those that don't know what that is, basically typing a lot of things which need to be precise.\n\n* I like to use my phone in landscape, and when a keyboard is up there's almost no screen left to see what I'm doing. [Who's idea was it to decide that this is the most efficient way to use our beastly phones these days?](http://i.imgur.com/pM5Peaa.jpg)\n* I honestly prefer tactile feedback, also when playing games. I'm not able to enjoy a game which has a joystick and buttons on the screen.\n* The other annoyance that every time I touch the screen I block what I'm seeing/typing out.\n\nEnough complains, here's what I did about it. I picked up a Motorola Photon Q which lasted me just under 1 year. Downgrading from a Galaxy Note 3 I noticed a HUGE slowdown in the performance and speed that I was used to. So much so that I got angry many times while the device lagged, or got it's internal storage filled up by just 5 apps. Other than that the device was a real pleasure to use and the keyboard is great. However the sim slot died on me (it was sim modded from ebay), so now I had to decide what I wanted to do about it.\n\nLong story short, I made my own hardware hacked QWERTY phone: [here's a gallery](http://imgur.com/a/1hNjF).\n\nFor those that hate or don't see any benefit to a physical keyboard then you will probably think this looks ugly or useless, too thick, or whatever else. I have to agree that it's not hugely aesthetically pleasing in some parts, but it's got functionality that's 10/10. Here's some more info:\n\n* Combined weight is 233g. This is 166g for the phone.\n* The keyboard is one of 4 different bluetooth keyboards I invested in for iPhones (sorry for mentioning that swear word here but it's 100% relevant). It has all the keys that I need (tab, alt, ctrl, etc.) that don't appear on many other micro keyboards.\n* The mod is very simple: chop off the plastic on the top half of the keyboard case and trim it right down to the runners, then attach the phone back to the trimmed plastic. It's done.\n* The only \"damage\" done to the phone is to it's back cover, which is a $5 replacement on eBay.\n* Because of how easy it is to attach (strong thin sticky tape that's double sided) it's very durable and strong. This also means that a new phone's back cover can also be attached (providing it's flat and removable).\n* The camera does not work while the keyboard is closed, it ALMOST does but there's not enough space there and a black area is visible in the lens view. I could probably grind down the plastic that sticks out to fix this.\n* [The weight of the device makes it not possible to sit flat while open](http://i.imgur.com/it8lkeZ.jpg), which is a bit of a shame but not a problem, because....\n* [This is the best bit about the mod](http://i.imgur.com/RGaB0Qx.jpg), it acts as a stand for landscape viewing. This is really the perfect SSH terminal for my needs as I can just sit it on a table and leave a long running process and keep glancing at it, or keep a dashboard script running to monitor my things.\n* Continuing the above, turning off the keyboard and using it as just an angled stand means you can connect a slightly larger keyboard and you've got yourself a mini laptop that's ultra portable. (Throw linux on it via chroot and it's literally a laptop in your pocket, which is my plan!)\n* You might be thinking that it's a pain to keep it turned on and off, charging multiple things, needing more batteries, etc. Luckily, this keyboard has a very nice design choice. When it's closed a magnet signals it to disable bluetooth and turn the device off completely to save power (that's the keyboard itself, not the phone). It instantly auto connects after sliding open. This saves so much battery life and eliminates the need to manually turn on or off the keyboard or to remember to connect it etc.\n* The slide mechanism and angle mechanism is very sturdy. [You can see white pads in this image](http://i.imgur.com/aefsf8D.jpg) which I added to keep the whole mechanism under constant pressure, which stops any kind of rattling or wobbling about.\n\nThat's probably enough info, can't think of anything else more important to mention. Just thought that some people out there if they are fans of QWERTY phones might find this interesting, and maybe want to do a similar mod.",

            "selftext": "There has been a lot of talk about the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL (RIP\nheadphone jack) and this has got me thinking: why did Google \nbuild the Pixel? I mean, the Nexus program was (as far as I \nunderstand) sort of a guide for OEMs, like Google telling them\n\"Here's what a 20XX phone should look like, with features XYZ,\" and of course as a way to fix the ever-present update issues \u2014 or show how it could be done, perhaps. The Pixel, however, served no such purpose, the Nexuses (Nexi?) 5X and 6P were already on the market and, aside from the bootlooping and battery issues, were generally well-received at that time. So I guess my question is: What is Google's aim in building the Pixel? Especially considering that  [Google sold Motorola to Lenovo](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2014/01/nuclear-stand-down-google-samsung-and-the-sale-of-motorola-mobility/) to disperse any OEM fears that it was going to structure itself vertically (kinda like Apple) and start favoring its own products, or even cut the OEMs off entirely. Also, what was the general reaction of the OEMs, especially Samsung, as it was in some sort of a \"Cold War\" (by Arstechnica's terms) with Google \u2014 Samsung being Google's biggest Android shipper, and Google increasing control over Android, possibly one day pulling the rug from under their feet. \n\n\nNote: This is not an attack on Google or its Pixel devices, or Samsung and its Galaxy devices, I think both are great in their own respective manners.

            "selftext": "I got this idea from another post, as many people don't fully understand and/or appreciate the way that Google updates phones. And for good reason, they're not as \"simple\" as Apple. Before the table, some key notes:\n\n* I'm including the HTC Dream/G1, which as the first Android phone, sold also as a developer phone and running stock Android, was essentially the first \"Nexus\" device. If you disagree, just ignore that line in the table :)\n* One could argue that the Motorola Droid, launching with Android 2.0, was a \"Google\" phone. But it was superseded by the Nexus One in 2-3 months, and then Verizon messed up the software, so I excluded it. It did not receive updates directly from Google like the other phones on this list (or from Google, through the carrier, as we traditionally see).\n* I'm including what we think we know about the Pixel 2 lineup.\n* There is a clear divide between the Galaxy Nexus, and the Nexus 4. The Nexus One through Galaxy Nexus fell under Google's \"18-month\" rule. But the Nexus 4 saw ongoing support that confused people, until [GOOGLE MADE IT OFFICIAL (clickable link)] (https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/4457705?hl=en#nexus_devices). And as you'll see below, some devices gained software support even beyond those official windows.\n* Android 8.0 Oreo is used as \"current\" for current devices, as factory images are available and the rollout is confirmed as \"soon.\"\n* September 2017 security patches are listed as current, but Oreo devices will supposedly get those with the Oreo update. As such, some Nougat devices may beat the current Nexus/Pixel devices to this security patch.\n\nAnd now, on to the table:\n\nModel|Manufacturer|Release Date|Software|Security|Play Services\n:--|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|\nDream/G1|HTC|09/2008|1.6 \"Donut,\" 10/2009 (13 months)|N/A (predates security patch levels)|N/A (predates Google Play Services)\nNexus One|HTC|01/2010|2.3.6 \"Gingerbread,\" 09/2011 (20 months)|N/A (predates security patch levels)|10.x.x (02/2017)\nNexus S|Samsung|12/2010|4.1.2 \"Jelly Bean,\" 10/2012 (22 months)|N/A (predates security patch levels)|**Current (11.5.09)**\nGalaxy Nexus|Samsung|11/2011|4.3 \"Jelly Bean,\" 07/2013 (18 months|N/A (predates security patch levels)|**Current (11.5.09)**\nNexus 4|LG|11/2012|5.1.1 \"Lollipop,\" 05/2015 (30 months)|10/01/2015|**Current (11.5.09)**\nNexus 5|LG|10/2013|6.0.1 \"Marshmallow,\" 12/2015 (26 months)|12/05/2016|**Current (11.5.09)**\nNexus 6|Motorola|11/2014|7.1.1 \"Nougat,\" 01/2017 (26 months)|**Current (09/05/2017)**|**Current (11.5.09)**\nNexus 5x/6p|LG/Huawei|09/2015|**(Current) 8.0 \"Oreo\"**|**Current (09/05/2017)**|**Current (11.5.09)**\nPixel/XL|HTC|10/2016|**(Current) 8.0 \"Oreo\"**|**Current (09/05/2017)**|**Current (11.5.09)**\nPixel 2/XL|HTC/LG|10/2017|**(Current) 8.0 \"Oreo\"**|**Current (09/05/2017)**|**Current (11.5.09)**\n\nNow, let me explain. Apple does all of their updates uniformly. EVERYTHING is in the firmware, even the latest version of their bundled apps. Android users get a new build of Chrome via the Play Store every ~6 weeks, while iPhone users get a new version of Safari when Apple includes it in a firmware update. Additionally, Google breaks out their updates between firmware/OS, security level patches, and Google Play Services (GPS). The primary purpose of GPS is to allow for app developers to target the latest API level (26 in \"Oreo\"), while maintaining compatibility with older handsets and features, something Apple does not do. If you want to support an older iPhone that isn't getting updates, you need to do it manually.\n\nAnd not to paint too rosy a picture, but Google might have the right idea in stopping firmware/OS upgrades after about 2 years, give or take. Have you ever noticed how iPhones slow down after a few major updates? It's just too much for grossly outdated hardware, to the point where some features aren't even included in the older phones. It's an update in version number only, to some extent. By stopping OS level upgrades but continuing with security patches and GPS support, an Android phone can be supported for much longer than most realize. Let's look at a few examples.\n\nThe Nexus One, released January 2010, lined up between the iPhone 3G S (06/2009) and the iPhone 4 (06/2010). Those devices saw their final software support in 02/2014 (3G S) and 06/2014 (4). However, the Nexus One saw it's last software update (via GPS) in February 2017. That means that many current applications worked with it (although there are a lot of applications that target Android 4.0 and higher for various reasons, a major hurdle for older hardware).\n\nThe Nexus S, released December 2010, is STILL supported via Google Play Services and will run MOST modern applications (with some limitations). Given that most iOS applications only target the current and preceding version of iOS (so, iOS9), that makes the oldest likely supported iPhone the 4S, released October 2011, 11 months after the Nexus S. Also, expect iOS9 to be deprecated with iOS 11 releasing this month, putting the Nexus S on par, software wise, with the iPhone 5 from 2012.\n\n**TLDR: Software support for Android hinges on much more than just the firmware version. The main things that impact your compatibility with applications are hardware/features, and Google Play Services version. And when you factor this in, software support for Android phones (especially Google's devices) vastly exceeds what most people tend to think. These devices are supported far longer than simply 18 months. Well...except the HTC Dream :)**\n\n##Requesting community help/feedback! If you see something incorrect, PLEASE correct me! If possible, provide a source or two.\n\n##UPDATE - I've confirmed the final security patches for the Nexus 4 and Nexus 5. The Nexus 4's last update was October 2015 [(SOURCE)] (http://www.droidsec.org/news/2015/10/06/nexus-update-october-2015.html), being discontinued prior to the November 2015 security update [(SOURCE)] (http://www.droidsec.org/news/2015/11/02/nexus-update-november-2015.html). The Nexus 5 received the October 2016 update, skipped November, but then got a final update in December, as shown on the [Nexus OTA page] (https://developers.google.com/android/ota#hammerhead) (OTA pages didn't exist for the N4).",

Texts cycle in the system for a couple of days until they get delivered. If you are making a call and the person you are calling has a dead phone, or the tower near them is down, the call may never register. However, a text will cycle in the cellular providers network for a couple of days until the recipient actually gets the text. \nThis is important to remember in hurricane situations when it may be difficult to reach loved ones.\n\nHope this helps someone!",

This essentially means that Samsung's Galaxy S9, which will presumably ship with Oreo, must be able to also boot \"stock\" Android Oreo without any additional configuration. \n\nGiven this, do you think it would be possible for Google to enable some sort of opt-in OTA to have a \"Google edition\" (AOSP/Stock) version of Android available as an update for people who purchase OEM devices with skins and want to update immediately and/or ditch their device's UI skin?\n\n",

(Hint: The fruit phone..)\n\nI've been using Android since Donut on a media player. My first 4 phones were flagships from samsung. I bought the iPhone 6s Plus because I was sick of Samsung and Android problems. Unfortunately for me the way I use the phone and the lack of a universal back button was something I couldn't live with, so I passed the iPhone to my wife and got the Nexus 6p. \n\nThe Samsung problems (delayed updates, bloated phone etc) were gone. From my past experience all my Samsung phones start to feel laggy after 6 months. My Nexus only started to the same level of lag after 12 months.\n\nAfter 2 years the Nexus gets much hotter often, has more lags and stutters and apps dying (Around 5 times more than on iOS). It seems to me that the sweet spot for Android devices is 1 year? The iPhone is 2 years old and still very pleasant to use.\n\n",

They found that they could hijack the accessibility feature to perform a specific form of overlay using so-called \u201ctoast\u201d notifications that pop up and fill the screen, with no need for the system alert permission. That tweak not only reduces the permissions that the user must be tricked into granting but also means the malware could be distributed from outside the Google Play store, where it wouldn\u2019t be subject to Google\u2019s security checks.\n>\n>When WIRED reached out to Google about the attack, a spokesperson declined to comment but **noted that Google released a patch for the problem Tuesday.**\n>\n>While Palo Alto calls its toast overlay method a \u201chigh severity vulnerability,\u201d it\u2019s not exactly cause for panic. Palo Alto notes that it has yet to see the attack used in the wild. \n\n- [Researchers Reveal New Toast Overlay Attack on Android Devices](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/researchers-reveal-new-toast-overlay-attack-on-android-devices/)\n\n- [Original group's blog post - includes video demo](https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2017/09/unit42-android-toast-overlay-attack-cloak-and-dagger-with-no-permissions/)\n\n\n**Summary of how it works:**\n\nBasically it is similar to Cloak & Dagger, but instead uses a custom Toast message (thus does not require overlay permissions - EDIT: it turns out even overlay permissions are not required if app is delivered by Google Play - see comments below regarding SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW permission) on top of a grant-admin or grant-Accessibility-features system dialog - thus hiding that from user by making it seem like user is clicking on an innocuous dialog box.\n\nAs the bleepingcomputer link above says:\n\n>Instead of seeing an \"Activate\" button, attackers can use Toast messages to make the button say \"Continue,\" instead.\n>\n>Further, researchers say that an attacker can loop Toast messages to appear continuously, masking legitimate content for as long as it's necessary.\n>\n>\"The Toast attack requires fewer explicit user steps to exploit and also can be exploited by apps that don\u2019t come from Google Play,\" Christopher Budd, Senior Manager of Cybersecurity and Threat Intelligence at Palo Alto Networks, told Bleeping Computer via email. \"Taken together these make this vulnerability more broadly viable for possible attacks.\"\n>\n>Palo Alto says all versions of Android, except the latest (Android 8.0 Oreo), are vulnerable to Toast overlay attacks.\n>\n>The issue \u2014 tracked as **CVE-2017-0752** \u2014 was patched on Tuesday, when Google released the [September 2017 Android Security Bulletin](https://source.android.com/security/bulletin/2017-09-01). Android OS versions with the September 2017 security patch levels are safe against Toast overlay attacks. [A video of a Toast overlay attack](https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2017/09/unit42-android-toast-overlay-attack-cloak-and-dagger-with-no-permissions/) is available on Palo Alto's website.",

            "selftext": "Hey there, I'm Jonathan Gurary, a doctoral student at Cleveland State working on developing new authentication methods for Android beyond the PIN/Dot Pattern/alphanumeric options we currently have available. I know it's perhaps not top on the priority list for everyone, but security on Android really starts and ends with the lock screen, so this is one of those things that's actually very important.\n\n\nI've come up with a new method based on color, and now I need some folks to try and demonstrate if it's viable or not. Here's the link:\n\n\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=passhue.dev.gurary.passhue\n\n\nBasically you'll set a password and recall it over the course of 2 weeks. There will be some demographic questions, which are optional, and a short survey at the end where you can tell me if you liked it or not.\n\n\n \n \n\n\nSince you guys are techies, I'll try to answer a few questions in advance:\n\n\n1) What's better about this scheme vs traditional PIN?\n\n\nA: Though it may not necessarily appear that way, it actually has a very large password space. That is, you can make several magnitudes more passwords this way than with PIN. It also may be easier to remember colors vs numbers and letters, and there may be advantages in stopping people looking over your shoulder, as it's actually quite difficult to recreate a color you've seen someone else pick.\n\n\n2) What permissions does the app need?\n\n\nA: Write permissions to store your password, internet to send me data about your attempts. It will also notify you once per day over the 14 day period, but you're free to dismiss it if you're busy.\n\n\nAny more questions, please ask away in the comments. Thanks!\n\nedit: Thank you so much for your interest everyone! I'm heading out for the day, but I'll be sure to answer any more comments this evening.",

            "selftext": "So last week Sony announced the Xperia XZ1 and XZ1 compact and almost every major reviewer has been bashing the phone  for its huge bezels and \"outdated design\".\n\nYes the Xperia XZ1 has huge bezels but so does OnePlus 5, iPhone 7 and Pixel to name a few neither of the said phones have stereo speakers and autofocus front facing camera...Also they bash the phone for having old design but Sony has changed its design albeit a little in every model since Xperia Z5 while keeping its signature look and feel. Apple does this well with their iPhones and so does Samsung since Galaxy S6.\n\nWhat I don't get is the hate Sony gets... Yes I know the fingerprint doesn't work in the US and Sony doesn't market their phones as much as their competition but I think the hate they get is completely unjustified.\n\nTo me it seems as if every reviewer wants every other phone to be exactly like a Galaxy S8 or an iPhone... Anything different gets bashed by everyone... You want a Bezel-less phone you already have that choice on the market. Bezel-less phones are fragile and maybe I would like having a phone with some bezels the are easier to hold and are more comfortable yes I would like for them to be smaller but the point is not every flagship phone needs to be bezel-less. \n\nChoice is good. Not all phones should look or act same or change the design just for the sake of change.",

After doing some research, it seems many people have experienced this type of drain on corporate and university networks. \n\nI solved it by toggling \u201cKeep WiFi on during sleep\u201d to \u201conly when plugged in.\u201d I was hesitant to do this at first because it seems to go against conventional advice that WiFi is more efficient than mobile networks. However, after reading that this is the default behavior on iOS devices, I gave it a try and I\u2019m seeing much better idle drain. \n\nThis still seems like an imperfect solution to me. Is there something that Android itself could do to harden itself against bad WiFi networks, or are our phones at the mercy of each individual router? ",

This seems to break Android/Keyboard functionality, and I'm not sure how or why an app is allowed to take control of keyboard input this way.\n\nThis decision has consequences for two primary groups of users: those who are visually impaired and those who are driving.\n\nSpotify subscribers have complained about the issue and have been given a variety of explanations from Spotify's support reps, including blaming the user's device to claiming the elimination of voice-to-text is a feature. \n\n\nFor those curious about what users are experiencing and describing, here is a sampling of complaints related to this issue that remain unresolved:\n\nhttps://community.spotify.com/t5/Android/Keyboard-microphone-icon-missing-all-keyboards/m-p/1561546\n\nhttps://community.spotify.com/t5/Ongoing-Issues/Android-7-No-Microphone-on-Keyboard/idi-p/1722289\n\nhttps://community.spotify.com/t5/Android/No-Voice-to-Text-Mic-Button-on-Keyboard/m-p/1716531\n\nhttps://community.spotify.com/t5/Closed-Ideas/Android-Search-How-about-getting-the-Mic-back-for-the-bling-user/idi-p/1735257\n\nhttps://community.spotify.com/t5/Android/text-input-search-via-voice-no-longer-possible/m-p/1597844\n\nhttps://community.spotify.com/t5/Android/why-cant-I-use-the-microphone-to-search-for-music/m-p/1735224\n\nhttps://community.spotify.com/t5/Android/No-more-speech-to-text-with-search-function/m-p/1576063\n\nhttps://community.spotify.com/t5/Live-Ideas/All-Platforms-Search-Voice-Control-Using-a-Microphone-Icon-for/idi-p/1650385\n\nhttps://community.spotify.com/t5/Live-Ideas/Mobile-Bring-back-the-Mic-Icon-on-Keyboard/idi-p/1566863\n\nhttps://community.spotify.com/t5/Closed-Ideas/Mobile-Search-Search-voice-command/idi-p/1597137",

Used to be a big Android person (Rooted phones, Nexus devices, etc..) ever since the G1, but Apple somehow sucked me in and has held me in their ecosystem pretty well because of their integration between all devices, iMessage, etc.. (have an iPhone, A-Watch, MacBook Pro, iCloud membership, Apple Music, etc)\n\nStarting to get really tired of Apples direction, as well as their pricing premium.

            "selftext": "I have always used Android smartphones, since switching from Symbian in what feels like ages. Went from Motorola Milestone (Droid for US users), Milestone 2, Samsung S III, Motorola Moto X (2013) and finally Samsung S5.\n\nBeing released in April 2014, of course the S5 is a three and a half years old phone, and because of that it struggles with basic tasks, lags all the time. Of course if you install a custom ROM like LineageOS things get a little better, but not much. In this specific phone, because of Samsung drivers, if you install a custom ROM like LineageOS or any other not based on the original Samsung ROM, the camera is transformed into a pile of crap. I know that's not the case with other phones, from other manufacturers.\n\nMy wife happens to have an iPhone 5S, released in september 2013, being essentially a 4 years old phone. I see her using it all the time, and use it myself from times to times, and it is SO MUCH BETTER THAN MY DAMN SAMMY PHONE. It almost doesn't lag, the camera is way better, pitcure and speed wise...\n\nWould having to buy a new phone every one or one and a half years to have a great performance a must for Android? I don't know, I'm tired, I'm thinking about switching to the next iPhone even though that would mean losing access to everything that makes Android a great OS, customization, and specific features on the S5 that I love such as IR blaster to control my TV. In the end, a great deal of my phone usage is to shoot photos and videos, and her phone is way, WAY better than mine in that aspect.\n\nIn the end, I feel like that if buy a Samsung S8 instead of an iPhone 7 (let's ignore new Apple release next week for a second), I'd have an amazing phone for 1 year, maybe 1 year and a half, and then it would start lagging away, while the Apple counterpart would still be a great, non-lagging phone for years to come.\n\nI happen to have a newborn daughter, and a good camera is a must for me. 99% of the pics we have of her are on my wife's phone / Google Photos account because her phone's camera, despite being older than mine, not only shoots better pictures, but shoots them faster, which is a must when you're talking about baby pics.\n\nPhew. Off of the chest. What are your thoughts about it?",

For example, security is worse due to open system, too many options lead to many similar apps (ie: messaging apps) not being as good as iMessage, etc.\n\nI have been using a jailbroken iPhone 6s+ for a time over a year. However, before that I had used 12 different phones within the previous year (2 different iPhones, windows, blackberry and many Android phones) . I stuck with iPhone because it just worked, plus I was jailbroken.\n\nSo what's the point? I like android better, but find iPhone's to be better phones, if that makes any sense.\n\nI gave my phone to my mom while I wait for the s8 to come in and have been using her Moto g4. Obviously you can't compare the two but I find even simple apps struggle. Something like twitter or even opening a photo. Even clicking the apps takes a half second to register. I tried my friend's s8 and if it very similar is done instances which leads me to believe it's an android thing.\n\nAm I missing something? Am I flat out wrong? Is it an android thing? Is there a fix?\n\nJust curious for those who can afford an iPhone, why you put up with androids being a little less optimized. ",

I'm not exactly the worlds best enunciator, and talk a bit too fast, but I doubt I'm alone in thinking it's just a terrible phrase for it. It does *not* flow off the tongue easily. Amazon has this figured out. \"Hey Alexa\" is very easy to pronounce and rolls of the tongue very fluidly. I'm sure Google has their reasons, but it definitely stops me from using the assistant as much as I'd like to.\n\nMy thought: The assistant needs a name. I don't have a suggestion for exactly what, but I think an easy to pronounce name would do wonders in making the assistant easier to use for people like me who are bad at talking. \n\nWhat are your thoughts on this?

For exemple, when you create a Facebook messenger group chat with your group of friends to organise a common friend's birthday without him knowing. Sounds familiar? Now imagine that this same friend needs to borrow your phone at one point, just for a few minutes. Can you feel the stress that any person in that group chat sends a message right at this moment, that would inevitably appear on the screen out of that bubble...\n\nSo I thought, what could prevent this? Well, what about a \"stranger\" option on your Android, that would block the appearance of any notification when activated. SMS, What's App, Messenger, all those personal informations that pop on your screen when received, very handy when you're looking at your phone, but so unpleasant when someone else is...\n\nWhat do you think? I searched for an official Android idea box to propose this but didn't found any, so here I am.\n\nThanks for reading!",

The emulated android \n\n* ran without any setup required\n* was damn fast\n* had google play services and google play store pre-installed so you could just log in and download apps\n* did I mention actually fast and responsive and a realistic emulation!\n\nI ran geekbench on it for the lulz and it got a score of [3427 single core and 8521 multi core] with 1536MB of RAM allotted to it from the 16GB of RAM on my macbook pro, YMMV.\n\nYou have very little reason to rely on third party resources for emulation needs now that google's solution is so refined.",

And for what? Infinity displays are nice but not a game changer IMO. Camera improvement is reaching the point of diminishing returns. Screen quality of my S7E still matches up to the best of this year for the most part. My S7E still has the largest battery out of any flagship made the past 2 years and is still going strong. Oh and it has a headphone jack. My phone is still extremely speedy and isn't significantly slower than the current crop of flagships.\n\nOk so iris scanning is cool, but I'm not compelled to shell out so much money for minimal upgrades, and unless 2018 has anything groundbreaking I can see myself using the S7E for quite a while longer. \n\nS7/Edge, HTC 10, OP3/3T, LG V20, Pixel owners, what do you think?",

Thanks to force touch you are always able to get back home without swiping up to access the nav bar. Just press firmly on the position where the home button would be and it gets you right back home. \n\nWhat annoyed many users was that when you wanted to perform the two other operations (go back, show recent apps) then you had to swipe up first and then press the button which is an extra step and disrupts the UX \"flow\". \n\nBut since the August update you are actually able to access the other buttons by performing a force touch and a direct swipe to the left or right. It doesn't work perfectly and I think that there is room for improvement. Sometimes I still accidentally get to the home screen and Samsung should address this problem with a more user friendly implementation. \n\nEven though this seems like a small feature, I think that this (if implemented right) is the next evolution of the Android navigation bar, replacing the visual obstacle with force touch and gestures and thus leaving more space for the application itself.",

Otherwise, swipe down twice and tap it and it immediately turns on for 1 hour but also gives the option to adjust that at the same time if you want to adjust. \n\nThis is totally different with Oreo. Turning on DND indefinitely is the same process. But turning DND on for a specific amount of time is WAY less convenient. Swipe down twice, tap the little drop down arrow, then turn DND on, then select one hour or adjust if you don't want one hour, then tap Done.\n\nIt may sound like a trivial difference, but I do this multiple times a day, every time I'm sitting down to a meeting or a movie or some such.

My guess is that functionality that should have been in Android 8 (the theming engine, because the light system panels need to have the ability to darken, the youtube website got the dark mode but the app not) is getting pushed to 8.1 and will be released alongside the Pixel 2 in October, so that means the Nexus 6P shouldn't have to get this update. \n\nIf this is the case I will be ultimately disappointed in Google again for the bad support they gave Nexus devices. If they DO, good on them. \n\nDon't burn me because i speak my mind, this is just a guess. I am just wondering how you see the future of the Nexus 6P after September 2017.",

Google should force big app developer to update their apps. This is just a very small thing with very big impact.

This is a lightweight version of Android Oreo 8.0 intended to run phones with 512MB or 1GB of RAM \u2013 far less than the A1, you'll note. Google has also developed a lightweight YouTube Go app, to be launched in the Indian market first.\n\n- [Android Go might actually make ultra-cheap phones bearable](http://mashable.com/2017/05/17/android-go-google-io/)\n\n>In addition to optimizing the OS for entry-level phones, apps like YouTube Go and Chrome are getting custom designs so that they use less data and storage space. What's more, for devices running Android Go, Google Play will promote apps designed to run on entry-level devices. \n\nMore at this reddit thread:\n\n- [Stealth, lightweight Android breaks cover - Android Go to appear in Xiaomi Mi A1 AndroidOne phone ?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/6ydpfo/stealth_lightweight_android_breaks_cover_android/)\n\n\n\n",

I really hope they include project Treble in it. They didn't mention the timing of updates and hope they come fast too.\n\nFor the price of 234$, this is a steal deal. I mean stock android with dual cameras (quality remains to be seen), USB-C, SD625 and a decent battery 3080mAh. Hope they'd slightly increased the thickness and included a larger battery. \n\nAs a final word, this is a fantastic phone for us Android enthusiasts at the price point and hope XDA welcomes it with open arms.

            "selftext": "https://i.imgur.com/NmPsbOv.jpg\n\nNOTE: Photo was taken by me, and uploaded to my Imgur account, which uses the same name here.\n\n-------------------\n\nWhat you're looking at in that photo is a Google Pixel XL on display at a big box retailer. Look at the top row of app icons, specifically Settings, Photos, and Retail Demo. You should see what looks like a watermark that says, \"Your Assistant by Google.\"\n\nThat's image retention. And while it's barely visible due to my shoddy photography, in person it was blatant. Especially in motion (swiping through anything made the retained text more obvious).\n\nBefore I go into why this matters (more so than obvious), I want to explain my modern smartphone history:\n\n* HTC Droid Incredible (OLED) - Purchased 2010\n* Samsung Galaxy S II (OLED) - Purchased 2012\n* Samsung Galaxy S4 GPE (OLED) - Purchased 2013 (and then swapped for...)\n* Motorola Moto X 1st Gen (OLED) - Purchased 2013\n* Google/LG Nexus 5x (LCD) - Purchased 2015\n\nI went several years using OLED displays and I always had the same problems. Notification shade, Maps/Navigation UI, and even the newer on screen buttons (home, recents, back) being burned in within months of use. Every time. I promised myself I'd go with LCD if possible, and when I got the Nexus 5x this issue became a thing of the past. I had actually forgotten about it. I've been considering a Pixel 2 when it comes out soon.\n\nThen, while looking at the Pixel XL at a local chain retailer, I noticed the image retention in the photo above. My memories of that issue came back and now I'm considering NOT getting the Pixel 2.\n\nOLED has a specific image retention problem caused by subpixel degradation. The 3 primary subpixel colors (red, green, and blue) do not wear evenly. Red and green are close-ish, but blue wears out at about twice as fast. Additionally, OLED is self-emissive. That means that each pixels lights itself, rather than a backlight (as LCD uses).\n\nThe end result is that color accuracy drifts over time, and brightness fades over time. Even if you aren't using a fixed UI and experience no noticeable image retention, your smartphone's color accuracy and brightness at 1-year-old are not close to how it was on day one.\n\nMany people consider OLED to be superior to current LCD technologies (TN, VA, IPS). And in many ways it is. It offers better response time (smoother motion), wider contrast (HDR without the need for gimmicks, black is black), and better overall viewing angles. It's just a gorgeous display technology...on day one.\n\nAnd this isn't to say that OLED is \"bad\" per se. Again, all technologies have their issues. But I wouldn't say that OLED is de facto better than LCD. And because of this issue rearing its head for me today, I am now more strongly considering the Essential PH-1 (IPS LCD) over the Pixel 2 (OLED). If it comes down to a tie breaker, the Essential's screen will win me over.",

This is not new but i thought it would be perfect for the notepad, since it lets you directly takes note from a book.\n\n**Voice-to-text :** This notepad accepts your voice input and convert it into text, further saving it to the note.\n\n**Speech-to-text :** Our sweet google voice assistant will speak up the words written in the note\n\n\n\n\n**How this app is different from other smart notepad apps?**\n\nThere are couple of points i want to convey in this matter :-\n\n1. I tried to keep the UI as minimal as possible. \n2. There is no other app with ocr,voice recognition, text-to-speech at one place, atleast to my knowledge\n3. The fonts and colors are specially made available according to needs of dyslexic individuals.\n4. Notes are saved as list items. There is a provision of instant preview of whole note in the list.\n5. Even though, i have included ads, but you can easily turn it off from ads switch provided in home screen. However, the switch will reset its position three days after turning off. But you can turn it off as many times. There is also a pro version that is free from ads.\n\n\n\n**Limitations**\n\n1. In order to use Image-to-text, you need to have android version above 4.0,\na good quality camera, a clear image, machine typed text (Not handwritten) and must be in english.\n\n2. Internet must be available for speech-to-text functionality\n\nI don't have anything to tell you anything else about the app for now, but if you have please feel free to ask.\n\n\n\n\nHere's the playstore link:\n\n\n**[Smartynote : A multifunctional notepad for dyslexia](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dyslexia.therapyapps.smartnote)** \n\nThanks in advance",

Macro performance is pretty poor as well - so fewer insect pictures.\n\nFewer people carry pocketable cameras now.  Yet the 4x optical zoom capability of those pocket digital cameras is not matched by mainstream Android phones yet.\n\nWe have seen retractable zoom cameras on android phones - but these early phones were not as pocketable because of the extending zoom:\n\n- [Image - Samsung Galaxy K - 20MP camera with 10x optical zoom](https://s.aolcdn.com/hss/storage/midas/e230763194408517f4283686bd3ab690/200244170/kzoomlead2.jpg)\n\n- [Image - Another view](https://s.aolcdn.com/hss/storage/midas/638a70e4cfb945029c320a28bc7982d9/200239890/P6061626.jpg)\n\nThe problem with extending zoom cameras (extending zoom Sony pocket cameras for instance) was that their bellow like mechanism would sometimes open up in pocket.  Thus the value of the non-extending Sony T-100 and DSC-T110 varieties above.  It is also possible that physical mechanisms like that use far more battery power than static cameras.\n\nThe one which comes closest as a pocketable android phone (with a periscope/foldable optical path like the Sony T-100 and DSC-T110 above) is the Asus Zenfone Zoom with a 3x optical zoom (smooth optical zoom):\n\n- [Asus Zenfone Zoom Review: Optical Zoom!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOn_hKoBs28)\n\n- [Screenshot of the periscope from 1:14 minute mark](https://imgur.com/a/824A3)\n\n\n\n\n\n**Dual-camera setups**\n\nRecently we have seen 2x optical zoom on phones - implemented as dual cameras on iPhone 8/Note 8.  Not all cameras use 1x, 2x - some use other combinations like 1x, 1.6x:\n\n- [Dual camera optical zoom technology explained](http://www.androidauthority.com/dual-camera-optical-zoom-technology-explained-781993/)\n\n1x, 1.6x on the OnePlus5:\n\n>the OnePlus 5, which offers up 1.6x optical zoom capabilities on the second lens before cropping down a 20 MP image to achieve a 2x zoom, and then relying on digital thereafter. \n\nOn the iPhone 7, it uses 1x and 2x optical cameras:\n\n>Looking at the iPhone 7 Plus, Apple has opted for one 28 mm and one 56 mm lens, offering up a 2x optical zoom potential. This means that we can capture close up shots with a 28 mm 1x zoom, and then simply switch to the 56 mm 2x zoom lens and capture pictures at greater distances without any loss i\n\nUsing two images at 1x, 2x, digital zoom is still needed from 1x up to 1.99x using camera 1 image, and then at 2.0x, you switch over to the 2.0x image from camera 2.  So the 1.99x image could look like a digital zoomed one vs. the 2.0x optical zoom.  This discontinuity can be glossed over with a synthesis that starts happening at lower zoom levels - so results from camera 2 could be used at lower zoom levels, as explained here:\n\n>To make this method a little smarter, the exact point of switchover doesn\u2019t have to be set in stone. An image signal processor (ISP) could monitor the noise level of each camera and decide to make the switch to the secondary camera only if it will produce better results. We believe that both the iPhone 7 Plus and OnePlus 5 are using a system similar to this.\n\nAt the very least a dual-camera setup ensures you don't have to use more than a 2x digital zoom at any time.  So it is still better than one 1x camera.\n\n\n\n\n**Synthesizing images**\n\n\nSome are synthesizing images to claim a greater optical resolution in their zooms - Oppo are synthesizing a so-called 5x zoom image from dual-camera 1x/3x images:\n\n- [Oppo's 5x optical zoom camera is like a periscope inside your phone](https://www.androidcentral.com/oppos-5x-optical-zoom-camera-periscope-inside-your-phone)\n\n>While the camera module itself is capable of 3x optical zoom, Oppo's touting this as a \"lossless\" 5x camera. They're doing some fancy image merging trickery, using data from both cameras to add detail to an otherwise digitally zoomed image.  It's not that different from what Huawei is doing with the P10, where data from the dual cameras is combined to improve detail and contrast. While we can't yet verify the claims of \"lossless\" digital zoom, my brief time with the camera was encouraging. Oppo's demo devices actually zoomed to 10x digital with a surprising amount of detail and steadiness.\n\nHuawei P10 synthesizes images from a 16MP sensor, and a 20MP monochrome sensor:\n\n- [Huawei P10 + P10 Plus review: Great phones, with one fatal flaw](https://www.androidcentral.com/huawei-p10)\n\n>You've still got two f/2.2 Leica Summarit lenses, one housing a 12-megapixel color sensor (with optical image stabilization and 1.25-micron pixels), another packing a 20-megapixel monochrome sensor without OIS. (Alongside laser autofocus for faster focusing in the dark.)\n\n\n\n\n\n**Prospects for real/smooth 4x optical zoom on android phones**\n\n\nTri-camera (1x, 2x, 4x) or Quad-camera (1x, 2x, 4x, 8x) are one alternative.  As above, no optical zoom moving parts, but reliance on image processing to synthesize the best image.\n\nMulti-camera setup do not provide a smooth sliding optical zoom (as in the foldable/periscope 3x optical zoom on the Asus Zenfone Zoom above) - but is a series of snapshots (1x, 2x etc.) which have to be synthesized via image processing.\n\nThe question is whether the battery usage from greater processing is still better than that which is used for mechanical zooming on the Asus Zenfone Zoom type devices.\n\n\nBeyond this we have multi-camera setups - with this $1000+ demo of the future from Light L16:\n\n- [Light L16 - with 16 cameras](http://www.androidauthority.com/beyond-dual-cameras-light-l16-dslr-725511/)\n\n>the L16 boasts 16 different inexpensive plastic-lens image sensors packed into a slims phone sized form factor. Combined with some proprietary algorithms, this allows the camera to offer up 52-megapixel images with a variable focal point between 28 and 150mm, which works out to roughly a 5.4x zoom.\n\n\nEDIT: Here is an example of a Tri-camera phone - however here the 3 cameras are of different type, and being used for depth and motion tracking, and may not be related to zoom:\n\n[Asus Zenfone AR World's First TRI camera Phone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0x8CfI5te3E)\n\n\n\n**Physical limits of greater zoom**\n\nFor the same sensor size, a greater focal length is needed to get greater optical zoom - which would normally require an extending lens (thus making the device non-pocketable).  This is solved by using a foldable/periscope arrangement for the optical path - as on the Sony T-100, and Sony DSC-T110.  And in the Asus Zenfone Zoom.  Here is an explanation of the foldable/periscope mechanism for the Oppo 5x zoom (actually as explained above this is a 3x zoom):\n\n- [Oppo's 5x optical zoom camera is like a periscope inside your phone](https://www.androidcentral.com/oppos-5x-optical-zoom-camera-periscope-inside-your-phone)\n\n>Turning the telephoto camera sensor so that it's pointing across the back of the phone and through a prism to see out gave Oppo more space to construct their lenses. This arrangement both reduces the intrinsic engineering challenges and cost challenges of having to miniaturize components and use expensive high-index lenses.\n>\n>The downside is in size \u2014 the periscope arrangement takes up precious horizontal space to array its lenses and is 5.7mm thick. It's small, yes, but space in smartphones is becoming increasingly precious. Oppo's demonstration device (not a production bit of hardware by any means) sported an enormous top bezel to give the camera module space.\n\n\n**Single image sensor approaches**\n\nUser https://www.reddit.com/user/HeadF0x brought up the Nokia 808 (Symbian 2012) and Nokia Lumia 1020 (Windows Phone 2013):\n\n>I'd like to point out that you neglected to mention the high megapixel/oversampling solutions of the Nokia 808 (approx. 3x zoom at 5mp) and Lumia 1020 (2.7x zoom at 5mp).\n\nThis seems to be a discontinued approach, mainly only seen in the Nokia Lumia line (in terms of public perception) - since Lumia did advertise the zoom qualities heavily at that time (also explaining the use of a 41MP hyper-resolution image sensor, from which the center part was used).\n\nHere's a sample of the Nokia ad campaign for Lumia 1020 and 41MP capability:\n\n- [Behind the lens of a 41MP Nokia Lumia 1020 - from 2013 - doesn't say much](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZ_KP2NO_bk)\n\n\nIf the Nokia Lumia 1020 used a 41MP sensor, then cropping down to the middle 1/3 would give a 3x \"digital zoom\" i.e. 1/9 size area or 41MP/9 = 4.55MP image size - which would explain the \"3x zoom at 5mp\" claim above.  This would suggest the 41MP sensor was a uniform sensor (and not a hybrid more-dense-in-the-middle sensor or anything like that.  The zoom was accomplished digitally, but because the sensor was so dense, even that gave a lot of pixels in the frame i.e. 5MP at 3x zoom.\n\n\nHere is a comparison of the Nokia 808 (good), Lumia 1020 (great), Lumia 950XL (weak), and the iPhone 7 Plus (great) camera zooms:\n\n- [Camera phone zoom test: Lumia 1020/950 vs Apple iPhone 7 Plus](http://allaboutwindowsphone.com/features/item/21719_Camera_phone_zoom_test_Lumia_1.php)\n\nEven though the Nokia 808, and Lumia 1020 are old models, they perform decently, with the Lumia 1020 performing at nearly the same level as the iPhone 7 Plus in the zoom tests above.\n\n>Apple iPhone 7 Plus: 44/50\n>\n>Lumia 1020: 42/50\n>\n>Lumia 950: 31/50\n\n\nHere is a comparison of Nokia Lumia 1020 vs. the Asus Zenfone Zoom:\n\n- [Zoom champion Lumia 1020 takes on the Asus Zenfone Zoom](http://allaboutwindowsphone.com/features/item/21216_lumia_camera_champions_versus_.php)\n\n>Whereas the 1020's zoom is all digital, smart-cropping down to 1:1 (at 5MP) on the 41MP sensor, i.e. the only moving parts are the usual focussing optics, the Zenfone Zoom has a 10-element optical system with twin 45\u00ba reflectors and zooming lenses:\n\nWhile we have examined the Asus Zenfone Zoom above as a 3x optical zoom using foldable/periscope mechanics - the Lumia 1020 is explained here as having a single sensor of 41MP size, which is of such large size, that even a digital zoom still gives good results - 5MP at the 3x zoom level.\n\n>Now, there are pros and cons to both approaches, of course. As you'll see below, the optical zoom can give stunning results, with the full sensor available for full detail even when zoomed, while only the inner 1/9th of the 1020's sensor is being used when zoomed in. On the other hand, an almost solid state digital zoom is potentially cheaper and almost certainly more robust - the longevity of an optical zoom mechanism in a phone is still something that needs proving.\n\nHe gives an almost equal score for both Lumia 1020 vs. the Asus Zenfone Zoom (using 3x optical zoom):\n\n>Lumia 1020: 57/80\n>\n>Zenfone Zoom: 57/80\n\nHere is another comparison of Lumia 1020 (41MP - digital zoom) vs. Canon Powershot S120 (12.1MP - 5x optical zoom):\n\n- [Putting Nokia's zoom claims to the test: Lumia 1020 smartphone versus Canon PowerShot S120](https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/putting-nokia-zoom-claims-to-the-test-lumia-1020-smartphone-versus-canon-powershots120)\n\nAnd one of the Lumia 1020 (41MP - digital zoom) vs. Samsung Galaxy S4 Zoom:\n\n- [41MP Nokia Lumia 1020 VS 16MP Samsung Galaxy S4 Zoom - with Sample Images and Video Comparison](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2BMxqyijoU)\n\nFor many situations he prefers the Lumia 1020 results.\n\n\n**Prospects of single image sensors in the future**\n\nOne disadvantage of using zoom this way (though probably not apparent at just 2x zoom) is that you are relying on the middle part of the image as having high acuity - when the lens system may not be designed for that (maybe designed for wide angle overall quality management).  Whereas with a separate zoom camera (as in a dual-camera device) you have the advantage of being able to optimize the lens system for the zoom.  Similar trade off with one-unit zoom lens vs. using separate 24mm lens and 300mm telephoto lens.\n\nI am also unclear - but potentially it maybe easier to do optical image stabilization with dual cameras - though using same sensor for all zoom levels, and doing image stabilization from that does seem more elegant.\n\nWith Nokia in the Android game, we may wind up seeing a single image sensor zoom - perhaps a Nokia Lumia Android phone.\n\n",

            "selftext": "**UPDATE**: I've decided to return the Galaxy S8 and get an iPhone, largely because of this: https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/6zbtue/samsung_makes_wonderful_phones_but_their/\n\nx/post from [/r/galaxys8](https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyS8/comments/6xwi5b/an_iphone_users_experience_with_the_galaxy_s8two/)\n\n---\n\nI'm writing this for iPhone users that are looking for a change and are on the fence about getting this device. I hope that this helps.\n\n**My Use Case**\n\nI'm a tech consultant. I travel 2x per week, every week, and have done so for the last 1.5 years. I don't consume much entertainment but do browse the web and call people quite a lot, usually by way of a Bluetooth headset of some kind. I listen to music frequently, but not *all of the time*. I also go to the gym every week and ride my bike whenever I am able and use fitness tracking apps heavily during those periods.\n\nFor context: I've tried the S6 and S7 as well as previous Galaxy phones and have generally bad experiences with each. I decided to get a S8 because of Siri's underperformance and the general desire of getting something new after a while (had it for about a year). I also got a Gear S3 to accompany it, which I'll briefly review at /r/gears3.\n\nYou can see a list of the apps I use most frequently at the end of this brief review.\n\n**Thoughts**\n\nThis is a stream of consciousness; if you are looking for the final verdict, scroll down to bottom for the TL;DR.\n\n+ **Pro**:  This phone looks futuristic as all fucking get out. While the renders on the next iPhone seem to suggest that Apple will catch up on this front, you will *not* want to go back to the iPhone after using this. The curves are beautiful, the screen is a triumph to use and there's no camera hump in the back. You won't want to put a case on this thing; I tried and returned it.\n\n- **Con**:  The back is super slippery. Falls right off your hand. You'll want to consider a wrap or tape or...something.\n\n+ **Pro**:  Despite its slipperiness, I love how it feels in my hand.\n\n+ **Pro**:  This camera is much more vibrant than any iPhone I've taken pictures with. Colors on photos really pop, even if not viewed on the phone itself.\n\n  To wit: we went to Fossil Rim in Texas a few weeks ago to feed and pet some cute animals from the back of our truck. Me and my iPhone-carrying friends took photos. Once my iPhone friends saw the photos my S8 produced, they told me, verbatim, \"You're taking the photos from now on.\"\n\n- **Con**:  Despite this, the iPhone performs better in low-light conditions. The S8 produces a lot of noise.\n\n+ **Pro**:  I remember people complaining about the placement of the fingerprint reader when the phone was released and how easy it is to confuse it for the camera lens. I agree that it was pretty easy to confuse the two at first, but that problem went away after about a week of use. In fact, I heavily prefer this fingerprint reader to the iPhone's home button placement.\n\n  Also, the camera has an oleophobic coating that deters fingerprints. I tried to dirty it with my fingers. It's more difficult than you'd think. Contrast this to the camera lens on the iPhone 7/7+ that are super easy to smudge without even trying.\n\n+ **Pro**:  Samsung Pay is significantly better than Apple Pay for one reason: ~~MLC~~ MST. I can use it at nearly any point-of-sale, NFC or not. Not so for Apple Pay.\n  (I lied; it's good for another reason: Samsung literally gives you $10 for every device you use it on!)\n\n+ **Pro**:  Remember how I said that I had bad experiences with every Galaxy phone I've used in the past? A large part of that had to do with TouchWiz. When I returned these phones, my parting thought was always the same: *Amazing hardware; crappy software.*\n\n  That problem has *finally* been fixed.\n\n  TouchWiz on the S8 adds a hell of a lot of value, especially in comparison to vanilla iOS. A few of the features I really like that I'll miss by going back to iOS: double-pressing the power button for the camera, all of the edge screens (opening MyFitnessPal to count calories, Expensify to do receipts or AA to pull up my boarding pass are so much more convenient now), DLNA/Wi-Fi Direct, swiping up to use Pay, always-on display.\n\n+ **Pro**:  Bixby can control my entire phone; a HUGE plus. Being able to go into apps and do a bunch of things or change settings on the fly by voice is extremely convenient. This is where the dedicated Bixby button is most useful.\n\n- **Con**:  Unfortunately, Bixby's other \"skills\" are still lacking against Google Assistant, and its voice parsing in noisy environments is dodgy. I also press the button a lot accidentally; I hope Samsung adds a feature that turns the button off when the phone is in your pocket.\n\n+ **Pro**:  That said, Google Assistant + Bixby is a VAST improvement to Siri. It's hard to understate how much Siri sucks; it's tough to give it up because it can be quite useful sometimes (like for setting alarms and timers), but it disappoints way more often than not.\n\n+ **Pro**:  This phone is super fast. My previous Galaxy phones got laggy after about a day or so. Not the case with the S8. It's a pleasure to use through and through.\n\n- **Con**:  It gets hot really really quickly and sometimes randomly. Uncomfortable.\n\n- **Con**:  Battery life is pretty decent, but it could be better. Some days, it will last me the entire day without issue. Others, I'm glad to have *some* charge by the time I get to a charger (usually 12 or 1am on weekdays).\n\n+ **Pro**:  Fast charging is life-changing. This thing can go from 0 to charged in an hour with the right power block. Even if you don't fully charge your phone, you can go home (or the hotel, in my case), shower, get ready and unplug knowing that you have plenty of charge to last the day. That wouldn't be possible with an iPhone, at all.\n\n- **Con**:  Another big problem I've always had with Galaxy devices is how Bluetooth audio quality nosedives when they are paired with and connected to a Bluetooth LE wearable. The S8 is, unfortunately, not an exception here. When this happens, high-frequency sounds like cymbal and hi-hat strikes either sound \"robotic\" or disappear completely. This does not happen on iPhones.\n\n  While this was a dealbreaker with past devices, this phone and the Gear S3 are useful and pleasant enough to use to tolerate this.\n\n+ **Pro**:  USB-C is great. If you have a newer MacBook or MacBook Pro, your charger will not only work with this phone, but it will also provide fast charging! Samsung even provides an extremely easy-to-lose MicroUSB -> USB-C adapter (Anker sells a pair for $10 with shipping).\n\n- **Con**:  The cable it comes with is kind of rigid. I like Apple's cables better. This is evident when you try to \"wrap\" it.\n\n- **Con**: The battery saver feature is SUPER aggressive; aggressive enough for me to miss notifications when not on Wi-Fi. I'm still trying to figure out how to prevent this from happening. It's kind of annoying, but not enough to be a dealbreaker...yet. (I haven't missed calls or WhatsApp messages, but I've missed notifications from TripIt, American, Hangouts, etc. and those are kinda important.)\n\nTL;DR: This is FINALLY the iPhone replacement I've been looking for...at least until the next iPhone drops this month. It is as beautiful as it is useful. I highly encourage anyone looking to move away from the iPhone to give the S8 a proper shot. You might be pleasantly surprised!\n\nAt the very least, it will make your iPhone look pre-historic lol\n",

            "selftext": "***EDIT*** *For those that don't know, this is a difficult thing to achieve for devs. Our issue for a while was that if you search the name of our app, \"Brain Blocks\", it was on the bottom of the Play Store list. Puzzlerama of all things was on the top.*\n\nFellow android devs/game designers, just a quick report on how we got to the top of our search term relatively quickly. Hopefully this helps someone as discouraged as we were.\n\nFor those with new apps/games with low downloads, I'd like to share how we got our game to the top of the Play Store for our search term in around two weeks.\n\n[**Our game, if you're interested**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.reduxgames.brainblocks)\n\nWe aimed for two things. Hit ~200 downloads in 1.5 weeks, and made as many backlinks to our page as possible within that period. All with $0 paid. How we did it:\n\n* **Feedback threads** Not spam advertising, but simply asking for feedback from other game designers app devs. \n* **Quora** There are a lot of threads on Quora were you are encouraged to post your game. We got about ~90 downloads from doing this.\n* **Twitter** Created a twitter, made a tweet with a link to our game, and another one with gameplay footage. Then, networked and followed as many people as possible from our domain.\n* **Kept rating high** I believe currently our game is rated 4.9/5.0 We were stuck at 5.0 for a while, which I was worried didn't look organic. Ironically, I think it looked worse with 5.0 than 4.9\n\nThis is pretty much it. Posted it in a couple IRC channels but I don't think that turned up anything.\n\n**Mostly posting this to encourage those that are struggling with Play Store search ranking.** It is possible to become #1 for your search term in a short time period. We were very discouraged in our first week as our app wasn't on the list. Now you can simply find it by searching [**\"Brain Blocks\"**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.reduxgames.brainblocks) in the play store. \n\n",

            "selftext": "This is mostly a marketing move, just like sensor size was with other phones like the N6P and Pixel. Neither of those parameters by themselves determine how much light the system gathers. f/1.6 doesn't do any good if the sensor size is smaller, which the V30's is.\n\nNo one in their right mind would state that the V30 with f/1.6 has lower noise than a DLSR at, say, f/2 or f/4, and that is obvious to most of us. But why exactly is that? f/number is determined by focal length divided by entrance pupil diameter. For example, to get a similar angle of view to the Pixel camera, a \"full frame\" DSLR would [need](http://www.anandtech.com/show/10753/the-google-pixel-xl-review/4) a 26mm lens. If you set the f/number to f/2, the entrance pupil will be 13mm. This is why the Pixel, with the same f/2 number, does not gather the same amount of light than that DSLR. In fact, the Pixel's entrance pupil is about 2.34mm only. Very small sensors require just very short focal lengths. Sometimes phone and compact camera manufacturers advertise a focal length that's \"equivalent\" to a standard \"full frame\" camera lens but the real focal length of the Pixel's lens, for instance, is only 4.67mm.\n\nI can't think of a better real-world example than the Pixel and the S7. The former advertised a bigger sensor which was true, but can't beat the S7 in noise performance in raw images. The S7 advertised a \"wide\" f/1.7 aperture, but can't unambiguously beat the Pixel either. They both produce about the same amount of noise at equivalent exposure settings (targeting for same shutter speed), and this is because their entrance pupils are not that different in size (2.47mm for S7 vs. 2.34 mm for Pixel). The Pixel has a higher f/number, and the S7 has a smaller sensor, and both basically cancel out their advantages of sensor size and low f/number respectively. Now, if they Pixel had the same f/1.7 number, then the bigger sensor size would have actually mattered. Vice versa for the S7.\n\nSee the samples from RAW in [this article](http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/11/21/deep-dive-closer-look-google-pixels-camera/#A_note_on_pixel_size_sensor_size_and_aperture).\n\nThis is a big part of the reason the V30's camera doesn't impress. Another part is the camera app like others have pointed out. Google has the right idea, with these tiny camera systems you can only go so far. Much better gains are to be made by applying clever computational photography, and that's exactly what HDR+ is, and why the Pixel's (jpeg) results are so well regarded, cause the raws are nothing special compared to competition like the S7. Microsoft is also [investing](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/product/microsoftpix/) on it. My Sony RX10M3 also has a noise reduction similar to HDR+ but not as sophisticated. This is where manufacturers should be investing most of their camera research IMO. It's the only feature that has actually yielded significant results in the real world. f/number (V30), sensor size (Pixel), and pixel size (HTC Ultra Pixel) as marketing bullet points, cannot claim that.\n\n**EDIT:** see [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/6xsemd/so_lets_nip_this_f16_marketing_thing_right_in_the/dmiczu7/?context=3) for a bit of extra discussion.\n\n**EDIT #2:** [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtDotqLx6nA) is a video that goes in-depth about this topic thanks to /u/CreeDorofl for [linking it](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/6xsemd/so_lets_nip_this_f16_marketing_thing_right_in_the/dmih25j/).\n\n**EDIT #3:** /u/poodz asked a relevant question, which frankly I should have included here, but I didn't have the data at the time. What are the actual sizes of the sensors being mentioned? Answer after his/her [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/6xsemd/so_lets_nip_this_f16_marketing_thing_right_in_the/dmipkym/?context=3).\n\n**EDIT #4:** For some reason this is causing some people to get angry, and I have been accused of deleting and editing when I'm proven wrong. *Please* take screenshots of all my posts if you will, I encourage you. For the record, I have not edited either this post or my comments, unless to **add** stuff.\n\n**EDIT #5:** ...to add stuff *and fix typos*.

Your right about it making the image low quality due to the mp3 format.\n\n\n*THE FIX\nSince some of my uploaded music is original, waiting for it to fix the image will not be an option. So what I did to fix it was upload, then go to the album and files, and remove the image (or just upload to replace) with the same image. However uploading it through Google play makes the image HQ and looses the blurriness.\n\nThank you!",

            "selftext": "Of every phone released since I've really been into the Android space, the LG V30 is the first one I have ever pined for and that's really frustrating. \n\nI currently have the LG G4 and owned budget LG phones my entire life (pre-paid phones what up). One of my major goals for my next phone was that it wasn't an LG and the Moto X4 was shaping up to be my next device. But the V30 nails everything. \n\nThe dual camera set up is exactly what I want, and while other phones, such as the Moto X4 - the other phone I was eyeing - have a ultra wide angle sensor, LG has had three phones worth of practice nailing this implementation and the samples provided by hands-on and first looks, prove that there are still refining. I don't doubt that the X4 won't cause me and others to say \"hey, that's cool\" but the V30 will make us say \"wow.\"\n\nDesign-wise, the V30 nails the bezelless look in a way that the G6 didn't. The G6 seemed very \"gen 1\" in it's bezelless design in a way that the Samsung Galaxy S8 didn't. The V30 goes toe-to-toe with the S8 in looking great and futuristic. I don't see bezels as an issue but there's no denying that an all-display phone just looks good. And comparing the X4 to the V30, I don't think there's competition.  \n\nIn terms of displays, LG finally stepped up to OLED and, having never owned a phone with OLED, I really want to give it a shot. And, of course, the Moto X4 ditched OLED - another tick LG gets that Moto doesn't. \n\nBut what about other Android devices? Samsung, while nailing boxes such as camera, design, and display, have a UI I don't enjoy, are iffy when it comes to updates, and generally dominate the non-iPhone space and I don't want to join that club(am I a phone hipster?). The first Pixel had guaranteed updates and the camera was great but the high price and a design I didn't fall for kept me from pining for it; the new Pixels might offer something better but we'll have to see. Essential's camera is bad for the price. HTC, Xiaomi, Huawei, Sony, OnePlus, and Nokia are hard to find for sale here, so why bother with a what-if and they all make sacrifices that are nearly deal-breakers anyway.  \n\nSure, I hate LG's skin over Android and, compared to devices like the Pixel and Essential Phone, LG won't have timely updates - or timely updates on a consistent basis -, and god damn am I not looking forward to another contract/paying upfront for a flagship, but I actually see myself overlooking these downsides for all the great things the V30 has. \n\nGreat work, LG. I don't think you're a great OEM - your bootloop past, your bad skin, your inconsistent updates - but I want your new phone so badly and so much more than any other phone released thus far. Bastards. \n\nTL;DR: I didn't want another LG, every phone since I had my G4 makes sacrifices, LG's V30 is a god damn home-run. I am upset.",

            "selftext": "[The Phones](https://i.imgur.com/Tq9ArOT.jpg)\n\nI've had the Pixel XL for the past year and have enjoyed it for the most part, but I'm falling prey to the small-bezel craze and like many of us here, I just get bored easily.  :-)  (Also, epic Bluetooth bugs.)\n\nEnter two new phones to try - the Essential PH-1 and the Galaxy S8.  I've had both for about a week.  Here's a quick rundown of my thoughts.\n\n**TL;DR:**  Sticking with the XL for now!\n\n**Pixel XL:**  Everyone knows it.  Great camera, almost completely stock Android, last-generation build.  Enough said.\n\n**Essential Phone:**  I REALLY want to like this phone.  It's the perfect size in the hand and the screen format is great.  The build quality is fantastic and it feels \"premium,\" as the cliche goes.  But going from AMOLED to LCD is, to me, very noticeable.  The screen is very good, but doesn't have the depth of AMOLED and doesn't support some of the cool AMOLED features like Always-On Display, Daydream, etc.  \n\nOne of my general problems with Essential and the Pixel, for that matter, is that stock Android has really started to bore me.  The Essential's ROM is sparse to the point of being ridiculous.  Zero convenience features, including even a swipe-fingerprint-sensor-down-for-notifications gesture.  The normal reply to complaints about stock Android being \"feature-poor\" is that you can download apps to add things.  But over the past 10 years I shudder to think of how much time I wasted messing with half-baked 3rd party apps trying to add a feature that would be much more reliable built into the ROM.  For $700, I expect \"something\" other than just nice hardware and AOSP.\n\nThe camera was actually a nice surprise.  With all of the crap reviews it's had lately, I expected the worst thing ever.  It's not, even in low light.  It's not quite the Pixel or S8, but I'd say it's average at worst.  \n\nThe phone has great design, but other things are downgrades from the Pixel.  Back it goes, though I still have it so feel free to AMA.\n\n**Galaxy S8:**  A completely different animal, Samsung obviously throws in the kitchen sink in terms of software.  The hardware is top-notch and I have big hands so the fingerprint sensor location isn't an issue.  \n\nBut the screen, while having the best picture quality I've ever seen on a phone, seems much smaller than the 5.8\" would suggest.  That's due to the tall form factor and the curved edges, both of which make watching content in landscape mode look much smaller than the 5.5\" Pixel.  I toyed with picking up the S8+ instead, but it's so tall as to be excessively tall even for me.\n\nSoftware-wise, Samsung still goes overboard but several of those features would be great in stock Android.  A way to change the audio path from a connected Bluetooth device to the phone and back is basic stuff that Android should have.  Ditto one-handed mode.  And everything actually worked, unlike the Pixel where I've had Bluetooth issues and random battery loss occasionally from the beginning.\n\nBixby was actually much more functional than I expected, but still redundant.  Too bad they don't allow \"OK Google\" from screen-off.\n\nI am going to return the phone because the screen size doesn't really work for me and Bixby.  I need something in-between.\n\n**Verdict:**  Keeping the Pixel.  While Android O hasn't particularly impressed me and the XL looks dated, neither the S8 nor the Essential had what I required to make the switch.  Maybe the LG V30 or Pixel XL 2 will do the job.  Seems like they may be pretty similar, so maybe I'll have to decide whether I want to have too many software features (V30) or too few (Pixel XL 2).  ",

            "selftext": "Full Disclaimer: I currently use a Galaxy S6 edge and have pre-ordered the Galaxy Note 8 to replace it. So take anything I say with a pinch of salt.\n\nFirstly I'd like to front this rant with my opinion that the LG V30 is a sensational device. It's a marked improvement over the V20 and builds on the solid if  underwhelming foundation of the G6, to make a true flagship android device. Whatever your views on the V30 vs Note 8 comparison, you can't deny that for a phone that is up to $300 less, it is much greater value for money. \n\nThay being said, the V30 (apart from the camera, which I'll talk about) isn't a hugely innovative device, l=if you look at the front of the phone; it is eerily familiar to the S8/S8+, the V30 even adopts it's own Edge UX to replace the much loved second screen on the V20. I find it unfair that the general community bashed one plus for (fairly blatantly) copying the Iphone 7+ in their newest phone, and yet we don't even mention that LG seems to have pulled the same thing with their V30. Frankly, the front screen of the V30 and S8+ might even be interchangeable /s. \n\nNow the camera is one department where LG has really innovated in. EVen if the F/1.6 aperture may not be an actual F/1.6 aperture (which it probably is), the photos that are coming out look great, the wider field of view camera is my favorite handling of dual cameras on a smartphone so far, and the huge array of tools LG gives you in their app is awesome. My only gripe; is that they've put all this effort into that brilliant second lens, and then they didn't bloody put autofocus on it. I can get the omission of OIS; Samsung engineers must've pulled a lot of all nighters getting that into their phones, and LG didn't need that. But no autofocus, why, we can see mid range dual camera phones with autofocus on both lenses. Apart from that, the camera looks to be superb, in terms of landscape photography it is in a league of its own.\n\nThe V30 is undoubtedly a great device and it's great to see LG maintaining their strong stake in the phablet market, but I personally feel that what they've given us is a great phone, but not some breakthrough revolutionary device like some people are making it out to be. \n\nTL/DR: Crazed Samsung fanboy says LG copied the S8 with their V30 and that it's a good phone but isn't a marvel of engineering, as some people make it out to be. \n",

            "selftext": "I have a Pixel XL that I've had since day one. I value camera performance above other things and I take a lot of easy day to day photos, but sometimes will use Snapseed to touch up a photo and get pretty good results for social media.\n\nOn to the phone:\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/AyXj0bt.jpg\n\nI was one of the adventurous souls to pay for an Essential phone. After all the drama, FedEx delivered the box to me today and I just started using it. I ordered it knowing that I have a 2 week window to return it if I don't like it.\n\nSo far:\n\n* Phone feels Premium AF\n* Screen size is nice. Things look smaller than on the Pixel, but Pixel is running Oreo and fonts are different.\n* Fingerprint reader feels as fast as the Pixel's, but the Essential phone takes a bit longer to wake up than the Pixel\n* Screen is LCD and looks duller and less bright than the Pixel's when compared side by side\n* Phone feels as snappy as the Pixel when first picking it up, but when I go back to the Pixel, I swear it feels snappier than the Essential. \n* Blobs are still there! (Obviously)\n\nCamera performance has been the big talking point. I love the Pixel camera for day to day shooting. I only tried the PH-1's camera briefly and the first photo I took didn't even save to the phone (to be fair, the Pixel sometimes does this and it pisses me off). I've been preparing myself to let go of the phone because of the camera, but maybe it will surprise me. I am not expecting software updates to magically fix it all.\n\nI installed the latest ported Google Camera APK with zero lag and it produces decent results. I've been using my Pixel and the Essential side by side to take photos in low light for about 24 hours, and I'm definitely not impressed. Coming from a Pixel, this is definitely not an Upgrade in the camera department.\n\nI've been using the USB C to 3.5mm adapter for work calls and it works fine, but Android seems to be missing a few tweaks to handle a USB C audio device better. The volume slider doesn't give an indication of a headphone or external device being used, but it does remember volume levels separately for the USB C headphones vs the phone speaker.\n\nIf you have been considering this phone as an option, I'll be happy to answer any questions.

They did a great job with the system sounds as they are all very pleasant and mellow as opposed to bloops we get on Samsung/LG devices. It\u2019s also pretty fast since it has no add on skin and bloat. \n\nAfter that, things get a bit messy. The camera sucks compared to every other flagship I\u2019ve tried this year and in addition to that I\u2019ve noticed several strange behaviors in the OS such as:\n\n* Chrome closing on its own while I read a page\n* Screen taps not recognized as quickly/accurately as modern flagships\n* The video recording produces a \u201cpop\u201d the first few seconds of any clip I make. No idea why. \n\nI\u2019d have hope they could fix the last two, but honestly with all the chaos already and the fact I don\u2019t think the camera will ever be great, I\u2019ll be returning this one.

            "selftext": "I have owned the Redmi 4 prime for about 6 months, and a month ago, I replaced it with the moto z play. Both devices have 3GB of RAM and are dual sim, with sim cards active at the same time. A comparison of the two devices, I think is necessary for would be buyers.\n\n**Price:**\nI got the Redmi on release for 140USD, the moto Z from Banggood for 250USD. \n\n\n**Looks:**\nOf the two devices, the moto Z play looks very premium. I would put it on par with Samsung s7 on the looks. The Moto Z play also has na oleophobic coating thats lacking on the Redmi. This means the screen on the moto Z has less of an oily fingerprint look. \nThe Redmi 4 is a 5\" device which does wonders for usability. The moto Z play is too huge, even for my large manly hands!\n**Bottomline:** the Moto z play wins\n\n**Battery:**\nThe redmi 4 prime has a 4050mAH battery vs the moto Z play with a 3500mAH battery. Thats a 12.5% decrease in the battery. The battery life is however very different. The Redmi often got me 10hrs SOT and 1.5 days of usage. The moto gets me about 6.5hrs of SOT over one day. This is what I miss most about the redmi. \nThe moto usually charges in about 30mins to full using the turbo charger included, while the redmi takes upto 2.5 hrs on the normal charger. The moto z play has a tendancy to heat while charging, the Redmi never once heated, or even got warm. I like phones that dont get warm\n**Bottom line:** The Redmi 4 prime wins\n\n**Software:**\nCan anything compare to stock?\nMIUI is really bad in usability and UI elements. Notification system is not the best, and its still running on Android 6.0.MIUI has a habit of over aggressively killing apps in the background. That means apple music and spotify will sometimes just close in the middle of a song. I did everything including deactivating the memory optimization feature, but it did not help. Finally resorted to using a buggy release of LineageOS.  Both devices feel very fluid and snappy though\n\n**Bottom line:** Moto Z play wins\n\n**Camera:**\nMoto Z play shines and shines again. I have not had such a capable camera in a phone in a while. I love it. The redmi camera is really bad. So bad that I only used it to take photos of work related items. I find myself now taking pics of random things because of how good the camera on the Moto Z play is.\n**Bottom line:** Moto Z play wins\n\n**Display:**\nOMFG amoled. Deep blacks! Popping colors. The Moto Z play Amoled trounces the Redmi display over and over again. I get why Samsung sells a ton of amoled screen devices now\n**Bottom line:** Moto Z play wins\n\n**TLDR:** Overrall, I like the Moto Z play. It feels premium, great camera, great screen, great software. I hope Lenovorola supports it to Android O and beyond, but Moto has never been very good about software support for ageing devices. I wish I had the Redmi 4 prime screen size and battery life though",

EDIT: earlier these countries were off and could not be turned on - this suggests either Google Play is visible now in those countries, or is imminent.\n\nI just noticed this today - I do not know if the countries all appeared together, or in a staggered way.\n\nIt does say in the pop-up help that paid apps will not be shown in those countries - only free apps, and free apps with in-app purchases will be shown (however, in-app purchases will not work for now).\n\n- [Screenshot 1 for China](https://imgur.com/a/oDBay)\n\n- [Screenshot 2 for China](https://imgur.com/a/POai2)\n\n- [Screenshot of Google support page confirms](https://imgur.com/a/zrIpy) - correction: Macau can download paid apps and do in-app purchases.  Source: [Supported locations for distribution to Google Play users](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/table/3541286?hl=en)\n\n\n\n**EDIT:**\n\nThe impact of this:  this should clean up the Android ecosystem of malware-tainted APKs (many Chinese \"app stores\" have app submitters who submit the official APK but with malware, or with advertising replaced to benefit the new author).\n\nAnd it should open up the market to android developers - who have previously not had a central location to target Chinese users (the Chinese market consists of a multitude of \"app stores\"  - none of which had a majority share of the market - and submitting apps for China was a chore in itself).\n\n- [How to publish Android app in Chinese app store?\n](https://startups.stackexchange.com/questions/3323/how-to-publish-android-app-in-chinese-app-store)\n\n- [How do I release Apps in China based App Stores?](https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-release-Apps-in-China-based-App-Stores-I-am-not-from-China-and-I-dont-know-their-native-language-as-well-but-I-would-really-like-to-target-the-China-based-app-stores-for-my-business-How-should-I-proceed-and-what-resources-would-be-required-at-market-end-for-the-head-start)\n\n- [9 alternative Android app stores in China](https://www.techinasia.com/10-android-app-stores-china-2014-edition)\n\n\nSo a very good move overall for the health of Android over the world - hopefully this will expand to in-app purchases and paid apps eventually as well.\n\nConfirmation of visibility of play.google.com in various Chinese cities (from https://www.reddit.com/user/IAmAN00bie ):\n\n- http://www.greatfirewallofchina.org/index.php?siteurl=play.google.com\n\n- [Screenshot of visibility in China](https://imgur.com/a/42h1B)\n\n",

With a little excitement i walked to the corner where they really well promoted Oreo, think about small billboard posters etc.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhen i got there NOTHING from android was to be found. Only new tastes, new cookies, cookies/chocolate mixed with Oreo but no Android.\n\n\nAndroid Oreo is been out for just one week i know but i would've thought we'd see Oreo android themed cookies but even when i try to google them i cannot find serious information about it.. I don't think it's that much excited anymore when they release it after months or something so will we every see Oreo android cookies, you think?",

One can feel it flinging left and right while walking & it does feel awkward. I have no choice but to keep my hand in the pocket just to hold the phone. Before the Galaxy, I had the MotoG. Despite being 140g, I could feel its heft too.\n\nI do love the weight of the modern Nokia dumb phones that weigh less than 100g. A great sport car should be lightweight but powerful.
