            "selftext": "Hi folks!\n\nI'm currently developing an augmented reality game with Vuforia and Unity. I previously released a completely free (And currently ad-free) pure android game with no security. There must be some kind of automated download-and-crack bot checking all the new Android apps, because before I even had 50 downloads it was already cracked and up on websites. The last time I checked, it was on at least 20 websites and the domain owners didn't respond to any of my emails (Big surprise).\n\nSo that brings me to my new app, which is taking a lot more time to create. I hope to actually monetize this one correctly and I eventually want to add multiplayer so it would require AN INTERNET CONNECTION! TAKE THAT PIRATES! So I figured I could use this to find people who have cracked versions. Then ban/report them.\n\nIs there anything that you fellow devs can think of besides proguard that could prevent/crack down on people trying to steal my stuff?\n\nThe thought of some little shit stealing my hard-made apps really gets to me. I didn't mind the free one that got no attention, but my new one is a much bigger investment.\n\nThanks for any help y'all can provide!",

Like a b2b company, a lawn mowing company and etc. Nothing fancy. This is just to get inspired and learn how it's done. I don't mind paying for the source code as long as it is not too much as i am on small budget.\n\nI have read the wiki and a lot of resources have been a great help.

What we're considering is giving access to all of those apps for a single subscription fee, then releasing regular updates to fit the model.\n\nLooking at Google's Payment APIs it looks like it should be technically possible to have a single subscription cover more than 1 app. HOWEVER I don't see many people doing this approach which makes me wonder if we're missing something.\n\nSo two questions:\n\n1. Am I reading the Documentation correctly, it is possible to share a subscription across multiple apps?\n\n2. If I take a paid app and make it free with this subscription system, is there any way to determine that an existing user paid for the app already? (so i can give them unlimited usage).  I have not found anything in the docs about how to get at whether a user paid for the app up front, only for in-app purchases.  \n\nThanks in advance for any advice.",

Multiple language is very important. \n\nI will help you translate to Vietnamese (both description and strings). If you can, let's help me translate to your languages. Everyone help me translate my app will receive a promo code to use premium version of my app and I will fill your name in credit screen in my app.\n\nLets leave a comment which languages you can do, and we will discuss more detail. \n\nThanks for reading.",

This Receiver then creates the actual notification and schedules the next Receiver, and so on.\n\n\nThis all works fine, but with this implementation, the problem is, that when one BroadcastReceiver isn't called, the chain stops, and no notifications are shown anymore. This is for example the case, when the smartphone is turned off.\n\n\nHow would you go about fixing this problem? Is there any other implementation that I missed for this whole thing, that works way better ?\n\n\nThanks in advance!\n ",

From what I've read, if you want to overwrite the default locale you need to implement some code in the onrestart() and oncreate() of EVERY activity in your app. That seems like a lot of extra work for something so simple. Has anyone done this before? Is it worth the struggle? There seem to be very few apps that let you change the language in the app settings but I can't be the first person trying to do it. I'm also wondering if there is an easier way. Is it, for example, possible to programmatically remove all the localization stuff in the app so that only the engilsh (default) language remains?

I am willing to put in the effort to learn android development everyday on top of school work if necessary.\n\nHere are some questions that I have:\n\n\t1. How did you get an android developer job? Did you have formal training in Android or did you self learn?\n\t2. I've seen some android developer job requirements. Some companies require you to show a portfolio of applications on the Google Play store. What if you do not have an application good enough to put on the app store? Will companies still accept you?\n\t3. Are there internship opportunities in android developer positions for fresh computer science graduates with not much knowledge in android development? (But willing to learn)\n\t4. Is there any courses for getting a formal android certification that's good enough for a job? \n\t5. What's a typical day for an Android developer like? Is it a lot of coding? Meetings?\n\t6. What is your salary like?\n\n",

Let me broadly describe you what we're talking about in its current, very outdated version:\n\n**What**\n\n- Reads the sticky intent related to the *battery status* and processes it according to some business rules\n\n- The resulting data is used to show stuff in a view, *as long as the app's mainactivity is on the foreground*\n\n- The resulting data is also used to throw a notification under some circumstances, *regardless of the app's activity's status*\n\n**When**\n\n- *whenever the user plugs the device*, regardless of the main activity's status, until the device gets unplugged.\n\n- *whenever the user brings the main activity to the foreground*, until the main activity goes in the background.\n\n**How**\n\n- A plain old *service* hosts a *timer* that repeats a *runnable* every second where most of the work happens.\n\n- *BroadcastReceiver*(s) are used to spot when the device gets plugged/unplugged and fire off the service.\n\n- The service is also fired off by the main activity's *onCreate*.\n\n- Unrelated note, *BroadcastReceiver*(s) are also used to let the service communicate with the rest of the app (a-la EventBus).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI'll be rewriting the app with clean architecture + mvp + dependency injection, which is fine and I don't need help with. What I'm really not sure is *how to make this app fully Oreo-compliant*: as far as I understand it, my service (a background service by definition since it doesn't do any user-noticeable work) would not be guaranteed to run at all (it would run for about 10 minutes after the main activity exits the foreground, or after receiving the broadcast).\n\nI considered using *JobScheduler* but the system is clearly designed for a very different scenario: relatively long workload that needs to be done in the background not necessarily immediately, under flexible conditions, and might be periodic but with a minimum of 15 minutes for the period.\nI need to run a very lightweight workload that needs to be done in the background every second and, under rigid certain conditions, absolutely immediately.\n\n**The questions**\n\n- Would a sticky notification turn my service into a foreground one?\n\n- Am I totally missing something about the JobScheduler?\n\n- Is there a completely different alternative I'm not thinking of?\n\nThanks in advance and have a great one!\n\n**Edit**: [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pumf_4yjTMc) episode of Android Developers provided a definitive answer to my first question, which kind of solves the whole problem. That said, I'd still be interested in alternatives!\n",

There are multiple viewers on available as discussed in stackoverflow- android desktop log viewer or do it only by the means of ADB (in conjuction with LineageOS bug report).\n\nFurthermore I found good explanation aboute the log levels (https://www.xda-developers.com/guide-sending-a-logcat-to-help-debug-your-favorite-app/) and message types (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14555268/android-log-main-events-radio-buffers).\nBut what do you do when you on the move with phone. I know there a plenty of apps. I used aLogcat root but it exported only a fraction of the live log, whyever?\nmLogcat allowed me to save huge logs what began before I connected it to a desktop PC.\nI cannot explain how that is possible sine any other viewer shows only live logs and may shows only a limited number of log entries.\n\nSo I would like to know how is the loging process started and how it is ended.

Although I understand the benefits it proposes, it seems somewhat convoluted (this is more than likely due to me having a java/junit mindset).\n\n\nIt does appeal to me as it is made by jetbrains. But then I became unsure for a couple of reasons\n\n* You have to use the [jack toolChain](http://spekframework.org/docs/latest/#_android) . I guess the docs might be out of date \n* [If you\u2019re using the JUnit 4 runner, the plugin won\u2019t work](http://spekframework.org/docs/latest/#ide-support)\n* [The assertion frameworks don't seem to have much of a community or are  made by individuals](http://spekframework.org/docs/latest/#_assertion_framework)\n\nThe exception to the rule  is `org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-test`but that doesn't have any documentation and I have to search in the kotlin repo to find it. \n\nSo after all that I am left confused.

Example \"Eiffel Tower\" or \"White house\".\n\nHowever, every 1000 query to the cloud vision API will cost me 1.5 usd. I would love to share my app with the world, but hopefully without it costing me alot of money. The cloud vision API from Google is really cool, and I reccommend you to try it out! So my question is, is there any way I can release this app without going broke? I figured I could implement a required ad to show after every x amount of queries the user send, but I am hesitant to overload the users with ads. I heard that every 1000 view of an ad generates about 2 usd income, so its probably not going to add up either?\n\nAnyhow it was a fun experience developing the app and getting it to work, but I am just curious if you guys had any thoughts about it?",

What is being used? \n\nHere is the setup... \n\nEither an activity or fragment has a presenter injected. It also has a view injected. The view is not an android view, it's a pojo that contains all the logic that the fragment or activity would normally have as a view in mvp. This allows view logic to easily be moved to activity/fragment/customview/dialog. \n\nThe view is as dumb as possible. It exposes user events through observables and allows data to be set through methods. This is all exposed through an interface. The view has no reference to the presenter. \n\nThe presenter is given the views interface in its bind method. It observes the views observables and sets data through the interface. The presenter interacts with models/interactors as you'd expect. \n\nWhat architecture is this? It's different from the mvp and the mvvm I see online. \n\n",

I would just use retrofit to consume the web api, but it don't seem right.\n\nTLDR: given that google places don't let you filter places by place type as the web api do, are you using any other library?",

            "selftext": "I've spent the past few weeks trying to understand how to properly create Android apps in the 'modern' way. I've read about and tried out [Google's MVVM](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/guide.html), [Hannes Dorfmann's MVI](http://hannesdorfmann.com/android/mosby3-mvi-1), and also tried to come up with ideas of my own.\n \nEventually I realized it all seems to come down to the way the View interacts with the ViewModel (Presenter/Controller, whatever you like to call it) - further layers like network access, system APIs or persistence always end up looking more or less the same. The confusion is mostly about the direction of data flows between the View and ViewModel.\n \nThere are two things that need to be happening in an app: the View needs to deliver user Events to the ViewModel, and the ViewModel needs to deliver a ViewState to the View. (let's assume that the entire state of the View is represented by a single class, as that seems to be the accepted best practice) There are also two ways to do these things: expose an Observable (or LiveData) that the other class observes, or push the new data into the other class. This gives us a total of 4 different approaches that we could take. I've enumerated them below with the names I think they represent:\n \n1\\. Plain old MVP\n \n* View pushes Events into ViewModel\n* ViewModel pushes ViewState into View\n\n2\\. MVVM, with [example here](https://gist.github.com/gstepniewski/e12efdf3da660173b8f56b11ee8ab253)\n \n * View pushes Events into ViewModel\n * ViewModel exposes ViewState and View observes\n\n3\\. MVI, with [example here](https://gist.github.com/gstepniewski/1499ec600224a63fd714f4964c362364)\n \n* View exposes Events and ViewModel observes\n* ViewModel pushes ViewState into View\n\n4\\. The last option, let's just call it MVRx, with [example here](https://gist.github.com/gstepniewski/e8f8549792afbd198eef16377dac629a)\n\n* View exposes Events and ViewModel observes\n* ViewModel exposes ViewState and View observes\n\n**Question time!**\n\nDid I understand the rules and implement them correctly in my examples?\n\nIf yes, which one do you choose and why?\n\nMy feelings are:\n\n * MVP does not seem to accommodate Rx/LiveData easily, so I'd turn it down.\n * MVVM is nice, but having the View push Events to the ViewModel could easily lead to logic being contained in the View\n * MVI is also nice, but the problem is that your ViewModel gets a reference to the View which could cause leaks\n * MVRx solves the problem of MVVM, but not MVI (you still need a reference to the View)\n\nI think I currently like MVI the most as it seems the cleanest - but I'd like to hear the opinions of some more experienced devs. Let me know what you think!\n\n**UPDATE**\n\nBased on the discussions we've had below, I've created [this project](https://github.com/gstepniewski/Architecture), which I believe illustrates what we've more or less agreed on.\n\nIt uses something between MVI and MVVM (single ViewState object and no references to View in ViewModel) and some of the most common libraries.\n\nI think it illustrates the relationships between layers quite clearly and is simple enough the even be used as a template for new projects.\n \nFeel free to give it a go and submit any questions of improvement suggestions.",

Please let me know if it's not.\n\nI've been an Android Developer for around 1 year 4 months now. \n\nMost of the friends that I've around work on the backend side. Their work mostly involves writing their own services or maintaining the infra. They are always talking about memory consumption of their services, applying multithreading to various parts of their service, the deployment lifecycles, increasing the req/sec ratio, trying out different databases and then comparing them.. etc, which all sound very interesting to me.\n\nWhereas working on the android client, I feel like I am missing out on all those things which as a software engineer I should be knowing/have been doing by now. My work on android doesn't require me to go deep down on the memory/database layer or threads or networking layer. I feel like there's too much abstraction that android provides/there are too many libraries that writing code with them doesn't satisfy my hunger and I am afraid that keeping away from using core cs concepts in my code for a long time would make me forget all these concepts. \nThere ARE some interesting engineering things to be done in the android client that we have, but most the time, I feel like I am just developing the screens as the product requires and doing nothing that I'd be proud of.\nThere are things like keeping it crash free but from an engineering perspective, what I am learning from a fact that we can't commit a fragment transaction after activity's state has been saved (just an example).\n\n\nSo, I wanted to ask fellow android developers that how do you satisfy this engineering appetite of yours?

Sending Raw PCM Byte Data from the clients to the server and the server is distributing.\n\n\nI heard it might be better with using SIP though. Do you guys have experience there? I googled a bit but im not sure on how to setup a SIP server for example.\n\nI read that SIP would be most likely the better solution for what I want to achieve.\n\n\nWould SIP be much better than what I have?

            "selftext": "We have an app which has minimum SDK level set to API 21. We are currently using support fragments and are now discussing migrating to native fragments.\n\nThis discussion of the move towards native fragment is because support fragment is meant for lower API devices which don't support native fragments. Now that every device has fragment and they seem stable. So why not migrate to native fragments for leaner implementation.\n\nNew features will hopefully be supported for native fragments with support library v13's FragmentCompat, things like ViewPager are already present in support library v13. But platform specific bugs will require API specific handling.\n\nOn the other hand with support library v4's Fragment we get \n\n 1. Backward compatibility with features e.g. runtime permissions.\n\n 2. Consistency across all the platforms as it uses the same implementation across platforms. No platform specific handling.\n\n 3. All new methods in next android version are available to use across all the platform.\n\n 4. Support library is released more frequently than Android platforms. So bug fixes will be faster and we'll have more control when pushing that fix. Don't need to wait for OEMs to update each phone but rather update the support library in the app.\n\nBut are these benefit enough to hang on to the old code which is meant for devices with API level less than 11?",

Is this what fame feels like? Much thanks for feature requests, UI suggestions, and bug reports! What a great sub. I'm going to work at my service job right now but I'll get back to work on the app and responding to comments later.\n\nI started learning Android development a little more than a year ago after starting to watch Udacity's tutorials. I had very little experience with programming before hand (some javascript with web dev). After a while of feeling like I wasn't *really* learning, I felt like I should just jump into it and start writing my own without guidance. \n\nWith *some* background in knowing illustrator I made some designs for my app and started writing it back around February. I worked on this as a hobby between work and school, sometimes giving too much of my free time to it. But anyway, I'm proud to say that I saw the project through to the end. By the end of the project, I definitely feel like I have a better grasp on how programming really works, but still recognize I have a way to go with learning best practices like architecture. \n\nThe app is a simple guide for making coffee using various methods. I put in custom icons and illustrations just to give it some flair. \n\nBelow are links to the Github, Behance, and the playstore link. Any feedback or criticism is welcome. I'd like to include this on my resume/portfolio.\n\nGithub:\nhttps://github.com/pattrickrice/Coffee-Brew-Guide\n\nBehance:\nhttps://www.behance.net/gallery/56755345/Coffee-Companion-App-Design\n\nPlaystore:\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.brewguide.android.coffeebrewguide&hl=en",

Does anyone know what test they use to trigger this error?  \n\nMy first thought is `new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW, uri)`, however, since other apps can register an intent-filter on a uri, I can't see them flagging any uri.  \n\nMy second thought is maybe they scan the string resources for anything with \"http://\" in it (or any url that a TextView would automatically linkify)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMy app does indeed contain links, but I specifically check to see if there's an Intent to open the URL, and if not, I show a DialogFragment with a QR code that the user can scan from their phone (example: https://i.imgur.com/mxi6wjC.png ).  I'm aware this isn't the prettiest solution, but for the limited times I show an URL, it's fine.\n\nI explained this in their *Appeal an app rejection from Android TV* form, and the next day, I received the exact same templated rejection, with nothing to address what I said.  I assume a real human didn't read it, or a human that does not care.  I suspect I will have to create two apk's, one specifically for Android TV, and one for the rest. But first I need to guess how they are detecting links to web content, so that I can remove the offending code and pass their automated check.\n\nThis TV_WB test must be fairly new, as my app is a fork of another Android app, and that one was approved for the Android TV.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nAny help or guesses on how they detect TV_WB would be appreciated.  \n\nIf you've had an Android TV app approved recently (within the last 6 months) and it had links to web content that were disabled on Android TV, I'd also appreciate knowing how you coded it to pass their test.",

            "selftext": "So the goal with Clean Architecture (CA) on Android is to separate most of your code so it's not dependant on Android. So in theory it could run outside of Android. But most Android developers use Java, so it would really still need to be in a Java environment. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nBut I was wondering, if you're using an approach like CA doesn't it start to make sense to write these layers in native code? At least if you have an iOS version of your app. That way you could share this code easily. I've seen posts about companies like Dropbox doing this a few years ago: https://oleb.net/blog/2014/05/how-dropbox-uses-cplusplus-cross-platform-development/\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAssuming you were proficient at writing native code, is this the natural next step? If you structured your apps appropriately, surely it would save a lot of time? You could still keep the platform specific things like design separate. Are there major pitfalls I'm not seeing?\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOne other thing - I'm no expert on Kotlin, but I've been learning Swift lately and it seems to be very similar to Kotlin. I also came upon this website that compares the syntax of the 2 languages, showing that they are nearly identical in a lot of ways: http://nilhcem.com/swift-is-like-kotlin/ If they are so similar, I wonder if you could devise a solution to automatically translate to one language. And then write this domain logic for example in Kotlin for both platforms. Then run some script to translate it to Swift.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAt least for larger apps that support both platforms, which will be supported for many years, I wonder if this is the *best* approach? I never considered it before learning about CA, but knowing that none of the code you share is dependant on the platform makes sense to me. In fact, that seems like part of the purpose of the architecture - to reuse this code on different platforms.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI'm curious what people think of this, and if there's any trend with other large companies taking this approach?",

            "selftext": "We had this conversation with my colleague when he presumed that Twitter Lite example will, in the coming years, be more and more followed by big Web companies and they will then drop their NativeApps support.\n\nToday Progressive Web Apps can do more of the same as NativeApps (I'm not agree with this sentence, but this is how they are marketed to developers by Google Chrome team), with offline usage and access to 80% of the Android API. And plus, they are crossplatform (depending of the browser/view which runs them).\n\nAnother middle-road point can be: if webdev really don't want to learn Java/Kotlin, they can, at least, use solution like React Native instead of PWAs. But in final, it's all JavaScript again, even if they are transpiled to native Android & iOS object.\n\nFor my colleague, the only point that refrains some Web companies to embrace fully PWAs is that iOS does not support PWAs very well, compare to Android.\n\nTo me, PWA can be a good solution when your \"NativeApp\" is just a wrapper to your website with some offline and notifications capabilities in bonus. For all other usage (Phone, Messaging, tools like File Manager, Music Player, Video Player, Games, Fitness...) I don't see NativeApps fade off, but maybe I'm wrong.\n\nWhen I read r/androiddev, it's clear that you prefer NativeApps.\nI personally prefer Native, but I'm not a webdev and I don't care about multiplatforming to iOS, so I'm a bit biaised for this analysis.\n\nDo you think PWA will earn some part of the cake? Or do you believe that NativeApps (and InstantApps, as they are just NativeApps with minor changes from your existing apps) have a strong future?",

I can't post link here because post will be removed. So PM me for link.\n\nIt looks like an app with a grid of buttons and seems like every button takes you to a webpage (maybe they are using webview) but it doesn't quite exactly look like the website.\n\nThere are a handful of apps that look exactly the same, by the same developer. And their websites run on wordpress. I suspect that they are using some plugins to turn the websites into android apps. Do any of you guys know what plugins they are using? I want to help my friend out by just hooking up all these plugins to a wordpress website instead of coding an app from scratch since she's on a budget.\n\nAny ideas help.\n\nThanks\n",

I did release some small updates, but nothing remotely related to any NDK work. The exact same APK finds and loads the JNI linked code fine on 5.x+, but on 4.x we get a ClassNotFoundException. I have tried rebuilding with the latest NDK, but these binaries haven't been touched in 18 months. Did something change with the SDK or the build system that would break JNI linking on 4.x only? Has anybody else seen this?  \n  \nedit: So wacky issue. I think the Android build system changed at some point and 4.x began to have issues with where I was initializing my native code (statically in the Application.class). I moved it to the more pertinent class and its fine now. Crazy.",

Your app is identical to an existing app on the Play Store.\". I couldn't understand what I did wrong, my game was not copy of other game, I didn't found any game with the same name, got no idea, why it happens. At a point 3. Of an email from Google I had read:\n\n\n\n\"3.Sign in to your Developer Console and submit the policy compliant app using a new package name and a new app name.\" I have thought, that I will just change my game name and all will be OK, but no. I couldn't get my downloads, rates, description of game back, Google without warning just removed my game from Google Play. I didn't want to release my game again, also I didn't feel like I did something wrong. On Google Play there are a lot of games/apps that got same names like other game/apps, have same gameplay, and Google don't see the problem. There are anime and other games, Google has no problem with it., so I had written to Google.\n\n\n\nAfter 3 days (today) I had received e-mail, that say: \"We\u2019ve accepted your appeal and your app, Stickman RPG - Idle Money Clicker (com.donislawdev.stickmanavoid), has been reinstated. \". Oh nice, so I didn't have to change anything ( I thought problem is with game name, so wait, if I didn't have to change anything, so nothing was wrong... My game was just removed by mistake (I think Google bot done it), so I got my game back, but my marketing I was doing has fail (people couldn't download game)...\n\n\n\nI don't complain, but Google Bot suck, removed my game from Google Play for 3 days, also I didn't hear \"sorry for mistake\", it's just like \"Oh yeah, so You didn't steal game, OK, get back to Google Play\". I must also say that, Google Play support (Humans) are very good, my issue was fixed fast.\nMy Game name is : \"**Stickman RPG - Idle Money Clicker**\". From fun fact, the game is also on Amazon Store/Kongregate, and all was fine there.\n\n\n[Image of Remove](https://www.wykop.pl/cdn/c3201142/comment_naqSFaSrUMwpMbxSyFH4Hf04VaGJKMgj,w400.jpg)\n",

I'm 23 (turning 24 in early October), graduated from college in the spring of 2016, was a QA Engineer for 2 months before being laid off, and am currently at a pharmaceutical company in the Bay Area automating Google Sheets with Javascript/gScript and creating scheduling tools for the labs. \n\nI really want to dive deep into Android Development because I really want to help people grow. I do not love my job right now, but love the ability to work with the end user(s) who will use the product I'm making and getting feedback to incorporate into the final design. Most of all, I love to make people's lives a little bit easier.\n\nTherefore, I think Android Development in the place for me. However, I don't know how to get off the ground per say. I tried the classes on Udacity, but haven't been able to dedicate more time due to my 50 hour work weeks. I need some advice on what I should do to invest in myself, and how I could land a entry level job in the Bay Area. I did a few classes on Android Development in college, but wasn't so into it until after, so those projects are something I don't want to try to use as leverage.\n\nAny help would be extremely useful.

It seems that there are quite a few pitfalls when doing that, it makes everything much more complicated and its harder to make a proper layout. For example, i watched a video, which explained, how ressources leak when you handle the orientation change wrongly.\n\nSo i wonder, is that the reason that most apps dont even support orientation change? It feels like the effort/benefit ratio is bad or am i just mistaken? Is it not as hard as i think?",

For layout ideas, I really like the Dragon Con app, so I will probably use that as the basis for my design.\n\nWe are currently using Attendify for our app, but it is limited as far as design and layout are concerned, and the Android app has an issue where it puts a title bar at the top on some devices, which is not present at all on the iOS app or phones such as the Galaxy S7/S8.\n\nThe questions I have are as follows:\n\n1.  What would be the most reliable method for pushing schedule updates to the app?\n2.  What tools/apps should I look at for designing the graphical elements?\n3.

A couple days ago I created a production release of my first Android app. After waiting a day and a half and posting around a bit I got 0 installs. Ouch. So I figured, why not take out an ad campaign on facebook? The prospects seemed quite good and I figured I'd at least break even on the ad budget.\n\nHowever, as the title mentions Facebook shows plenty of activity, but my Google Developer Console only shows 2 install events: both at 9PM, being uninstalled in under a minute. The last update time is \"1 hour ago\" and the Store page also only lists \"1-5\" installs.\n\nSo my questions is: What's going on here? Am I missing something? Am I doing something wrong?

I have read a few posts on how Samsung phones have been notorious for compatibility issues with app dev or deployment. while I do plan on getting other devices to deploy to in the future, I currently will only have the S5.

            "selftext": "I've been looking into different Android architecture paradigms lately and hoping I could get some clarifications. Personally I haven't worked with formal architectures at all, so I'm looking at something I could adopt that makes sense to me. Primarily because I want to be able to make decisions based on formal guidelines and logical reasoning, as opposed to \"this feels good\". Plus, if I'm working on a team, everyone should be able to make architecture decisions on their own, and not end up doing things differently. Also it should be easy to understand, as in, I shouldn't have to sit there wondering how to fit a solution into this architecture, it should be obvious.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe goal of any architecture I believe is to write _high quality_ code. As in, if you follow the architecture guidelines properly, your code should be testable, maintainable, extendable, readable, etc. This stuff: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_system_quality_attributes\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFrom what I've seen there seem to be a few general guidelines that formal architectures adhere to.\n\n1) __Implementation details should be abstracted.__ So, for example when doing a network request, I wouldn't know that it's using Retrofit or some other library. The implementation details could be changed and this code should not change.\n\n2) __Code should be organized by feature.__ I've seen some debate on this, but this seems to be the general consensus.\n\n3) __Distinct logical layers should be separated.__ This depends what you consider to be its own layer, but it seems like the layers are usually implied in the architecture's name. Like MVP, MVC, MVVM, MVI, etc.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf I missed anything please let me know, I'm just trying to learn here.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThere's 2 main things I'm wondering about:\n\n1) How do you break up other layers in your code? Maybe this depends on the architecture, but I haven't seen much about this in any of them I've looked at. For example, what if you have a Service that gets too big, or a BroadcastReceiver, or you network parsing code, etc.? Are there formal solutions for this? I'm not looking for \"use this library\", more so the high level concept of how to break the code up.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n2) Similar to my first question, how do you break up the defined layers of the architecture further? For example, MVP. What if my presenter becomes unmanageably large? Do I make sub-presenters, do I break that Presenter into multiple Presenters, some other solution? I have the same concern about the View layer, or any layer from any architecture really.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAny info is appreciated, links to suggested reading, specific architectures that might suit me, etc. Thanks!",

            "selftext": "So I just started working for this new company and they had an internal tool/client application so that our customer service can update things through a nice interface.\n\nThen a few years later (now) they apparently wanted apps for our customers so they exposed this api to some newly hired front end developers. Seems great because we have access to a pre-existing, tested api. There seems to be a lot of common calls, but then again theres way more calls that are not in common. This introduces some issues now when they want to change the output of some calls, they don't know which calls the clients are using exactly. So the clients proposed a split of the api. One for the internal tool and one for all of the outward/customer facing apps.\n\nSeemed like a good plan, but the backend devs say that they can't maintain two apis, that they need to create one api, and the client app devs need to know which apis to use and tell the backend which apis we use. What's the thought on this?\n\nDoes your company reuse it's internal api for it's external apps? \n\ninternal = the tool our customer service department uses\nexternal = not really external as in third party developers, but external as in customer facing client applications (this is what I use since I'm an android dev there)",

We have a work experience kid joining the company for a week, and have been told he'll be spending a day with us in the android team. However, we're having a hard time thinking of anything for him to *do* that won't be wasting his time and ours. He's around 15 years old and as far as I know *not* especially proficient at programming. (Of course, even if he was, so much of our work is domain-specific that one day is hardly enough time to get acquainted.)\n\nI'm looking for ideas to keep him busy. Ideally something more involved than fetching coffee :P",

            "selftext": "TL/DR : What are the usual JUNIOR android dev responsibilities and tasks?\n\nFor people who want details, read on :)\nI will be starting a new position as a junior android dev. This will be my first job having anything to do with working in an office so I have ZERO experience. \nI'm not formally trained. Self trained and releasing apps on Google Play. \n\nIt's fair to say i am NOT an experienced professional and any coding I do takes a LOT of time and it's clear I'm inexperienced. I have no idea what is expected of me coding wise and I'm very anxious about it.\n\nOf course, my employer isn't expecting me to be a wizard but I would love to know what juniors are working on normally on a day to day basis.\n\n I understand every company is different and there is no way for you to predict what I'm going to be doing. All I ask is people's advice based on their own experience so I can get an inkling of what is going on behind the scenes and maybe prepare and study on stuff that I'm not familiar with.\n\nI only have exp with Java/Android Studio for the past year. Nothing else.\n\nThank you for making it this far. Fire away.",

I started this project to learn Kotlin, Realm, Rx and to practice in general and this app turned out to be something that I am really proud of, even though the application itself isn't really good for anything. \nI encountered (SO) many problems and sometimes I felt like I never want to open Android Studio again. But now that I finished it (or at least I kind of feel like I did), I am really happy that I did open it up again and again. \nI wrote this app by myself (and with the help of tons of Google searches and this subreddit), I never had anyone I could discuss anything related to Android development. And I guess this is the reason I am writing now. \nI have no idea if there is something I shouldn't have done, should have done totally differently, used something no one uses, etc...\nNow that I am finished, I feel kind of lost. I would like to ask your advice, opinion that could help me learn and improve the code and myself eventually.\n\n[Link to the repo](https://gitlab.com/ftibi93/KotlinRealm2)",

Some you want to run on your CI on every PR, some on every commit, etc.\n\nSo what do you do at your company?\n\nI currently (sadly) only have Checkstyle running on every PR, but I think that it's not really that helpful. Seems to cause more trouble than it helps. I believe jake wharton also mentioned somewhere that he didn't use it, but I think someone from FB said they used it.\n\nFor someone that's on a 4 person team, and we want to catch issues fast, but we also want the feel of a company that's been around for some time. How should we set up our CI for static analyzers?\n\n",

These are not tech savvy folks so all the Oreo reporting must be Pixel devices which show up 7th and 10th place of top device models. Top 6 devices are Samsung based then Pixel, Moto Z, G5 and Pixel XL rounding out the top ten (according to Flurry).\n\nThose numbers are quite a bit different than stats shown by the current Google Dashboard for overall Play Store usage. Not a big surprise there, this app (niche product, must be one of our users, login required, no need to post link here, e-commerce based with order processing including credit card payment processing).\n\nApp is fully written in Kotlin and has 99%+ crash free sessions according to both Google and Flurry. Trying to remove a few rare stragglers with the release that went out today. New release targets Oreo in build system but is not using any special Oreo features.\n\nSupporting min 19 is not hurting me so I will leave it at that point for the near term future unless I see that count drop off even more.",

            "selftext": "I use linux and have some command line tools I use on my computer pretty often. For example 'file', to figure out what kind of file something is.\n\nRecently I rooted my phone (Pixel running Nougat), so I've been wanting to mess around with compiling different stuff for it and just figuring out how android works in comparison to linux. I wanted to add some of the common linux tools I use so I can use them from my phone when I don't have my computer. I tried to compile file, which seemed to compile fine, but it won't run and I don't understand the error it gives me:\n\n---\n\nSo, this is the process I went through:\n1. I used `apt-get source file` to get the source code for file.\n\n2. I extracted `file_5.30.orig.tar.xz`\n\n3. I had already downloaded the ndk: `android-ndk-r15c`\n\n4. Then I found [this](https://gist.github.com/nddrylliog/4688209)  link for compiling autotools projects for android using the ndk.\n\n5. I changed some options around in that script to what I thought fit my phone and version of android:\n  * set CROSS_COMPILE to aarch64-linux-android and set the path to it\n  * set SYSROOT to `/platforms/android-24/arch-arm64`\n  * set other relevant paths to fit those choices\n\n6. I ran that script instead of ./configure in the directory for file and did make and make install, which ran smoothly.\n\n7. So, that gave me a directory with the binary and libraries.\n\n8. I copied the binary `file` to `/system/bin/` and gave it permissions and ownership to match other executables there.\n\n9. I put all the libs: libmagic.so, etc in `/system/lib/` and set thier permissions and ownerships to match the other libs.\n\n10. Then I put magic.mgc in `/system/usr/share/misc/`\n\n---\n\nThe problem is when I try to run it from the shell as a normal user I get this error message:\n`\"file\": error: only position independent executables (PIE) are supported.`\n\nSo, can anyone help me figure out what I'm doing wrong? \nWhere can I learn more about correctly compiling autotools based projects for android?\nIf I were to compile it with static libs, would it be easier and how would I do that?\n\n",

Hit ~200 downloads in 1.5 weeks, and made as many backlinks to our page as possible within that period. All with $0 paid. The main things we did:\n\n* **Feedback threads** Not spam advertising, but simply asking for feedback from other game designers app devs. \n* **Quora** There are a lot of threads on Quora were you are encouraged to post your game. We got about ~90 downloads from doing this.\n* **Twitter** Created a twitter, made a tweet with a link to our game, and another one with gameplay footage. Then, networked and followed as many people as possible from our domain.\n* **Kept rating high** I believe currently our game is rated 4.9/5.0 We were stuck at 5.0 for a while, which I was worried didn't look organic. Ironically, I think it looked worse with 5.0 than 4.9\n\nThis is pretty much it. Posted it in a couple IRC channels but I don't think that turned up anything.\n\n**Mostly posting this to encourage those that are struggling with Play Store search ranking.** It is possible to become #1 for your search term in a short time period. We were very discouraged in our first week as our app wasn't on the list. Now you can simply find it by searching \"Brain Blocks\" in the play store. \n\nThanks for the suggestions folks gave in the previous thread. Helped a lot. \ud83d\ude42",

I know that size is defined as \"sp\" in android, but digging around on the internet hasn't given me any good answers on the best way to convert it. Most of the responses I've seen have just been to give my devs the design comps and my Sketch file and they will figure it out from there.

I heard that Google fixed some bugs there, and (presumably) the carrier couldn't mess with it (since it's packaged with my app). \n\nWould AppCompat go out of style then?",

However, I know I have a lot to learn and it all can be a bit overwhelming at times with everything I know I DON'T know yet. Since this is a field that's constantly growing and changing, I'm wondering how I'll know that I'm ready for a job in the real world. Making my own little projects and doing online courses is one thing, but I imagine doing job interviews and working on real products is a whole different story. How much Java should I know and how does one even measure their Java knowledge against what will be expected of them for a job? I feel like I have no way to tell if I'm a complete beginner or adequate enough. Thanks for any words of advice :)",
