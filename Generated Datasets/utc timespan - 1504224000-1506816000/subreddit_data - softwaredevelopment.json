Now, on the other hand, [the second one partially throws me off.](http://www.agilenutshell.com/assets/how-is-agile-different/continuous-activities.png)\n\nIs the second image saying that you do Analysis, Design, Coding, and Testing at the *same time*? Or is it simply just saying that you Do Analysis, Design, Coding, and Testing as a waterfall method but in short little chunks throughout the life cycle? Example being that you do Analysis Phase 1, Design Phase 1, Coding Phase 1, Testing Phase 1, THEN you do an Analysis Phase 2, Design Phase 2 ... you get the point.\n\nI appreciate your response, thank you for your time.",

            "selftext": "The Ports & Adapters Architecture (aka Hexagonal Architecture) was thought of by Alistair Cockburn and written down on his blog in 2005. This is how he defines its goal in one sentence:\n\nAllow an application to equally be driven by users, programs, automated test or batch scripts, and to be developed and tested in isolation from its eventual run-time devices and databases.\n\nAlistair Cockburn 2005, Ports and Adapters\n\nI\u2019ve seen some articles talking about the Ports & Adapters Architecture that said a lot about layers. However, I haven\u2019t read anything about layers in the original Alistair Cockburn post.\n\nThe idea is to think about our application as the central artefact of a system, where all input and output reaches/leaves the application through a port that isolates the application from external tools, technologies and delivery mechanisms. The application should have no knowledge of who/what is sending input or receiving its output. This is intended to provide some protection against the evolution of technology and business requirements, which can make products obsolete shortly after they are developed, because of technology/vendor lock-down.\n\nIn this post, I\u2019m going to dive into the following subjects:\n\nThe problems of the traditional approach\nEvolving from the Layered Architecture\nWhat is a Port?\nWhat is an Adapter?\nTwo different types of adapters\nWhat are the benefits?\nImplementation and technology isolation\nDelivery mechanisms isolation\nTesting\nConclusion\nContinue reading \u2192https://herbertograca.com/2017/09/14/ports-adapters-architecture/",

            "selftext": "Hey guys.\n\nI'm having a really hard time distinguishing the two (SDM and SDPM). I have looked through a dozen links on Google, but either I just don't understand the answers or a lot of people are contradicting each other.\n\nLet me start off with what my teacher says:\n\nA SDM is a set of guidelines of high level steps (Like Waterfall and Agile), used in software development.\n\nA SDPM is a low level implementation of a SDM, that specifies how you work and in which order (Like Unified Process and Scrum).\n\nBut then I come across an answer like this: https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/134276, which basically switches the 2 terms around, and says that the Process Model is something like Waterfall and Agile, and the Methodology is something like Unified Process and Scrum.\n\nI've found a bunch of other links where people seem to contradict each other and at this point I don't know which is correct, so my questions are:\n\n**What is a Software Development Methodology (SDM)?**\n\n**What is a Software Development Process Model (SDPM)?**\n\n**How are SDM's and SDPM's different from each other and how are they related?**\n\nBonus question:\n\n**What's the difference between a SDM/SDPM and a Project Management Methodology?**\n\nI would be really grateful if you guys could help me out with this headache!
