    "description": "**Cryptography** is the art of creating mathematical / information theoretic assurances for who can do what with data, including but not limited to the classical example of encrypting messages so that only the key-holder can read it. Cryptography lives at an intersection of [math](/r/math), [programming](/r/programming), and [computer science](/r/compsci).\n\nThis subreddit is intended for links and discussions surrounding the theory and practice of modern and *strong* cryptography. **Please note that this is a technical subreddit, not a political one!** The focus is on the algorithms and the security of the implementations. \n\n---\n\n[Monthly cryptography wishlist threads!](https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/search?q=wishlist+thread&restrict_sr=on&sort=new) \n\n---\n\n**Rules** (along with normal [reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette))\n\nDon't forget to read our [**RULES PAGE**](/r/crypto/about/rules/)! The rules listed there are also used as this sub's report reasons. The quick version;\n\n* Assume good faith and be kind. This is a friendly subreddit. \n* Codes, simple ciphers, ARGs, and other such \"weak crypto\" don't belong here. (Rule of thumb: If a desktop computer can break a code in less than an hour, it's not strong crypto.) You're probably looking for /r/codes.\n* Do not ask people to break your cryptosystem without first sharing the algorithm. [Sharing just the output is like...](/r/crypto/comments/1boxkg/-/c98x4ej)\n* \"Crack this cipher\" challenges also belong in /r/codes *unless* they're based on interesting crypto implementation bugs, e.g. weak RSA keys.\n* Familiarize yourself with the following before posting a question about a novel cryptosystem, or else the risk is nobody will take their time to answer: \n  * [Kerckhoffs's principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerckhoffs%27s_principle)\n  * [Schneier's Law](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2011/04/schneiers_law.html)\n* Don't use this sub to cheat on competitions or challenges! You're expected to solve such problems yourself. You may ask for help to understand it, but you should disclose the source. \n* Systems that *use* crypto are not necessarily relevant here, e.g. Bitcoin. Maybe try /r/cryptocurrency? Political news also very rarely belong here. See the list of related subs below for alternatives. Remember that this sub is focused on the algorithms, and isn't political. \n\n---\n\n**Resources:**\n\n* [Our wiki pages](/r/crypto/wiki)  \n* Threads on starting in crypto [one](/r/crypto/hnze6) & [two](/r/crypto/3izwdo)\n* Thread of [crypto links](/r/crypto/2jw4yo) - [older thread](/r/crypto/ih1z3)\n* [Cryptology ePrint archive](http://eprint.iacr.org/) \n\n**Other subreddits that may be of interest:**\n\nTheory:\n\n* /r/algorithms\n* /r/mathematics, /r/math\n\nPractical:\n\n* /r/netsec - Network Security\n* /r/compsec - Local computer security\n* /r/websec - Security in the browser\n* /r/security - General security subreddit \n* /r/privacy - General privacy subreddit \n* /r/compsci & /r/ComputerScience - Development and application of algorithms \n\nEducational, hobbyist:\n\n* /r/gpgpractice - Do your testing here \n* /r/stanfordcrypto\n* /r/codes - General code cracking\n\nPolitical and in the news:\n\n* /r/privacypatriots/\n* /r/NSAleaks - Snowden documents and more \n* /r/restorethefourth\n\nSoftware:\n\n* /r/gpg (fairly empty)\n* /r/bitcoin, /r/cryptocurrency - crypto applied to money\n\nRelated:\n\n* /r/cryptography \n* /r/encryption \n* /r/weboftrust (fairly empty)\n* /r/capabilities - A type of security model\n* /r/Intelligence - Espionage\n\nMemes and low effort submissions:\n\n* /r/shittycrypto\n\n---\n\nFeel free to message the moderators with suggestions for how to improve this subreddit, as well as for requesting adding links in the sidebar.

Alice goes to the emergency room, which calls her primary care physician for medical records and refers her to an orthopedist who later refers her to a physical therapist and an insurance company pays for it all. A lot of sensitive information is being sent between five parties and Chuck, naturally, wants it but doesn't know who treated Alice, so he will wait for her insurer to leak medical records and then de-anonymize Alice.\n\nTo avoid de-anonymization, Alice wants every medical provider to use a unique identifier for every patient (and sanitize their databases of addresses and phone numbers etc.), so that her insurance company has neither a single file with all of her treatments or a single file with the name of every person who was treated by a given provider. How do medical providers exchange records without exchanging their internal ID numbers (or the patient's name) and how does the insurer audit the system to make sure that they're not paying for fake patients? (We'll assume that the insurance policy covers any treatment that actually takes place and that the company isn't data-mining, because Alice lives in the *lightest* timeline.) The system also has to be easy to use, because one patient in the system will die without the medicine you're holding but it would kill all of the others.\n\nDiffie-Hellman comes to mind, because any two parties could use their unique identifiers to agree on a new identifier used to transfer records back and forth and the insurance company could make sure that the number of internal identifiers and communication identifiers match but:\n\nA) How would you deal communication-identifiers being duplicated by chance? You can't just do another round of modulus, unless I'm very mistaken.\n\nB) When Alice's insurance company inevitably leaks their records, could Chuck match internal-identifiers to communication-identifiers, possibly de-anonymizing Alice? (I no math good.)\n\nThanks.",

            "selftext": "What's the feasibility of indexing and searching encrypted text?\n\nLet's say you had a sort of radix tree indexing tokens and partial-tokens, e.g. \"TOKEN\" is indexed as hash(T)->{match, hash(TO)}->{match, hash(TOK)}-> ...\n\nNow, obviously, if you give me five hashes e.g. SHA256(T), SHA256(TO), SHA256(TOK), SHA256(TOKE), SHA256(TOKEN), it's easy to crack these one at a time:  I just have to crack the first one, then crack T?, then TO?.  Even if you salt them, I just have to brute-force five one-character hashes.\n\nSuch searching would have obvious merits:  if your browser used a PGP device to encrypt an e-mail editing form and the server never saw the unencrypted message, you couldn't search e-mail in the Web client *unless* the browser also produced an index update.  That indexing would reveal the content of the message, however.\n\nConceptually, you can compute a salt on the client end using the key and the token (e.g. salt(TOKEN) { return hash(Encrypt(pad(TOKEN))); }.  To search for a partial token (e.g. \"TOK\" finds \"TOKEN\"), you would have to point forward from each token to its longer version.  For example, H=hash(TOKEN, salt(TOKEN)) would give an entry H, and also H1=hash(TOKE, salt(TOKE)) which would then point to the entry for H, and so forth.\n\nThe server would be able to count the length of TOKEN in this scheme. \n Conceptually, you could use the salt() of the single-character prefix (or any random, repeatable garbage) to generate a few invalid pointers in prior values, using a PRNG modulus a small number (3 or so).  Deleting the messages to which a node without any longer matches points deletes those nodes and the pointers to them, which may leave more empty nodes; the invalid pointers would tend to stay, so it's analyzable over long patterns.\n\nThis approach provides a hash without its salt, and allows the client to come up with the salt from the token.  It allows the server to identify longer (and shorter) token prefixes.  It allows the server to clean up after deleting an encrypted message without help from the client.  It seems to me there must be weaknesses in this simple setup (other than that it's probably sub-optimal, huge, and slow).",

            "selftext": "So before I get into detail here, I'm going to say I'm a complete cryptography ignorant. A noob if you will. But I am starting a project for a decentralised blockchain organisational decision making system. The idea being that elected Administrators take care of implementing the tasks and propositions that people vote for using this platform. I am in the planning stage, basically writing down the classes and data structures I will need.\n\nI'm at the part where I need to count votes.\n\nEveryone on the network is able to verify a blinded vote, the only verification that really needs to be done is to make sure the user asking to have their blinded vote signed is a valid member of the organisation, and is able to vote. If someone signs a non-member's vote, none of their signatures for this poll will be accepted and the votes will have to rely on other signatures from other nodes.\n\nTo make sure that someone doesn't privately sign many of their own votes, the vote must also have a ring signature on it, but the vote is invalid if that ring contains a non-member, or the member who validated the vote (from the blind signature).\n\nThis prevents a person from making fake votes on their own, but doesn't prevent two people working together to make fake votes. So that is where a Traceable ring signature is needed, because the identity of the signer is revealed if they sign something more than once.\n\nThis is a real thing and it has been implemented in the various CryptoNote cryptocurrencies. But I'm wondering if there are any implementations out there that can use RSA keys, and could be used in a Python library. I don't know much about cryptography, and maybe I'll need someone who does to help me with this project, but if anyone does know of a signature scheme or protocol for traceable ring signatures, I would love to hear about it.\n\nThanks\n\nUPDATE: After a lot of searching I happened to come across this Python Library which points me in the right direction for implementing a Borromean ring signature. The library is in beta so I an cautious of that, but for the moment it appears to be the most trustable looking tool for the job: http://ec-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#module-ecpy.borromean but the problem is that this signature is not \"linkable\" or \"traceable\", meaning people could sign votes many times.",

            "selftext": "I had an idea recently that struck while investigating whether or not radiation is detected by digital cameras after noticing artifacts in videos from highly radioative areas (I.e Chernobyl.)\n\nWithin a day I had stripped down an old Logitech C310 and a smoke detector. Placing the AM241 over the sensor has produced brilliant and seemingly random displays of alpha particles. They appear as large white specs. (Found a great guide here: http://www.randombio.com/webcam.html)\n\nEssentially, the idea is to use the still images of the particles, which by my understanding would be nearly impossible to strike a single frame identically.\n\nI am not a programmer or cryptographer, simply a member of the community who believes in its values. I have a more than basic understanding of encryption but am far from anything like a mathematician, physicist, or cryptographer.\n\nThe simplest implementation of this I could conjure up, which may be entirely impractical and/or a misunderstanding of the concept entirely or at least nuances I've missed in my \"research,\" would be to essentially replace the coordinates used in Curve25519 with coordinates produced by processing the pixels in the stills generated by the webcam with a process similar to MathWorks Image Coordinate system. (https://www.mathworks.com/help/images/image-coordinate-systems.html)\n\nMy original idea was to utilize it on a central server as an entirely open source messaging platform, similar to Signal Protocol perhaps - with it replacing the Curve25519 - or a more relevant application in a similar platform.\n\nThere may be a better place or way to use such a thing. I have no idea if this would be something that could truly benefit the community or make any type of encryption any more secure in any type of application. Just as well, I have read vague allusions to it being used similarly but nothing  concrete. There are undoubtedly other applications for true random number generation and true random entropy using this incredibly affordable and simple DIY physical set up... \n\nI'm looking for folks to give me input about the usefulness of the general idea, and if so, looking for folks who'd be willing and able to work on an open source project to implement it. \n\nI honestly have no idea if I'm chasing my tail or on the verge of something beneficial and new.\n\nThank you for your time!",

But (2) is more difficult, and requires analyzing the target hardware which will be routinely used to derive keys (probably CPUs) versus some form of specialized hardware that could drastically accelerate it, like GPUs and ASICs.

I'd really like to hear any feedback you guys might have or any constructive criticism on how I can improve my project. I really like the idea for using cellular automata for this purpose, and I'm interested in advancing my project (if I can). Also, I just wanted to make note of one thing that differentiates my hash function from other CA-based hash functions: most CA hash functions like Damgard's use CA with cycles and patterns, I use CA that don't have any patterns (as checked by my Tally and Sort till the 57203th row), and I devised a method for filtering those CA that don't have any patterns (I explained how in my summary), but I basically looked at the complexity of the Boolean function that represents each CA rule for r = 2, 3 and k = 2, the amount of information entropy in each CA, and the file sizes of each CA (really large file sizes even after JPG compression indicate high complexity which is also noted by the amount of entropy in the CA) as a result of JPG compression.",

Presumably if the connection is over SSL the password is safely transported. The api then sends the password over to postgres to be checked.\n\nSo the way I see it there are two possible problems. \n\n1. The connection to the database might not be SSL.\n2. The password could be leaked into the log files.\n\nSo my idea is to do the following.\n\nThe API gets the password and then sends a hash of that password to the database. The database generates another hash using blowfish and stores it in the table to be checked the next time user wants to log in. This way I don't send the password to the database, the password doesn't get logged, and even if the database was compromised and the encryption broken nobody would get the passwords all they would get is the hash of the password and that wouldn't do them any good if they are trying to go through the app or to use that password elsewhere.\n\nIs this a silly idea?

The seven ciphers are all plain text and in proper English. Each cipher text is 62 characters long, meaning each key is used 2 twice to encode the that text.(inferring) The hint we are given is that the xor of two cipher text would give us the xor of the  plain text and that the xor of a space and a letter has an 01 in the beginning in binary form.  So using that this is the code i get. Using the code below i xor string \"one\" and string \"two\" to get possible space locations. Then I xor string \"one\" and string \"three\" to get other space locations. I then compare both list of possible space locations and values in both list are considered space locations for string \"one\". I then repeat that for all strings. But i'm still not getting the right answer.

            "selftext": "Hello, I would like to propose a solution for authenticating physical goods that are subject to counterfeiting (gold coins, medicine, banknotes, artwork, organic seeds, collector's stamps, vintage wine, etc.). It would come in the form of a cryptographic microchip sealed by the manufacturer into the object to be authenticated, or into its packaging if the object is too small (packaging must irreversibly damaged once opened). The printed circuit would include a microchip able to make cryptographic signatures and communicate via NFC, and small battery (rechargeable via USB when empty).\n\nWhen sealed into the object the microchip self-generates a cryptographic keypair. The manufacturer retrieves the public key from the microchip (the private key can't be communicated outside of the chip by any mean), generates a record data describing the object along with its microchip's public key, signs it, and records the data on a blockchain (dedicated or existing, not decided yet).\n\nWhen anyone wants to authenticate the origin and the uniqueness of such an object, they just need to place their smartphone near the object, then:\n\n* 1) A compatible smartphone app retrieves the public key of the microchip via NFC.\n* 2) The app retrieves the corresponding data previously recorded by the manufacturer from the blockchain.\n* 3) The app authenticates the manufacturer and its signature of the data record.\n* 4) The app extracts the public key of the microchip from the data record.\n* 5) The app send random data to the microchip via NFC to be signed.\n* 6) The microchip signs the provided random data with its corresponding private key and sends the signature back to the app via NFC.\n* 7) The app checks the signature, and displays information to the user regarding the fact that the microchip and the manufacturer passed the test, or not.\n\nThat's it. I think this kind of technology could be very useful in various domains, I would like to develop it as an open, patent free and decentralized standard. I need help and advise for that, can you help me?\n\nThank you very much,\n\nCamille.\n\nPS: The microchip functionalities could be extended, e.g. carrying cryptocurrencies cold wallets (a bit similar too https://opendime.com/). This technology is a simplified version of my main project https://checkoin.org/, which allows to reach the same goal with low-tech solutions (but more complicated to implement, I cannot find any help, TLTR I guess\u2026), more info about physical cryptocurrencies cold wallets exchangeable like cash on the site.
