I don't get much compensation for that other than $100 extra a month. When on-call I do have to be able to reply and if needed, get working in 30 minutes or less. I have 4 different mailboxes for different clients. This obviously means I always have work in the back of my head as I do daily activities even though so far, I've never had to drop something I'm doing away from home to go and fix it.\n\nAm I being \"overused\"?\n\nMaybe this is because work (DBA) or just because of everything else I said but I feel like there hasn't been that many new projects that excite me. I do get to work with some cool things every once in a while. Other than that, I feel like I'm doing too much of the same ol' day to day activities. Because we're consultants, I can't just go around and bill my clients because I felt like improving their system because not all of them want to pay...  Due to the low amount of dba at the company, I wasn't able to get myself removed from some of the rosters and therefor am \"stuck\".\n\nI've been thinking about moving to BI Dev for a while now as my background before moving to a DBA position was .Net developer. The job I'm currently aiming at would be MSSQL with IBM Cognos and it's a fairly big company.\n\nIs BI Dev good as a career? I assume that I may have to do overtime from time to time but unlikely to be on-call. Changing job/career path feels somewhat scary I have to say.\n\nThanks in advance for any advice you may have.",

We\u2019ve built a database for DApps that is powered by blockchain. It\u2019s designed to replace traditional noSQL databases. It\u2019s fast, secure, and reliable. \n\nWe started off building blockchain applications for big banks and insurers.  We needed a database layer and quickly discovered that a traditional cloud-based database wasn\u2019t going to cut it. So, the idea came to build a new database system from scratch that uses blockchain technologies.  \n\nWe have a white paper which explains it all, which we\u2019re going to release soon (if you want, you can join our slack channel for early access to that). I can tell you that the product is actually damn good. Your database is split up into \u2018shards\u2019, then stored on \u2018swarms\u2019 (clusters) of computers (nodes) which simultaneously earn participants money whilst being used as access points. \n\nThis solves so many of the problems with cloud-based databases. There\u2019s no single point of failure, the swarms are dynamically located for optimal speed, and being powered by blockchain, it\u2019s naturally very secure. \n\nWe\u2019re looking for early feedback so we can build a great product. My question to the community is: do you think this has value to you, or DApp developers? If not, why?\n\nThank you in advance.\n\nPavel Bains, CEO at Bluzelle (bluzelle.com) ",
