            "selftext": "Just curious if anybody else find it surprising that Bokeh doesn't support Pandas dataframe as well as they would like as compared to plotly? Bokeh, seaborn, dask, pandas, et. el. are all part of the pydata organization.  So I was surprised for instance, if you make a Bokeh chart of multiple lines from a pandas dataframe, the hover tool doesn't include the column names.  It includes the (x,y) coordinates and index value, but omits the line labels!!!  Hmmm...wow.  One of the usefulness of the hover tool is when you have multiple lines, you want to easily identify the corresponding line label.  In Bokeh, to get the line labels/column names in the hover tool you have to create a ColumnDataSource object from the Pandas dataframe, create a Hover object, and then use a FOR loop to render each line, otherwise resort to using HoloViews (a higher level API around Bokeh), which I still don't see how to get line labels.  So I look into HoloViews further and I also find out it doesn't support pandas dataframe index, you have to resort to doing an additional reset_index() per their [doc](http://dev.holoviews.org/Tutorials/Pandas_Conversion.html).\n\nPlotly surprisingly supports Pandas dataframes more completely compared to Bokeh (shows column names/line labels in the hover tool) and supports dataframe index.  This is part of the major reason why it looks like I will have to stick with Plotly for interactive visualizations.  If I have a need for a viz server or plot billions of data points, then I'll use Bokeh.",

However, I am debating trying to transition my job from academia to data analyst around May.\n\nMy questions for this community: \n1) Both in terms of learning new things and interacting with potential employers, is the upcoming PyData conference in New York something that I would benefit from attending?\n\n2) Has anybody attended in the past? What was your experience like?\n\n3) If I decide to attend, how should I prepare?\n\nI should also mention that my college will pay between 50-75% of my total expenses.\n\nI appreciate any thoughts!\n",
