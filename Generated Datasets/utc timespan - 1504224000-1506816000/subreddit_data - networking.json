I'll try to break it down as best I can here.\n\nI have a Dell managed switch, it's just a small 8 port deal, nothing fancy.\n\nLet's say I've got two hosts, 10.0.1.1 and 10.0.1.2, both on a /24 subnet. These hosts have no awareness of VLANs, they only deal in untagged traffic.\n\nI start up the switch in unmanaged mode, and it's just a dumb switch. I can plug those two hosts into any two ports and they can ping each other just fine.\n\nNow, I put the switch into managed mode with it's default configuration. When I do this, all interfaces are assigned a PVID of 1, and they're all set to untagged for 1. The result is the same as unmanaged - plug the hosts into any pair of ports, and they can talk.\n\nNow, let's say I create a new VLAN, 100, and set ports 4 through 8 to PVID=100, Untagged for 100.\n\nAt this point it's like my switch has been split in two, right? \nIf I plug my both my hosts into any of ports 1-4 they can talk, and if I plug them into 6-8 they can talk, but if I plug one into port 1, and the other into port 7 they can't, because different VLANs.\n\nHere's the thing that I'm not getting though. When I set the PVID for a switch port, I also have to set its VLAN membership, otherwise I get no communication.\n\nWouldn't it make sense to just automatically set membership when you select a PVID? Is there a reason you ever wouldn't want to? - i.e. have say, port 8 have a PVID of 100, but NOT set the port as untagged for 100?\n\nIs this configuration nonsensical, or is it just that by not selecting 'untagged 100' for that interface the traffic is still coming out with a tag on it, and my host doesn't understand that? Or something entirely different? Like I said, VLAN's aren't my strongest point, that's why I'm experimenting and trying to learn this stuff.",

The phase 1 goal is to still run our services on-prem, but have all our ingress traffic, mostly https,  some sftp and site-to-site VPNs, come via AWS. For example, run our web traffic through Route53 > CloudFront > AWS WAF > AWS ALB > On-Prem servers via Direct Connect. Future phases will involve moving services from on-prem to AWS. For customer site-to-site VPNs, we'll establish tunnels between our on-prem equipment and CSR1000s in AWS.\n\nThe topology would be https://imgur.com/a/7ONA1\n\nOur Direct Connects would be terminating on our Internet edge routers, these currently advertise our Public IP space. I was thinking to have our current Internet traffic in a VRF and all our AWS traffic in a separate VRF, these would eventually end up at sub-interfaces on our Firewall.\n\nOn the firewall we would have a route to 0.0.0.0/0 via the ISP. VPC routes received via direct connect would be redistributed from BGP into OSPF between the routers and firewall.\n\nWe'll also have a AWS public virtual interface from AWS, would it be best to advertise our public IPs to AWS, or NAT everything to an AWS supplied IP for this traffic?\n\nWith the topology as it is above, I guess the traffic will be asymmetrically routed (outbound via ISP), but I think this should be ok. Eventually, we'd probably shift our outbound to go via the CSR1000s in AWS, so nothing flows out via the ISP.\n\nI've got this labbed up and working within VIRL, just wondering if I'm heading down the right path, or if I've overlooked something that is going to come back and kick me in the a$$ later, especially security wise? I'd prefer not to have the Direct Connects on the same routers as our internet traffic, but unfortunately, that's what I've got to work with, so will have to lock it down with ACLs and hardening guidelines.\n\nThanks!",

As you can see traffic always goes through at least two firewalls.

We have something like 20k users and huge amount of /22-/24 private networks and managing them at the moment is quite pain in the ass. Currently we just point the default in VRF to a firewall, and the local FW has default to the transit VRF and the local networks statically configured to point towards the citys network. This also is pain in the ass to manage static routes in multiple places :)\n\nAny suggestions how to optimize this? Run OSPF/BGP in the firewalls? Try to code some scripts in Python to manage the static routes and fw objects? Completely redesign the network? \n\nThank you for all the ideas",

            "selftext": "At my workplace, we have a headquarters site and about 100 remote sites which connect into headquarters. The remote sites connect back to headquarters using MPLS.\n\nThe problem with our current setup, as you can probably imagine, is that bandwidth is pretty limited. Most of our sites have 4Mbps, which is not optimal as we work on migrating to some cloud apps. All of the traffic from the remote sites route over to headquarters before moving on to their destination.\n\nWe've looked into SD-WAN a bit, but my understanding is that it should have two different circuits at each branch, which is pretty difficult as a lot of the remote sites are...well, a bit remote. There aren't a lot of Internet providers for the sites currently available. It's possible we could sell having to pay for the \"last mile\" to connect to offices, but it would be tough trying to do that for two ISPs to each remote site. We don't think having one broadband connection and one MPLS connection at each site would really be cost-effective, but we've discussed the option.\n\nCurrently, we don't have redundant links at each site, so that's not a big consideration for us. I've thought about axing MPLS at the sites, getting a broadband connection at each site, then have the remote sites connect to headquarters via site-to-site VPN. We'd have to get a beefier firewall for headquarters, but that solution would improve bandwidth for the remote sites considerably. The main downside to this plan is that the business is dependent on voice.

            "selftext": "As the title says my office is failing PCI Compliance. I am in need of some explanation for a few things. To start, the business is a help desk for local small business and residents. We take credit cards through a small card reader connected to the ethernet and do not store any card info locally. We have two locations that are connected via a site to site Cisco VPN (RV042G) and I believe it may be causing some of the failures. Listed below are all of the failure points reported by Trustwave: \n\nBlock cipher algorithms with block size of 64 bits (like DES and 3DES) birthday attack known as Sweet32, CVE-20162183\n\nSSL Certificate Public Key Too Small\n\nSSLv3 Supported\n\nTLSv1.0 Supported\n\nSSL version 3 protocol padding oracle attack (POODLE), CVE2014-3566\n\nSSL/TLS Weak Encryption Algorithms, CVE-2013-2566 CVE-2015-2808\n\nI have been doing research for days on what these are and how to fix them but have gotten nowhere. Our two stores are being charged monthly for these failures and I have been tasked with the job of becoming compliant. I have seen the suggestion for adding another phone line for the credit reader but that would increase our monthly cost, which is not an option. It was suggested to use the provided fixes from Trustwave but I could not find anything that resembled a fix for any of the vulnerabilities. \n\nI have read many fixes on forums for some of these vulnerabilities but nowhere do they specify where I am actually making these fixes. I have 3 Windows workstations at my office and there are about 6 workstations and 2 servers at our other location. In my office, I have an ISP provided modem converting the cable to an off the shelf wi-fi AP. I can update this post with the networking hardware for our other location as it has been over a year since I have been there. Our server is used or Quickbooks and OSticket but we ran a scan with them turned off and we still failed. (The listed failures are strictly for my office and not the second location.)\n\nMy first plan has been to set up two PFSense firewalls containing our out of data VPN in a form of a DMZ so that the external scan would not see the issues. But learning the software has been a bit of a hurtle. I'm sure with time I will get the hang of it but for now, I just wanted to make sure I am not wasting my time. \n\nAs far as Windows vulnerabilities I always make sure all workstations are all updated, and I am always up to date on infosec twitter to make sure none of our customers/office has any open 0days. I considered myself pretty technical but these vulnerabilities have been kicking my ass so any input would be greatly appreciated. If anybody needs any more information let me know.\n\nThanks again.

            "selftext": "Hi, I'm looking for opinions on two parts of this design. We are doing a new install of Nexus 9300 and FEXs, we choose 93180LC-EX  and Nexus 2348TQ , after looking [into this](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus9000/hw/interoperability/fexmatrix/fextables.html) apperantly all ports of the 93180LC-EX supports FEX connection, right? what do you think of it?  .    \n\nThe second issue , is the 200 meters  (656 feet) connection between the 9300s and the Nexus 7000 ,  in the nexus we have only 10gb interfaces, so we would need to use breakout cable 40GB->4x10GB . After looking into this all breakout cables have fixed length, and also the 10gb sfp fixed . So we would the breakout cable 40GB to  4x LC connection , and then on the nexus side we connect to the 10 gb sfp on the Nexus 7000. The 200 meters fibers are already in place, with LC connectors on both sides. \nWould this work? How would you go about this?.  \n\n[This is the Diagram](https://i.imgur.com/wmXndhz.png)\n\nSorry any grammar mistakes, English is not my 1st language \n\nThanks!",

After reading a lot of internet, I'm accepting this as Truth (evidently Comcast uses RIP to assign static IPs so there may be valid technical reasons to need to use their hardware) and trying to figure out how to shut off as much of the DPC3941B's functionality as possible and route it to our Meraki MX84. I'm hoping that someone already has a link to a how-to guide for this that I can follow from scratch. Where I'm at: I think I have all of the DPC3941B's firewalling/WiFi/etc. turned off.

Using Cisco Meraki for our appliances. I am a sole IT Guy hired with the knowledge that I am weak in networking for now. Thanks in advance.\n\nMy laptop(Windows 10) and many others on the network can connect just fine. I have a few devices, so far only Windows 7 devices and one Windows 8 device, that will connect to the network, but with limited access.\n\nThe W8 device \"takes longer than usual\" but eventually connects with limited. The W7 devices don't take long.  Sometimes the error symbol will go away, but if I try to open anything it comes back. I have also tried hardwiring to the network on one of the W7 and the W8 device to no avail. It also tries to reconnect at time, still to no avail, It's probably not be related, but Chrome ends up not responding on these computers now as well. I am just adding it because it is one of the things acting deifferently from the status quo.\n\nTroubleshooting:\nChecked ipconfig and they have proper subnet masks and IP addresses (No APIPA)\nUninstalled the hardware in device manager \nRemoved all known networks\nDownloaded updated drivers from mfr \nTried these commands although after a little research(obviously didn't work):\n\nnetsh winsock reset\nnetsh int ip reset\nipcofig /renew\nipconfig/flushdns\n\nAny ideas?",

Even though the main site has a 50Mbps circuit, it could easily saturate one of the smaller sites' links just by virtue of not knowing the size of the remote circuits.\n\nThe way I've been handling this is by using a multi-tiered policy that has class-maps (Cisco equipment, btw) for each IP range of each site, and then a shaper that trims down outgoing traffic according to the link size of the remote site. The main policy-map then judges the traffic according to DSCP marking within each remote site's queue.\n\nMy solution seems to be working OK, but I'd imagine this would get unsustainable for a network with hundreds or thousands of sites. I also seem to run into the site-based shapers more often than I would expect, and they seem to activate even when there's not the full load of the remote site's circuit coming through. This could be burst related, but I was mostly just wondering what the industry standard is for this.",

R1 sends traffic there and R2 then forwards back to R1 via direct link.\n\nWe have had quite a bit of trouble with the internal OSPF / BGP peering with provider to provide backup routes to the other internal sites.  \n\nThe questions I have:\n* Is it possible (or recommended) to have R2 **only** advertise the the R3 routes into BGP if it learned those routes directly from R3?  (This would also be problematic if the R1 MPLS connection went down and the R3 -> R2 connection went down. R2 wouldn't advertise R3 routes even though it has a backup route via internal OSPF. \n\n* Are we going about this the right way? We can't really change the BGP with provider side of things but is OSPF the right choice for internal routing? Should we look into different protocols to achieve the proper redundancy with the other location advertising backup routes as well as the primary connection?",

So far this doesn't seem to work. \n\nI'm wondering if there's some way to reliably check that I'm configuring this right.

            "selftext": "I will try and keep this explanation simple, and if this is a terrible idea or if there is a better way to implement let me know.\n\nWhat I want to do is use a router, managed switch and 19 WAPs to create what effectively will be 18 discrete private networks in which devices can communicate with each other on their own network only and one public guest network which no device can communicate with another on this public network.  \n\nAll 19 WAPs will have an SSID called \"guestwifi\" and devices should be able to join and roam amongst all WAPs and be completely private to any other devices.  \n\n18 of the 19 WAPs will each have a discrete SSID called \"private 1\", \"private 2\", ... \"private 18\".  Devices connected to a specific SSID can communicate with each other like any standard private network, but cannot see device on any of the other 17 private networks or on the public \"guestwifi\".  \n\nSo far I think this is pretty feasible with VLAN tagging (wireless).  \n\nNow to throw a wrench in it, I would also like to have any wired device on the same physical port as one of the WAPs to be able to communicate with wireless devices on the private SSID, but again not with any devices on the public SSID or any devices on any other physical port (except the router) or any other private SSID.  \n\nExample here is a WAP that has two ethernet ports.  I want to have wired traffic from the second ethernet port (the one not connected to managed switch) to access devices on the \"private 1\" SSID but not any other SSID.  \n\nDoes this require a WAP that can do VLAN tagging per port on its ports or is this something that can be done at the main switch?  Can you segregate WAP management traffic from \"private 1\" traffic AND port 2 wired traffic? \n\nLooking at Ruckus R510 and trying to avoid a ZD if possible.  Can a R510 and managed switch and router that supports VLAN tagging accomplish the above?",

            "selftext": "Howdy all, hopefully I can explain this and make sense, so here goes.  We have a Cisco 3650 we are using for converged access wireless to control the AP's we are using for our separate guest wireless network.  The only connectivity this switch has to our internal network is through the Management interface (gi0/0) which is in the separate Mgmt-vrf so that we can manage it, monitor it, use aaa, etc.\n\nWe also have a home grown system that monitors snmp traps for mac add / remove notifications on all of our access switches.  Think a poor man's NAC, minus the control part.  \n\nToday, we got an alert from this system from the switch that the management port of our 3650 is connected to with a mac address the system didn't recognize.  It appeared and disappeared relatively quickly.  Upon further investigation, I found the mac address was actually a wireless client that was connected to one of the AP's controlled by the controller.\n\nI've never seen this kind of behavior, and so far I haven't been able to find any published bugs or anything either that match the symptoms I saw.\n\nI'm curious if any of you guys have seen or heard of anything like this.\n\nThanks!",

            "selftext": "Hello r/Networking\n\nOn top of my normal day job in IT (more on the server administration side than networking, but I know enough to know what I don't know) I'm helping out a friend\u2019s start-up to run a couple of bigger LAN tournaments in the coming months. My main question to you guys is, what am I forgetting? We don\u2019t have our venues finalized, but I\u2019m assuming that each will have adequate bandwidth and an accessible Ethernet port along with a backup wireless network(assuming the venue has one), although I\u2019d prefer all users to be connected via Ethernet. \n\nWe currently are planning on having up to 24 teams, all playing League of Legends, so around a maximum of 120 users/players at our events, most likely will be less. I've only really attended one other LAN similar to the one we're planning as an observer to see how it was run and how the network was set up. At this particular venue they had a dedicated Ethernet port at each table (1 tabler per team, so 5 users per table), along with an unmanaged 8-port switch + Ethernet cables for the computers. If our venues have that, great! It makes my job much easier. However if they don\u2019t, I will be forced to daisy chain together switches from table to table via Ethernet. I don\u2019t plan on relying on any venue\u2019s wireless network as players may not want to deal with latency/drops. I\u2019m planning to have a handful of Ethernet-to-USB adapters for users to borrow if their laptops don\u2019t have an Ethernet port. \n\nIf I am daisy chaining together a network of 8 port switches from table to table, should I invest in a managed 24 port+ switch to manage bandwidth to each user, or would this only be necessary if the venue has limited bandwidth in the first place. I assume I wouldn't want to limit bandwidth by port, as it would get lower and lower down the line... \n\nHere\u2019s my list of equipment from amazon, none of this stuff is finalized so if anyone has any suggestions I\u2019ll be happy to hear it. http://a.co/fQpMx1s\n\nDoes anyone think I\u2019m forgetting something?\n\nThanks!\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the help so far everyone! Working with Networking has always been intimidating to me, which is why I tended to stay more on the systems side. Looking forward to getting this underway and learning as it goes!",

            "selftext": "I recently came into a new position where the parent company I work for has a majority share in a number of sub-companies. Half of these sub-companies share the same physical office building and or suites but are logically separate entities. I have been in the Cisco channel partner environment for some time and before this position worked with a heavily PCI regulated company. I am aware of methods to VRF off traffic and terminate egress connections outside of the VRF against a firewall for segmentation (where my first thought went with this new position) but I'm not operating with the same budget. These sub-companies could effectively only have a handful of users, instead of hundreds, and some don't need a full suite of services (AD, DNS, ADFS, File/Print, etc..). \n\nAll of this said, I am considering the following and wanted to get some feedback from the group. I believe the following would work. \n\n1. Preset buckets of services (service set A, B, C) hosted within a hyper-converged small footprint server such as Nutanix or the like.\n2. Network layer segmentation via VRF lite\n3. Multi-context firewall or simple routed mode on the ASA (only caveat is shared routing table close to the edge towards the shared Internet connection)\n4. Wireless connectivity terminate separate SSIDs with corresponding separate physical or logical tagged interfaces in the respective VLAN/VRF.\n5. Voice? Not sure how to handle this one..\n\nThe solution above is mostly based on using what I know, which is most all Cisco and ESXi. I've considered Meraki but the deep level of network segmentation IMO required keeps pulling back to Cisco outside of wireless. With cost always an issue and charge back intentions to the tenants potentially I'm looking to keep the CAPEX to a minimum. Any thoughts? Thanks.\n\nEDIT: Thinking through this a bit more. Wondering if with the use of L2 VLANs with the SVI residing on a trunked sub-interface of an ASA firewall would be a cheaper option and provide L3 separation. Of course there would have to be tight controls over VLAN membership on the switchgear and port access in the IDF network closet.\n",

What I am trying to find out, is if/how I can :\n\nConfigure a floating static route if an OSPF peer drops, route traffic through my firewall. \n\n\nThe use case here is that I want to be able to route traffic through an IPSEC tunnel backup route, but according to the NOS configuration guide, you cannot configure a floating static route as you would in Cisco-land. You can change the admin distance of static routes as a whole, but not individually. This poses problems with our current architecture. \n\nSimple features like a floating static route seem like it would be a \"given\", especially since brocade Fast iron seems to have the capability to do this. \n\nBefore I reach out to brocade (I mean Extreme), I wanted to ask here first if anyone has any experience with this with a VDX fabric.  .\n\nThanks!",

I sort of have an idea but want some feedback on the correct/better approach, and one with minimal outage.\n\nCurrently there are two separate networks (refer current image) and R1 and R3 are in ospf area 0, with a static route between the two.\n\n(refer to end state image). Need to have R1 and R3 peer with each other and be in area 0. R3's current area 0 along with its peer's needs to be converted to a non-backbone area 3. \n\nMy idea is to create a different ospf process on R3 for area 0 then peer with R1.  Redistribute between the two ospf processes on R3 (so downstream routers example R2 will continue to have connectivity to R4 etc). Then covert the link between R3 and R2 to the new ospf process in area 3. Then same thing for R4. \n\nWould this work? How would you do it? Looking for ideas or alternative solutions. Note: need to minimize any downtime as much as possible. ",

I have the WLC set up as the radius client with a shared secret.  i have network and connection policies set up with the cert (and it has a subject, not blank).  my connection policy is set up with PEAP and to override the network policy for authentication.\n\nI seem to have something wrong with the setup because i have three different outcomes happening.  \n\n\nScenario 1 - i have a macbook pro, that i finally got to connect.  the cert warning comes up and i accepted it and put in my domain username and password.   that works just fine.  in fact each subsequent connection doesnt require password (im guessing it's cached).  \n\nScenario 2 - My iphone doesnt even associate to the WLC and will deny connection automatcially.  i can tell because there are no logs in the NPS server for AUTH failures (something i would normally see)\n\nScenario 3 - My Windows 7 laptop will associate with the WLC, but fail auth on the NPS server with reason code 16, saying my username and password are incorrect (which is false, they are correct).   \n\n\nScenario 1 is ideal.  i just dont know what to do about the others.  i've read that it has to do with accepting the self - signed certs, but something i dont want to have to mess with as i want replicate BYOD scenarios.

We also created new network profiles when setting up this server, but I have restored to the working profiles from last year.  I tried 20 vs. 40 GHz spectrums to see if one was more reliable.

I am trying to configure this to grab its DHCP from the outside interface, currently the outside interface gets its ip address through dhcp and it works fine. The problem is that the inside interface creates its own pool of ip addresses when configured through the startup wizard. This is my first experience configuring a cisco firewall of any sort so i am ultra confused, for me to login to the ASDM management interface i have to use 2 ports on my cisco sf 300-08, one to connect to the inside interface on the ASA and the other  is plugged into the management interface on the ASA. When i try to reconfigure the \"inside\" interface to not be a dhcp server it does not work, it just drops the connection to the ASDM and i lose connectivity and have to hard reset the ASA, how am i going to configure the \"inside\" interface to pass out dhcp from the \"outside\" interface if the ASA requires 2 connections from my switch. The reason that i have this particular setup is because i am getting a dhcp pool from a configured vlan within the building i operate out of, it s a class A 10.10.x.x address. I just want to have the \"inside\" interface that the switch is plugged into pick up its ip address from the \"outside\" interface and start passing the same range of addresses to all the devices plugged into my switch.

I connect to an AP that's associated with it no problem and have Internet access, but then when I try to access the webUI, I immediately get greeted by an error message saying that the IP address of the MGMT interface sent no data. I've mirrored the configs of other WLCs (2504s, not 5520s) and have never had a problem with this. I can connect to the webUI no problem when I'm connected to another AP using another WLC, or a phone hotspot. Has anyone else ever ran into something similar and know what's causing it or what a fix is? Thanks!\n",

Since the container are coming and going all the time on various hosts, with different IPs, trying to derive policy from traffic is never going to produce anything useful.

            "selftext": "Hi all. We're in the process of migrating from a pair of ASA 5545 to a pair of FortiGate 600D. It's been a couple of years since I've worked with FortiGate and my networking is a bit rusty, so I apologize if these seem like dumb questions. Hoping you guys can help me out!  \n\n* My first question is in regards to routing. Our ASAs run EIGRP. On the ASAs, we have several static routes that automatically appear in the EIGRP routing table, which are then are shared with the rest of the network (all Cisco, all EIGRP). Our existing ASAs and our new FortiGates connect directly with our core, which runs both OSPF and EIGRP. They are being redistributed into each other. \nOur FortiGate runs OSPF. If we create static routes on the FortiGate, are those static routes automatically added into the OSPF routing table like they are on the ASAs, and is that OSPF routing table then shared with the rest of our network? If not, how can we get our static routes into the OSPF routing table? \nThe reason I ask is that we weren't seeing any directly-connected networks from the FortiGate in the routing table of our core. The FortiGate was seeing advertised routes from the core, but the core was not seeing advertised routes from the FortiGate. I'm a little confused about that.  \n\n* Next, on the FortiGate, we have our physical interfaces (Outside, Inside), and several virtual VLAN interfaces beneath the physical Inside interface (VLAN 201, 202, etc). If I create a policy and apply it to the physical Inside interface, for example, will that policy automatically apply to all VLANs beneath that interface? Or do I have to explicitly select all VLAN interfaces? Just want to make sure I understand this correctly as this could affect the way our policies are written.  \n\n* This might sound dumb, but do policies work in both directions? For example, if I allow traffic from outside to an internal web server, does that automatically mean traffic will work in the opposite direction as well?  \n\n* Lastly, on the Policy screen, when creating a new policy, how does the NAT feature there work? How does that differ from VIPs? This was explained to us once before, but I\u2019m still a little unclear. We have several web servers that should NAT from external (199.X.X.X) to internal (10.X.X.X) and vice-versa. Would a VIP or a NAT be a better way to achieve this?  \n\nAgain, sorry if these seem like dumb questions. I'd really appreciate any input you all may have. Thanks in advance!",

I have been tasked with migrating the east-west traffic between locations away from traditional MPLS and IPSec tunnels and implementing an SD-WAN architecture that leverages only DIA circuits.\n\nI have been speaking with SD-WAN vendors such as SilverPeak and Talari to achieve this using their appliances. These solutions seem great, but I also wanted to check out some open source options as the organization happily embraces all things open source as we leverage a lot of Linux-based solutions. This research led me to OpenStack. Specifically Neutron coupled with plugins such as OpenContrail or OpenDaylight.\n\nHas anyone here explored this sort of approach to SD-WAN? I'm extremely interested in learning if this is a viable method of accomplishing the goal of SD-WAN which, to me, is a focus around path selection based on link quality between source and destination. \n\nAny thoughts or idea are more than welcome!\n/Eusono",

Even after opening up the security policies to allow any-to-any traffic flow, I still cannot ping/curl/ftp/rdp any resources on the remote sides of the tunnels.\n\nFor simplicity's sake, this diagram highlights the issue between two firewalls:\n\n    [site1]====(vpn)====[site2]\n    [vpn]               [vpn]\n    [st0.2]             [st0.1]\n    [users]             [users]\n    [10.1.0.0/24]       [10.2.0.0/24]\n\nsome basics on the zones and policies\n\nfirewall | interface | zone | ip address\n---------|----------|----------|----------\nsite1 | ge-0/0/0.0 | internet | 74.51.192.11\nsite1 | st0.2 | vpn | 169.254.12.11/24\nsite1 | ge-0/0/1.0 | users | 10.1.0.1/24\nsite2 | ge-0/0/0.0 | internet | 74.51.192.22\nsite2 | st0.1 | vpn | 169.254.12.22/24\nsite2 | ge-0/0/1.0 | users | 10.2.0.1/24\n\nI'll spare you all from the ike and ipsec policies because, as I mentioned earlier, the tunnels are up and healthy. \n(BTW, MTU and TCP MSS have been dropped accordingly to match MTU setting of 1500)\n\n**mirrored on site2-fw1**\n\n    root@site-fw1# run show security ipsec security-associations \n    Total active tunnels: 1\n    ID    Algorithm       SPI      Life:sec/kb  Mon lsys Port  Gateway   \n    <131073 ESP:aes-cbc-256/sha256 2ed5b06f 34863/unlim U root 500 74.51.192.22    \n    >131073 ESP:aes-cbc-256/sha256 130baebb 34863/unlim U root 500 74.51.192.22    \n\nfor the sake of simplicity, static routes are pointing to the respective tunnel interface\n\n    set interfaces st0.2 family inet address 169.254.12.11/24\n    set routing-options static route 10.2.0.0/16 next-hop st0.2\n\n    root@site1-fw1# run show route protocol static \n    inet.0: 16 destinations, 16 routes (16 active, 0 holddown, 0 hidden)\n    + = Active Route, - = Last Active, * = Both\n    10.2.0.0/16        *[Static/5] 00:19:48 > to 169.254.12.22 via st0.2\n\n**mirrored on site2-fw1**\n\nNow that I've shown the health of the tunnels and their routing table, let me poke holes at where I think my problem is: security policies.

If the ONT is ready to send something but it's not yet its \"turn\", how long does it have to wait worst-case? Milliseconds, microseconds...?\n* Does the upstream latency vary with factors such as number of subscribers/amount of upstream activity on other subscribers' lines?

(My assumption is no.)\n\nMany thanks to anyone who can answer any of these. I hope this doesn't fall afoul of the rules.

routing-options static route 0.0.0.0/0 next-hop 10.20.2.1\n    set interfaces ge-0/0/0 unit 0 family inet address 10.20.2.211/24\n    \nMost of my interfaces are connecting to trunk ports to make life easier so I'm going to enable vlan tagging and use subinterfaces to connect to everything.\n\n    set interfaces ge-0/0/1 vlan-tagging\n    set interfaces ge-0/0/1 unit 3011 vlan-id 3011\n    set interfaces ge-0/0/1 unit 3011 family inet address 10.1.11.1/24\n    set interfaces ge-0/0/1 unit 3012 vlan-id 3012\n    set interfaces ge-0/0/1 unit 3012 family inet address 10.1.2.1/24\n    set interfaces ge-0/0/1 unit 3013 vlan-id 3013\n    set interfaces ge-0/0/1 unit 3013 family inet address 10.1.3.1/24\n    set interfaces ge-0/0/1 unit 3014 vlan-id 3014\n    set interfaces ge-0/0/1 unit 3014 family inet address 10.1.4.1/24\n    set interfaces lo0 unit 0 family inet address 192.168.255.1/32\n\n\nThen I'll just turn on OSPF on all active interfaces in the routing instance.\n\n    root@P01# set protocols ospf area 0.0.0.0 interface all \n\nOnce we are done we should see a neighbor with every other P router and a PE router (once we get that far)\n\n    root@P01# run show ospf neighbor \n    Address          Interface              State     ID               Pri  Dead\n    10.1.11.254      ge-0/0/1.3011          Full      192.168.255.11   128    39\n    10.1.2.2

192.168.255.4    128    34\n    \n\n###Enabling MPLS\n\nWhile Cisco put effort into making sure MPLS is turned on right away, Juniper takes a bit more effort. \n\nFirst we need to enable MPLS and LDP in the control plane under protocols, we can conveniently use the interface all keyword to enable it on all interfaces.\n\n    root@P01# set protocols mpls interface all \n    \n    root@P01# set protocols ldp interface all   \n\nNext we need to turn it on for the forwarding plane by adding the mpls family to each interface on the router that will be in the MPLS path.\nThis can be a bit annoying so you might want to look into things like config groups to ease the admin burden.\n\n\n    set interfaces ge-0/0/1 unit 3011 family mpls\n    \n    set interfaces ge-0/0/1 unit 3012 family mpls\n    \n    set interfaces ge-0/0/1 unit 3013 family mpls\n    \n    set interfaces ge-0/0/1 unit 3014 family mpls\n    \n    set interfaces lo0 unit 0 family mpls\n\n\n#Route Reflector\n\nWe'll use a route reflector again but this time I'm just take advantage of the logical-system feature to carve PE01 and PE02 into two new Route Reflector boxes.\n\n###RR01\n\nFirst we'll turn on vlan-tagging for the interface I want to use since we still need to configure physical stuff at the interface level in logical-systems.\n\n    root@PE11# set interfaces ge-0/0/2 vlan-tagging \n    \nNext we configure the interfaces like above under the logical-system.\n\n    root@PE11# set logical-systems RR01 interfaces ge-0/0/2 unit 3123 vlan-id 3123 \n    root@PE11# set logical-systems RR01 interfaces ge-0/0/2 unit 3123 family inet address 10.0.123.254/24 \n    root@PE11# set logical-systems RR01 interfaces ge-0/0/2 unit 3123 family mpls \n    root@PE11# set logical-systems RR01

mpls interface all \n    root@PE11# set logical-systems RR01 protocols ldp interface all \n    \nBGP is configured with the `inet-vpn` family which is the same as Cisco's VPNv4 family, the route reflector will have all for PEs as a peer, will use 65123 as the AS for iBGP and will set a cluster-id so Juniper knows it is a Route Reflector.\n\n    root@PE11# set logical-systems RR01 protocols

last piece of the L3VPN and which is making the policies as well as the VRF the CE goes into.\n\n###Policies\n\nIn Cisco land we controlled what route we imported and exported under the VRF configuration, Juniper does that too but for more granular control we will make a more elaborate policy.\n\nFirst we make an community policy that just exports the PE's RD on each router.\n\n    root@PE11# set policy-options community RT-EXPORT-CE01 members target:65123:101 \n\nNext we'll do the same for the import community where we will make one for each CE for flexibility's sake.\n\n    root@PE11# set policy-options community RT-IMPORT-CE01 members target:65123:101 \n    root@PE11# set policy-options community RT-IMPORT-CE02 members target:65123:102 \n    root@PE11# set policy-options community RT-IMPORT-CE03 members target:65123:103 \n    root@PE11# set policy-options community RT-IMPORT-CE04 members target:65123:104\n\nWith that in place we make a policy that will become our VRF-Export policy, we will say that if the protocol is directly connected or one of the routing protocols then we will add the export community and accept the route.\n\n    root@PE11# set policy-options policy-statement EXPORT-CE01 term EXPORT from protocol [ direct bgp rip ospf ]\n    root@PE11# set policy-options policy-statement EXPORT-CE01 term EXPORT then community add RT-EXPORT-CE01 \n    root@PE11# set policy-options policy-statement EXPORT-CE01 term EXPORT then accept \n\nIf it doesn't match that criteria then we will reject it.\n\n    root@PE11# set policy-options policy-statement EXPORT-CE01 term REJECT then reject \n\nThe VRF-Import policy will always be from MBGP so we match on protocol BGP, then we select what communities we want to talk to each other. \n\nIn our topology Cust-A is CE01 and CE02 so we'll do that then reject the rest.\n\n    root@PE11# set policy-options policy-statement IMPORT-CE01 term IMPORT from protocol bgp \n    root@PE11# set policy-options policy-statement IMPORT-CE01 term IMPORT from community [ RT-IMPORT-CE01 RT-IMPORT-CE02 ] \n    root@PE11# set policy-options policy-statement IMPORT-CE01 term IMPORT then accept \n    root@PE11# set policy-options policy-statement IMPORT-CE01 term REJECT then reject\n\n###VRFs\n\nWith all that in place we need to make a VRF instance. In my case I'm using ge-0/0/5 on all the PEs as the CE interface so we add it to the VRF, we also set the PE's proper RD and apply the VRF policies we just made. We also use `vrf-table-label` to help make the L3VPN happy.\n\n    root@PE11# set routing-instances CE01 instance-type vrf \n    root@PE11# set routing-instances CE01 interface ge-0/0/5.0 \n    root@PE11# set routing-instances CE01 route-distinguisher 65123:101 \n    root@PE11# set routing-instances CE01 vrf-import IMPORT-CE01 \n    root@PE11# set routing-instances CE01 vrf-export EXPORT-CE01 \n    root@PE11# set routing-instances CE01 vrf-table-label \n\nWe'll also set the router-id for the instance just to have a bit more control\n\n    root@PE11# set routing-instances CE01 routing-options router-id 192.168.255.11 \n\n#Customer Edge\n\n###PE01\n\nFinally we will start working on the CE routing!\n\nWe need an export policy so Juniper knows what to send so I'll make a simple one that just accepts any route, since PE01 is BGP we'll setup that too. The config is the same as you have seen though you may want to use the as-override option if you are using BGP.\n\n    root@PE11# set policy-options policy-statement EXPORT-BGP then accept\n    root@PE11# set routing-instances CE01 protocols bgp group CUST-A type external \n    root@PE11# set routing-instances CE01 protocols bgp group CUST-A export EXPORT-BGP \n    root@PE11# set routing-instances CE01 protocols bgp group CUST-A peer-as 65101 \n    root@PE11# set routing-instances CE01 protocols bgp group CUST-A neighbor 192.168.1.1 as-override \n    \n\n\n    root@PE11# set policy-options policy-statement EXPORT-BGP then accept \n\n    root@PE11# set policy-options policy-statement EXPORT-OSPF from protocol bgp \n    root@PE11# set policy-options policy-statement EXPORT-OSPF then accept\n    root@PE11# set policy-options policy-statement EXPORT-RIP then metric 5 \n    root@PE11# set policy-options policy-statement EXPORT-RIP then accept \n \n\n###CE01, CE02, CE03, CE04\n\nSince the CE's are still in flow mode, we need to make sure the interfaces we use are trusted by the security zone, we could get more specific but we aren't really playing with the firewall today :) \n\n\n    root@CE01# set security zones security-zone trust host-inbound-traffic system-services all \n    root@CE01# set security zones security-zone trust host-inbound-traffic protocols all \n    root@CE01# set security zones security-zone trust interfaces ge-0/0/1.0 \n    root@CE01# set security zones security-zone trust interfaces ge-0/0/2.0 \n    \n\n###CE01\n\nFor BGP we just do a normal peering and advertise everything directly connected.\n\n    \n    root@CE01# set policy-options policy-statement EXPORT-BGP from protocol direct \n    root@CE01# set policy-options policy-statement EXPORT-BGP then accept\n    \n    root@CE01# set protocols bgp group CUST-A type external \n    root@CE01# set protocols bgp group CUST-A export EXPORT-BGP \n    root@CE01# set protocols bgp group CUST-A peer-as 65123 \n    root@CE01# set protocols bgp group CUST-A neighbor 192.168.1.254 \n    \n    \n###CE02 \n\nSame with RIP for CE02\n\n    root@CE02# set policy-options policy-statement EXPORT-RIP from protocol direct \n    root@CE02# set policy-options policy-statement EXPORT-RIP then accept\n    \n    root@CE02# set protocols rip group CUST-A export EXPORT-RIP \n    root@CE02# set protocols rip group CUST-A neighbor ge-0/0/1.0 \n\n\n###CE03 and CE04\n\nThe OSPF CE is a bit unique because it is the only protocol we are looking at today that cares about external routes. Let's setup OSPF in two ways, one will simply add all interfaces to OSPF and the other will use the export method we have been doing\n\n\n    root@CE03# set protocols ospf area 0.0.0.0 interface all \n    root@CE03# set protocols ospf area 0.0.0.0 interface lo0.0 passive \n\n\n    root@CE04# set policy-options policy-statement EXPORT-OSPF from protocol direct \n    root@CE04# set policy-options policy-statement EXPORT-OSPF then accept \n    root@CE04# set protocols ospf export EXPORT-OSPF    \n    root@CE04# set protocols ospf area 0.0.0.0 interface ge-0/0/1.0 \n\n\nNow we get the routes but routes from CE04 are external!

All it says on the orange jacketing is this:\n\nBERK-TEK OPTICAL FIBER CABLE - PDP024-012LB/75-012AB - PLENUM - GIGAlite - TYPE OFNP (UL) - OFN-FT6 c(UL) - 75C 07/05  [SM - BLUE W/HASHMARK]  008926 FEET\n\nDoesn't say anything about 50 or 62.5 or OM1 or 2 etc. \n\n[Pic of fiber here](https://i.imgur.com/gPVgrFm.jpg)\n\nAny help is greatly appreciated! Thanks\n\n\nEDIT: Thank you all for helping me solve this mystery. Shoutout to /u/Rad10Ka0s for finding these details! It's a hybrid cable with 12 strands of single mode and 12 strands of multimode 50um fiber. Turns out the multimode is what's patched into my current environment. \n\n\nPDP = Premise Distribution Plenum, 024 = 24 strand.\n\nLB = proprietary \"Gigalite\" standard ~ 50um, OM2. Multimode.\n\nAB = OS2 9.2um Single mode.\n\n\nAlso thanks to /u/417SKCFAN for helping me quickly identify that the fiber patch panels are indeed using the multimode fiber. ",

Conversely I've seen <10% retries in those times as well.\n* I haven't seen any clear patterns as to when or where the problem will happen. It's in different rooms / schools / areas day to day.\n\n**Examples - Happening right now**    \n\n* Channel 140, 18dBm EIRP, noise floor -97dBm, channel quality 79, 9 associated clients, no interference. 2% retried frames to client, 21% retried frames from client\n* Channel 116, 18dBm EIRP, noise floor -88dBm, channel quality 89, 25 associated clients, no interference. 3% retried frames to client, 21% retried frames from client\n\n**I've looked at the usual suspects for excessive retries**    \n\n* Non-802.11 RF interference - Very low interference reported by controller and no reason to suspect any sources of interference. All Chromebooks are on 5Ghz--2.4Ghz is exclusively guest use\n* Co-channel interference - Verified on-site with survey app, there are no nearby APs on the same channel\n* Adjacent channel interference - No channels overlapping either\n* Low SNR - All clients always report excellent SNR (>25dBm and frequently as high as 50dBm)\n* Mismatched power - AFAIK ~13.5dBm txpower is appropriate -- may need tweaking?\n* Hidden node - I suspected this at first, but I've disabled low data rates and turned down txpower, and in most examples I've seen the associated client count matches the number of devices in the classroom with the AP\n* DRS - All clients report either highest or second-highest possible MCS index in all examples I've seen\n* I've taken pcaps remotely from the APs and not seen anything obviously wrong, other than excessive retries. But honestly I'm not strong in pcap analysis so I could easily be missing something.\n\n**Next steps**    \n\nI'm thinking about doing an independent pcap from my laptop and saving a bunch of them for later analysis. The pcaps I took before were all from the APs, so I wonder if my device will pick something up the AP didn't. But this is hard, because I can't predict when and where the next issue will happen.

Currently running about 50 APs, although as is, the network should have about 25 more APs than it has now. You could strain spaghetti through it today. If I go with Cisco, I'm looking at approximately 100 APs after expansion, and about 5 SSIDs with various configs for different purposes, some on different VLANs.\n\nI have strong background in both cisco and ruckus. I've worked on dozens of cisco wlans and I designed and installed both cisco and ruckus networks over the last 7-8 years. I really like both for various reasons.\n\nThat said, we have a pretty ugly RF environment, lots of random and inexplicable dead spots (where they really don't make sense) and a pretty steel heavy construction in new construction areas, and some older office areas are still plaster and chicken wire. In my experience, Ruckus wins on range and dealing with RF noise, so this feels like my logical choice. Not to mention that the R710 is a monster of an AP and would cut my AP count dramatically over cisco APs.\n\nExcept for all the mud surrounding their sale-resale mess.\n\nCombine this with the fact that for the entirety of their existence, Ruckus has just sucked at firmware for some reason, this feels like a potential disaster.\n\nYou know the old saying, nobody ever got fired for installing Cisco.\n\nAnyone have anything to add, to possibly help me clarify my thoughts here?",

It's the aftermath i'm still dealing with.\n\nSince that moment, there are a few clients on the network that can't access certain other resources.\n\nclients:\n\n* client A,B and C are in vlan A\n* client D is in vlan B\n\nresources:\n\n* Resource A, B and C are in vlan C\n* Resource D and E are in vlan D\n* Resource F is in vlan E\n\nsituation:\n\n* Client A can access everything\n* Client B cannot access Resources A and D but can access all other resources\n* Client C cannot access Resources B and C but can access all other resources\n* Client D cannot access Resource C but can access all other resources\n\nWhen i relocate clients B and C into another vlan (say F) they can access everything\nI then gave client B a new (previously unused) ip adres in vlan A and it could access Resources A and B, but not F anymore\ni then gave client B the ip address of client C and it got the situation of client C\n\nThat seems to me like the issue is ip address based, but it's not actually the routing for entire networks, just parts.\n\nwhen i traceroute i always get to the coreswitch that should route it. I also haven't gotten problems with clients not getting to resources in their own vlan\n\nSo i'm afraid the core switch isn't routing properly for parts of a network, if that is possible?\n\nThe part of me that is a windows admin (small bussiness, i need to do everything) wants to do a reboot of the core but ... that would bring the entire network and servers down (only 1 core, vmware servers and storage are connected through the core) so that's not that easy to do (also 24/7 bussiness)\n\nI know the layout of the network isn't good and needs to change. I'm not saying that it is just what i need to work with because of budget and time ... but it is _for now_ until i get the money and time to change it. So please don't get hung up on that.",

Cisco recommend a minimum of 3 APIC Server?\n    - Is this per site or possible to have distributive setup which installed on different site?\n    -\"We only allow a single APIC in lab/test environments where redundancy is not required.\" So meaning you can still use a single server to control the devices?\n      But in this statement\n     \"When the connection between two sites is lost, the site with one APIC controller will be in the minority (site 2 in the figure above). When a controller is in the minority, it cannot be the leader for any shards. This limits the controller in site 2 to read only operations; administrators cannot make any configuration changes through the controller in site 2\"\n \nSo meaning I cannot use a singe APIC server to control the infrastructure?\n \n\n\n2.

The /24 in question wouldn't have a route to the firewalls - so no traffic would ever get there - rules out some odd internet forwarding issue.\n\nCustomers with lease like connections should be fine.  Customers with vpn tunnels to us - maybe?

I can ping 10.40.254.1 fine from the router, but not from my workstation that has a 10.33.0.0 IP.\n\nWhat am I doing wrong?\n\nAdditional info ...\n\n10.40.0.0 is vlan 400\n\n10.254.0.0 is vlan 254\n\n10.33.0.0 is vlan 963\n\nMuch thanks for any help with this.\n\nI can provide additional information on this if needed.\n\n",

According to him, they have a free trial of their service, which includes $3000+ of routing and switching equipment and 3 years of their Meraki service. After looking into it further, I discovered that the equipment includes modern, up-to-date APs routers, and switches, all of which are managed via cloud-based services, and it includes 3 years of their premium Meraki management service. In my opinion, this would be very useful for small businesses and agencies, but it would be under-performing for larger corporations. According to various customers, they have very mixed reviews. On one end of the spectrum, they glorify Meraki for its simple configuration, easy-to-use UI/UX, fast updates, and its ease of use. On the other end, they criticize Meraki heavily for lack of complex mobility, application management, field service, and complex use. Furthermore, they do not like internal components being configured externally, and the APs have low ranges. Some reviews claimed these lack of features exist to prevent Meraki from competing with Cisco Enterprise. I understand both the appeals and criticisms of Cisco Meraki, but given how mixed the opinions are on the topic, I was wanting to know your opinions on Cisco Meraki.

The issue at hand is there has been packet loss crossing between vlans, but no packet loss as long as you are accessing systems within your own subnet/vlan. \n\nWireshark shows that there are tons of arp broadcasts. Each broadcast is like a few milliseconds apart. I don't see that there are responses to these requests. I'm thinking there might be a switching loop on the network but am not certain. The mac address table shows a bunch of entries for that specific VLAN. The particular connection is on a LAG with 2 fiber ports on each end configured as a trunk. There is another Dell PowerConnect that it connects to on the other side of the building. I double checked the configuration on the switches and it looks good. Any suggestions or similar experiences? Does anyone know if the individual ports need to be set as trunks as well even though the port channel is set as trunk? They are individually set as access ports, but I don' t know if the switch ignores the individual settings for the ports once they are set as link aggregated group. Thanks in advance.",

Now they have a lab running and showed my colleagues NSX.\n\nAnd of course ~\"you don't need a F5 load balancer any longer, if you buy NSX\" as NSX includes a load balancer => What?\n\nOnly weeks ago I was listening to some other colleagues which received a quote for KEMP load balancer for their VDI Horizon view project. The quote was from the same seller.\n\nI'm the network guy by the way. But no one wants to believe me when I say something. \"We have a firewall and for that 2x2 web servers for VMware VDI you do not need KEMP\" We can do it without buying additional xxxxx $ KEMP software. \"But cosultant X recommends it for better Performance\" \n\"If he says you should jump from the bridge, do you jump, then?\" (Well I didn't say that to my colleagues) But they really/do buy everything that seller throws at them without asking. Am I the only person which is in such a situation???\n\nBack to topic: \"NSX can completely replace F5 load balancer\"\n\nI was looking for a comparison sheet: F5 versus NSX load balancer. Something official from F5 would be nice.\n\n(Blog posts/personal opinions are worthless in that world I'm living in. But \"vendor > seller\" will work)\n\nI have found many links talking about NSX load balancer solely or even KEMP versus F5, but I need something with NSX + F5.

There's a management vrf and the default vrf.\n\nSwitchA VLAN 10 is 10.10.10.1/16\nSwitchB VLAN 10 is 10.10.10.2/16\nVRRP for VLAN 10 is 10.10.10.3/16\nSwitchA mgmt0 is 10.10.10.10\nSwitchB mgmt0 is 10.10.10.11\n\nFirewall at the internet edge is 10.10.10.254\n\nSwitchA and SwitchB have identical output for default route in vrf default:\n\n    sh ip route vrf default 0.0.0.0\n    IP Route Table for VRF \"default\"\n    '*' denotes best ucast next-hop\n    '**' denotes best mcast next-hop\n    '[x/y]' denotes [preference/metric]\n    '%<string>' in via output denotes VRF <string>\n\n    0.0.0.0/0, ubest/mbest: 2/0\n        *via 10.10.10.254, [1/0], 28w1d, static\n        *via 10.10.10.3%management, [1/0], 28w0d, static\n\nSwitchA and SwitchB have identical output for the default route in vrf management:\n\n    sh ip route vrf management 0.0.0.0\n    IP Route Table for VRF \"management\"\n    '*' denotes best ucast next-hop\n    '**' denotes best mcast next-hop\n    '[x/y]' denotes [preference/metric]\n    '%<string>' in via output denotes VRF <string>\n\n    0.0.0.0/0, ubest/mbest: 1/0\n        *via 10.10.10.3, [1/0], 28w0d, static\n\nThis is how I understand this would work:\nYou and your 20 friends are leaving a party.  When you go to leave the house, every other person goes out the front door.  The other 10 get sent to the basement.  In the basement, someone tells them that they need to go back upstairs, where they get in line to leave the house.  Back upstairs, every other person goes out the front door.  The other 5 get sent to the basement.  In the basement, someone tells them that they need to go back upstairs, where they get in line to leave the house.  Back upstairs, every other person goes out the front door.  The other 2 get sent to the basement.  In the basement, someone tells them that they need to go back upstairs, where they get in line to leave the house.  Back upstairs, every other person goes out the front door.  The other 1 gets sent to the basement.  In the basement, someone tells them that they need to go back upstairs, where they get in line to leave the house.  Back up stairs, the final person makes it out the door.  This is exasparated if more people show up and subsequently queue up to leave.\n\nSo, not exactly a loop, but am I missing something here, or should the default route in the default vrf to 10.10.10.3 be removed?\n\nCheers!\nbbak-- \n\"Edit: formating snippets\"",

            "selftext": "Recently I've become more intrigued at the concept of reducing the L2 domain as much as possible in the Enterprise and Data Center environment, while doing it in the least expensive way possible with commodity hardware. BGP Only / Clos designs seem to be the new hotness in the networking community, so I decided to give it a whirl to see exactly how flexible this design paradigm is. Here's the [Homelab Diagram](https://redd.it/70e4k0).\n\nThe general idea is that we can push the L2 to the TOR and control traffic flow from tier to tier (hop to hop) using BGP policies / communities. The idea is that any basic hardware supporting BGP should implement this basic functionality, and it is an Open Standard, so we can rely on Well Know features of BGP to implement policies. Routes can be managed by a centralized BGP route server / cluster that each node is peered with upon deployment, so beyond the initial deployment of devices / provisioning of end system networks, additional switch configuration during daily operations is minimal.\n\nThe concept I'm looking to test out is deploying a Clos / BGP only topology at the core with economical hardware, and then offering advanced services on an as-needed basis by deploying an \"advanced-services\" networking node. These will be used for things like EVPN and Multicast to stitch together the end-system L2 domains behind separate Leafs when needed. This node could be virtual (on a Hyp) or Physical, and will peer with the upstream Leaf switch via BGP. The traffic will appear to be standard IP Unicast to the main BGP / Clos topology, and the main devices will not need the hardware / software to support EVPN / VXLAN, etc. This will reduce CapEx by lowering the cost of the hardware that will need to be deployed at scale, and by making it easier to decide / isolate when advanced feature sets / licensing is necessary.\n\nThoughts?\n\n[RFC](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7938)\n\n[RFC TLDR](https://www.nanog.org/meetings/nanog55/presentations/Monday/Lapukhov.pdf)\t",

            "selftext": "UPDATE: TLDR; I'm an idiot. Thanks for the help\nSo it seems as though the problem was actually with the switch that I plugged into L3, the port wasn't configured as a trunk, which is why it was throwing an error about VLANs. Issue resolved, network connectivity looks good, but now it's slow as the dickens. I guess I'll go learn about port grouping for combining bandwidth?\n\nSetup: I work as an IT lab manager at my college. We have been allotted a portion of 10.2.196.0/24 with which to put our servers that host VMs for classes and such. Naturally, we are scarce on IP Addresses, so we ask the School's IT Dept for more addresses. He assigns us a /19 network to work with, great. The only problem is that we have to route all of that traffic through 10.2.196.254 (as per the firewall rule that the School IT Guy told us about). We have 1 Wall port that leads to 10.2.196.0/24 network. Easy enough, we set up a router with one port as 10.2.196.254 and the other as a gateway on 10.31.192.0/19. However, currently plugged into that port is the switches that are then plugged into our physical hosts, which are on the 10.2.196.0/24. \n\nMy thought was to instead of using a router which only has one 2 ports, use a L3 Switch and just plug the existing switch into that one via trunk, and plug L3 into wall via trunk, all is solved because existing switch can just trunk through to the router, it just has one additional hop, no big deal, and then I plug an additional network cable from each server into L3 with L3 VLAN interface being 10.31.192.0/19 gateway, and the default VLAN interface being 10.2.196.254 to act as gateway.\n\nFirst question, would that work the way that I described, i.e. all existing stuff on 10.2.196.0/24 can still get out, and all new VMs created on the 10.31.192.0/19 would also be able to get out (by out I mean through to 10.2.196.1 gateway, which connects to the rest of the college network and to the internet).\n\nNext problem, I get a Default VLAN mismatch error on L3 switch, indicating that college network switch which is connected to 10.2.196.1 (which is in the School networking closet, out of my control) is not using VLAN 1 as default. Is there a way I can see what VLAN it is using as default? I have used \n>sho cdp neighbor\n\n>sho ip interfaces trunk\n\nbut I'm not sure if I can see what the other switch is doing, except by asked the School IT Guy, but they don't really like to work with us.\n\nSorry if this is a dumb question or if I am just way out of my depth here. Obviously the biggest issue is the politics, but that's out of my control.\n",

            "selftext": "I know it's quite a provocative subject and I know MPLS is known as somewhat complicated here.\n\nBut let's say you have a network with few thousands of devices, how do you segment the network to have some security between the segments if not using MPLS?\n\nDo you have different VLANs and then let all the VLANs talk to each other via VLAN interfaces at the core/distribution level? Without limiting the traffic between VLANs at all.\n\nOr do you use VRF lite to restrict certain users to their own routing table and then have the exit point at the firewall? And have subinterfaces in the firewall and rules between network segments?\n\nOr... do you have users at a certain location sit behind a smaller FW and limit who can access that part of the network, and then have another FWs in the datacenters to limit who can access the servers?\n\nOr firewalls as the default gw everywhere (like in that credit card audit requirement in the US I heard about?)\n\nCurrently we have a network with a single VSS core switch pair that's doing the routing but not limiting who can access what. And remote sites behind a router with their own IP network, however they can access other VLANs/remote sites via the core switches. I'd like to move our network towards a MPLS network with each segment in their own VRF and a 0.0.0.0/0 route in a VRF pointing to a firewalls interface.\n\nThis way I could separate all the traffic between the segments, as most of our traffic is between the \"segment\" and server network. If some segments wants to talk to eachother, it would have to go through the firewall and I could see the traffic and manage it.\n\nWhere we live there's no point having SD-WAN as MPLS L3VPN/L2VPNs to our HQ are the same or cheaper than internet access for the remote sites. Also our remote locations are places where we can easily get 100Mbps or 1Gig connections quite cheap so the bandwidth's not the problem\n\nI know it's a huge post sorry about that.

            "selftext": "It's that time of the year for us in the education industry to start doing network audits, make hardware recommendations, and start the E-Rate process for any network upgrades we'd like to make next summer.  While thinking about what I'd like to do for the ~40 sites we manage, my main pain point I've been grappling over is how big some of their private LANs have gotten.  So what I'm mainly looking for is a general standard that I can follow to make my recommendations off of.  Here's what I'm thinking at the moment.\n\nVLANs (we follow this for the most part already)\n\n* Private LAN (wired and wireless)\n* Public LAN (wireless)\n* Distance Learning (video conferencing)\n* DMZ\n* Voice\n* Security cameras\n\nI'm wanting to push some more layer 3 switching at some of our bigger sites following the 3-tier design model (core/distribution/access).  Basically, adding a distribution layer to the current collapsed core model.  The previous standard has been one core router/firewall and the above VLANs with however many switches are necessary.  The main question I'm asking here is where do you all draw that line and by what metrics?  Here's some of my preliminary thoughts on the issue.\n\n* Every building, no matter how small, has a layer 3 switch for distribution of the building.  I don't think LAN broadcast traffic should ever traverse a point-to-point layer 2 transport link.\n* No more than 20 switches per access switch block.  I don't know if 20 is the right number here or if other factors are more important, but around here seems to me like too big of a failure domain for spanning tree.\n* No more than 2000 average active clients per broadcast domain.  Again, not sure on the exact number and I realize that what these clients are doing is more important, but for an average user just using a web browser and email, I would think the number should be around here somewhere.\n\nAny site that I roll out this 3-tier design to I'd also like the core switch for the site do all internal routing with OSPF running between the core and distribution layers.  The firewall would then move from the core router to just a firewall/NAT device where only traffic leaving the internal network will traverse it.

In fact, the only queue that appears to increment is the multicast-be queue.\n\nOn the other hand, when I check my firewall counters, it appears the filter is indeed seeing the traffic since it increments correctly.\n\nWhen I sniff the traffic, I see unicast traffic with the correct unicast IP source and destination addresses as well as any custom DSCP or ieee-802.1 values.\n\nLastly, and the part that is really messing with my head, is the fact that CoS/QoS shaping looks like it is working as I configured it. I can send data using one or more streams, up to the shaped rate on my access ports using the same source IP, destination port, and UDP protocol combination that my filter is looking for, while at the same time sending a \"saturation\" stream on a different port (it also has the input filter configured) which should be placed into the best-effort queue. The shaped stream will not lose any frames while the \"saturation\" stream shows frame loss. However, once the link is OVER saturated, both streams start to drop, which I believe is to be expected (I do not have a drop rule which places my shaped stream at a higher priority then say network-control traffic).\n\nMy current theory is that queue counters do increment due to one of the following:\n\n1. This is a layer 2 trunk (CoS) and those counters only show layer 3 (QoS).\n1. The EXFO test sets are some how screwing with the CoS/QoS values.\n1. Software glitch? I am using the Juniper suggested version.\n\nSo am I crazy or what? Why does it seem like its working, but not showing any indication other than a firewall counter that increments? Please help me!

Phones are populating the mac table in the correct vlan, all devices passed dot1x, voice vlan isn't pruned on either side of the trunk.  I pull configs from the access and distro switch into NCM in Solarwinds, compare changes, there's zero changes in the last 27 days.\n\nOk now I'm confused so I do a show spanning-tree and while all other vlans are behaving properly I notice there is no root port for the voice vlan.  I then notice for that vlan only it says \"this bridge is the root bridge\" (no, it isn't!)  All ports are Designated FWD.\n\nSo I do show spanning-tree on the distro switch too.  For the voice vlan it also shows this is the root bridge and all ports are Designated and FWD.  \n\nI spend the next five minutes or so trying to figure out why, but the spanning tree config is all correct and nothing's changed.  No port on either switch shows BLK, but obviously something ain't right.  And it can't be a loop because the distro switch is a VSS pair and connects to the access switch with a multi chassis port-channel, and both interfaces are properly bundled on both sides, LACP negotiated properly.\n\nI finally run out of ideas and do shut, no shut on the Port-Channel interface from the distribution switch's side.  After doing the shut, no shut, everything just started working fine.  Access switch no longer sees itself as root bridge for the voice vlan, and the po going to distro is now a root port.

Programs like mXt seem to do WAY more than SCRT (file transfers, RDP, scripting/macros) ... and they look much better!\n\nThe only feature that SCRT had over mXt was cross-functionality between Windows and Mac. SCRT allowed me save my sessions to cloud storage and have them available on my laptop, desktop and my many, many jumphosts. I am in Windows vs Mac about 60/40.\n\nMy enterprise license for SCRT is for an older version only, so my manager agreed to let me upgrade to anything of my choice. So far, I have heard Zoc is good, but I haven't looked into too much yet. However, besides SCRT obviously, there really doesn't seem to be too many other options.\n\nI would appreciate people's advice and feedback - you'd think the options would much better in 2017!

Before I came on board the company signed a two year contract for a secondary pipe for a couple of remote sites to sit along side the Verizon Managed Business MPLS circuit.

Now i'm stuff with a WAN router that is owned and managed by VZ and a secondary drop from another carrier with nothing to plug into.  I was able to find the a few routers laying around to terminate the second connection but not my problem is how to a design the remote site.  I'm thinking of plugging the LAN side of the VZ Router into the router I managed along side the secondary circuit and configuring IPSLA.  I'm still up in the air on how i will do this on the head end.  \n\nI'm pushing hard to get SDWAN into the budget for next year that will ultimately resolve this all problem. \n\nWhat do you think.

It's a mid-career change for him to move from retail/food-service into IT, and after a really intense job search that was hard and frustrating (over a year of not even being able to land an internship) he finally got an internship about six months ago and worked hard enough that they hired him full-time in a network analyst position. \n\nI'm sort of a nerdy wife who loves to hear about his day, reads up on networking pages like this to better understand what he does, and have helped him study for certs and his community college Cisco Academy program, and I would love to get him some kind of a nerdy gift to celebrate... something like a poster for his new office, or a relevant resource for him, something that will help him in his first \"real\" position in the field, etc.  Do you have any ideas? We're already planning some fun ways to celebrate, but I was interested in figuring out something that might also be relevant, clever, or helpful. \n\nAny advice for me as well in terms of how to best be supportive other than to encourage him, listen, and expect that the first few months will be an intense learning curve would also be greatly appreciated! \n\nThanks in advance!

A traceroute shows that the traffic makes the first hop over to the Cisco, then dies there.

            "selftext": "Trying to use Fabric to get some parallel command execution across our wireless infrastructure, but I'm having issues getting it working with ArubaOS. Here's my fabfile:\n\n    from fabric.api import *\n    env.hosts = ['switch', 'wlc']\n    def clock():\n        run(\"show clock\\n\", shell=False)\n\nRunning `fab clock` returns the correct output for the IOS device, but once we get to the ArubaOS device, I'm dropped into an interactive session on the WLC:\n\n    [wlc] Executing task 'clock'\n    [wlc] run: show clock\n    [wlc] out: \n    [wlc] out: \n    [wlc] out: (wlc) #\n    [wlc] out: (wlc) #\n    [wlc] out: (wlc) #\n    [wlc] out: (wlc) #exitConnection closed by foreign host.\n    [wlc] out: \n    Fatal error: run() received nonzero return code 1 while executing!\n    Requested: show clock\n    Executed: show clock\n    Aborting.\n\nI've run into issue with some other packages (e.g., ansible, netmiko, napalm, etc.) that I assumed were related to some regex magic on the return prompt. ArubaOS wraps the hostname in parenthesis. I just use paramiko as a work around (so does fabric), but I'm craving parallel execution.\n\nAny ideas?\n\nEDIT: I found the [Troubleshooting](http://www.fabfile.org/troubleshooting.html) page in the docs. Looks like I don't have the ability to run commands directly from my SSH command (i.e., `ssh switch \"show clock\"`). That command works for IOS devices (though it takes a while). Doesn't work on ArubaOS. Not sure how exactly Fabric is using paramiko. Will need to dig into the code I guess.\n\nEDIT2: Found the relevant bit in the [operations.py](https://github.com/fabric/fabric/blob/master/fabric/operations.py#L721) module:\n\n    # Kick off remote command\n    if invoke_shell:\n        channel.invoke_shell()\n        if command:\n            channel.sendall(command + \"\\n\")\n    else:\n        channel.exec_command(command=command)\n\nHere's the docstring for `_execute`:\n\n    ``invoke_shell`` controls whether we use ``exec_command`` or\n    ``invoke_shell`` (plus a handful of other things, such as always forcing a\n    pty.)\n\nUnfortunately, I'm not experienced enough to figure out how to set that value. It seems to be set to `False` when `_execute` is called. Tried `fab --set invoke_shell=True -I clock`, but it must be overwritten or something.",

Typically on the CPE side we use Routers, and can nest a QoS policy within a Traffic Shaping policy to handle WAN Links with a CIR < Interface Speed.\n\nHowever on this one, I had to use a Cisco 3560 on the CPE - which can shape traffic somewhat, using strict round-robin bandwidth limits.\n\nIn the attached image: https://i.imgur.com/wJsrrZ4.png\nI did some tests in a lab environment, applying the generic \"auto qos trust dscp\" template to the interface, as well as a \"srr-queue bandwidth limit\" to shape the traffic to as close to the CIR of the WAN circuit as possible, using both 100 and 1000Mbps link speeds.\nThis way, the 3560 will apply the QoS before the CIR bandwidth is congested, reducing output drops for Voice packets.\n\nI hope this helps anyone else in this situation!\n\nEdit: The bandwidth tests were done using vanilla iperf 2.0.5 between two machines running Ubuntu 16.04.

I\u2019ve implemented 4500-X VSS pairs in other smaller sites with basically no issues, but I'd like to take advantage of some of the service level features of the 6800 series over the 4500 at this site. I thought about refurbishing my existing 6509-E\u2019s with new 2T SUPs and 10G line cards but the cost basically matched just upgrading to the 6840X\u2019s. These 6840's will be linking to another site via dual 10G SM lines to a 4500-X VSS pair. \n\nEdit: I've been able to convince management that a 10-year core replacement cycle is a good idea so I'm hoping to run these for the next 10 years or so. Other options I considered were 6880-X and the Catalyst 9500. I'm nervous about switching to the 9500 on the core layer without being able to do it on the access layer near-term (next 2-3 years at least).\n",

See here for more - https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/6u1cr2/strange_issue_on_a_few_vlans/\n\nA very similar issue is now occurring in our network and I have no idea why.  I have seen a few repeat VLANS, but reports are than its happening everywhere in my network.  Wired and Wireless clients alike. \n\nFrom a basic perspective clients are coming online and getting valid IP addresses, but no ARP table entries are being created and thus their traffic cannot route.  Strangely enough pings to the client (when in this state) are inconsistent at best.  Sometimes 2 or 3 pings will drop and a few come back with very high times and sometimes no pings come back at all.  Even stranger, is that although the client cannot really interact at all with the network, I can connect to them via VNC.  Once I have VNC access I run an \u201cipconfig /release && ipconfig /renew\u201d (sometimes it takes more than 1 try) and then the client comes up (same IP address) and can now interact with the network.\n\nI have interrogated most parts of the network and the only thing I have found is that shutting down a particular link aggregation member seems to make the issue \u201cbetter\u201d although I have seen it on a few clients after making this change.\n\nWe have two data centers in separate locations.  We use 2 HP 7500 Chassis configured in an IRF to accomplish this.  Basically each \u201csite\u201d connects to each data center at 10Gb - 2 links per site = Link Agg.  We treat our switch stacks that we use for our servers at each site as another \u201csite\u201d  The particular link that I have found to help the issue is one of the links that are a member of the server switch link agg - See here for a drawing - http://imgur.com/a/k6k02\n\nI cannot reproduce the problem at all. Im struggling to find any logs anywhere other than those on the client that just state they cant see DNS, DC\u2019s etc (Of course, their routing is effed)  No logs on any of the switches are any help.  Im completely at a loss as to where to go from here.  ",

And they have the audacity to tell me my network is broken? au contraire... \n\nSomething has changed, where drops are now pretty consistent.

The more I looked into this the more appalled I got. This is a low one, there are others up around 30k coming onto the network getting fragmented and broken up.\n\nI am thinking, how is their software supposed to work correctly if something gets out of sequence, or one UDP frame gets lost. That's a shit ton of overhead that has to come back on the network to make up for it. After the capture I did, its like 90% fragmented packets, all udp all 10,000+ frame/packet sizes. Its also why security cant figure out why they cant pass their packet. It wont pass fragments on research I did as well on the sonicwall.\n\nNo wonder the network is shit.  Right now I think its stable again unless a specific event happens from something I recorded from their software behavior, but I cringe at how long I can continue to make this work as they grow... and they are ok with this.

There's a command I'm trying to run that doesn't seem to exist in the new switch.\n\n\nThere are commands in the old config:\n\n    mls qos srr-queue input threshold 1 80 90\n    mls qos srr-queue input priority-queue 2 bandwidth 30\n    mls qos srr-queue input cos-map queue 1 threshold 2 3\n\n(there's more but that's the gist)\nSo on the new switch I'm trying to run:\n\n    mls qos srr-queue ?\n\nBut the choices on that only allow Output, not Input. Output commands work as expected.\n\n\nOnly support case I've found online is them saying that the command doesn't exist, but not what it has been replaced with or what to do to get those input lines in.\n\n\nAnyone have experience with QOS on old and new Ciscos? I spend way more time on Extreme switches so I'm not sure what Cisco is looking for here.\n\n\nEDIT: Clarity",

This model is a smart switch, so not a fully managed switch.\nWhen I plug it into the network at my desk, it does not generate an uplink. But when I use the same cable to connect my PC, it works. I had tried some things: static IPs etc.\n\nWhen I plugged it directly into an unmanaged switch in the server room, it generated the uplink immediately. I did this with a straight through cable, but I think this model can auto detect straight or crossover.\n\nWhat could be the problem here? Is there a voltage drop across the cable that is so large that the switch does not detect the network, but the PC can operate with a lower voltage?\n\nEDIT: the switch is the server room is unmanaged (Netgear JGS524F), not a fully managed switch working as an unmanaged one.",

            "selftext": "Here is a post I did for /r/CCNA y'all might like\n\n\nI has chatting with a fellow colleague about the value in seeing the bigger picture when learning topics the other day and had an idea, lets look at a relatively complex example of the full MPLS VPN picture. The point of this is that you can see that advanced solutions are often just the sum of other features and concepts being combined. Plus if you happen to be interesting in the SP track, your day has arrived!\n\n#Topology\n\nThe [topology](https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/2nKNEDz4/mpls-top) today is a good 20 routers in VIRL broken up into a few groups.\n\n* 6 x Provider (P) routers - This is the ISP core that runs OSPF and MPLS\n* 6 x Provider Edge (PE) routers - These routers run BGP and MPLS for the VPN, they also have the VRFs for the CE routers.\n* 2 x Route Reflectors (RR) routers - These are Route Reflector routers, all the PE routers peer to them to receive the VPNv4 routes.\n* 6 x Customer Edge (CE) routers - These are the Customer routers, this is what most of you would see when you order a MPLS service from a ISP.\n\nThere are two customers in this topology, CUST-A and CUST-B, very original I know!\n\n\n# Provider Routers\n\n###The Basics\n\nThe P routers just provide the routing between the PE routers so we just make sure we have IPs on the interfaces and turn on OSPF.\nFor MPLS we will need a /32 loopback address, this is because OSPF will automatically advertise a loopback as a /32 route no matter what the mask is and that will mess with the MPLS side of things.\n\n    P01(config)#do sh ip int br | ex unass|0/0\n    Interface                  IP-Address      OK?

But because MPLS labels are dynamically generated and are locally significant, we'll explicitly define the MPLS ranges so our traceroutes are easier to read.\n\n    P01(config)#mpls label range 100 199\n    \n    P02(config)#mpls label range 200 299\n    \n    P03(config)#mpls label range 300 399\n    \n    P04(config)#mpls label range 400 499\n    \n    P05(config)#mpls label range 500 599\n    \n    P06(config)#mpls label range 600 699\n\nOSPF has a MPLS feature that automagically enables LDP on all OSPF enabled interfaces \n\n    P01(config)#router ospf 1\n    P01(config-router)# mpls ldp autoconfig\n\nOnce all our P's are configured we can view the MPLS version of the routing table to see what label a particular route will use.\n\n**Note:**At this point we are using MPLS forwarding in our core! This means that things like ACLs won't be able to affect the MPLS traffic unless you block MPLS entirely.\n\n\n    P01#show mpls forwarding-table \n    Local      Outgoing   Prefix           Bytes Label   Outgoing   Next Hop    \n    Label      Label      or Tunnel Id     Switched      interface              \n    100        200        192.168.255.16/32   \\\n                                           0             Gi0/1      10.1.2.2    \n               501        192.168.255.16/32   \\\n                                           0             Gi0/4      10.1.5.5    \n    101        500        192.168.255.15/32   \\\n                                           0             Gi0/4      10.1.5.5    \n    102        202        192.168.255.6/32 0             Gi0/1      10.1.2.2    \n               502        192.168.255.6/32 0             Gi0/4      10.1.5.5    \n    103        Pop Label  192.168.255.5/32 0             Gi0/4      10.1.5.5    \n    104        Pop Label  192.168.255.4/32 1229          Gi0/2      10.1.4.4    \n    105        205        192.168.255.3/32 0             Gi0/1      10.1.2.2    \n               504        192.168.255.3/32 0             Gi0/4      10.1.5.5    \n    106        Pop Label  192.168.255.2/32 0             Gi0/1      10.1.2.2    \n    107        Pop Label  10.4.14.0/24     0             Gi0/2      10.1.4.4    \n    108        208        10.3.13.0/24     0             Gi0/1      10.1.2.2    \n               506        10.3.13.0/24     0             Gi0/4      10.1.5.5    \n    109        Pop Label  10.2.255.0/24    0             Gi0/1      10.1.2.2    \n    110        Pop Label  10.2.12.0/24     0             Gi0/1      10.1.2.2    \n    111        Pop Label  10.2.6.0/24      0             Gi0/1      10.1.2.2    \n    112        Pop Label  10.2.5.0/24      0             Gi0/1      10.1.2.2    \n               Pop Label  10.2.5.0/24      0             Gi0/4      10.1.5.5    \n    113        Pop Label  10.2.4.0/24      0             Gi0/1      10.1.2.2    \n               Pop Label  10.2.4.0/24      0             Gi0/2      10.1.4.4    \n    114        Pop Label  10.2.3.0/24      0             Gi0/1      10.1.2.2    \n    115        217        10.6.16.0/24     0             Gi0/1      10.1.2.2    \n               511        10.6.16.0/24     0             Gi0/4      10.1.5.5    \n    116        216        10.3.6.0/24      0             Gi0/1      10.1.2.2    \n               512        10.3.6.0/24      0             Gi0/4      10.1.5.5    \n    117        Pop Label  10.5.6.0/24      0             Gi0/4      10.1.5.5    \n    118        Pop Label  10.3.5.0/24      0             Gi0/4      10.1.5.5    \n    119        Pop Label  10.5.15.0/24     0             Gi0/4      10.1.5.5    \n    120        Pop Label  10.4.5.0/24      0             Gi0/2      10.1.4.4    \n               Pop Label  10.4.5.0/24      0             Gi0/4      10.1.5.5\n\n#Provider Edge Routers\n\n###The Basics\n\nThe PEs are about the same except their label range starts at 10000 for PE01 and ends at 60000 for PE06, this is because I have added some IOS-XR routers for fun and their labels start at 16000.\n\n\n    PE01(config)#mpls label range 10000 19999\n    PE01(config)#\n    PE01(config)#router ospf 1\n    PE01(config-router)# network 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255 area 0\n    PE01(config-router)# mpls ldp autoconfig\n\nThe XR way of doing this is:\n\n    RP/0/0/CPU0:PE05(config)#router ospf 1\n    RP/0/0/CPU0:PE05(config-ospf)# mpls ldp auto-config\n    RP/0/0/CPU0:PE05(config-ospf)# area 0.0.0.0\n    RP/0/0/CPU0:PE05(config-ospf-ar)#  interface Loopback0\n    RP/0/0/CPU0:PE05(config-ospf-ar-if)#  interface GigabitEthernet0/0/0/0\n    \n    RP/0/0/CPU0:PE05(config)#mpls ldp\n    RP/0/0/CPU0:PE05(config)#mpls label range table 0 50000 59999\n\n###The VRFs\n\nThe PE puts each customer's route into a separate routing table, this among other things allows customer's to use the same address space without any conflict. We do that by making a VRF to store the routes. We have two customers so there will be CUST-A and CUST-B depending on the router.\n\nThe MPLS solution needs a Route Distinguisher to keep the customer routes unique, we also need to tell BGP what routes we want the customer to receive with the route target. Lastly we tell the router what address family we want, we'll just look at IPv4 right now.\n\n**Note:** To save some time I've put the same VRFs and values on all the PE routers, though we could use unique RDs for each router to allow for more granular control of routes.\n\n\n    PE01(config)#vrf definition CUST-A\n    PE01(config-vrf)# rd 100:101\n    PE01(config-vrf)# route-target export 100:101\n    PE01(config-vrf)# route-target import 100:101\n    PE01(config-vrf)# !\n    PE01(config-vrf)# address-family ipv4\n\n    PE01(config)#vrf definition CUST-B\n    PE01(config-vrf)# rd 100:102\n    PE01(config-vrf)# route-target export 100:102\n    PE01(config-vrf)# route-target import 100:102\n    PE01(config-vrf)# !\n    PE01(config-vrf)# address-family ipv4\n    \nThen we need to add the interface that connects the CE router to the VRF.\n\n**Note:** If you have an IP on the interface the router will remove it when you add a VRF!\n\n    PE01(config)#interface GigabitEthernet3\n    PE01(config-if)# vrf forwarding CUST-A\n    PE01(config-if)# ip address 192.168.1.254 255.255.255.0\n\nNow that this is done we can view the interface in its own routing table\n\n    PE01(config-if)#do sh ip route vrf CUST-A | be Gateway\n    Gateway of last resort is not set\n    \n          192.168.1.0/24 is variably subnetted, 2 subnets, 2 masks\n    C        192.168.1.0/24 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet3\n    L        192.168.1.254/32 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet3\n\nThe XR routers do things a bit differently like so\n\n\n    RP/0/0/CPU0:PE05(config)#vrf CUST-A\n    RP/0/0/CPU0:PE05(config-vrf)# address-family ipv4 unicast\n    RP/0/0/CPU0:PE05(config-vrf-af)#  import route-target\n    RP/0/0/CPU0:PE05(config-vrf-import-rt)#   100:101\n    RP/0/0/CPU0:PE05(config-vrf-import-rt)#  export route-target\n    RP/0/0/CPU0:PE05(config-vrf-export-rt)#   100:101\n    \n    RP/0/0/CPU0:PE05(config)#vrf CUST-B\n    RP/0/0/CPU0:PE05(config-vrf)# address-family ipv4 unicast\n    RP/0/0/CPU0:PE05(config-vrf-af)#  import route-target\n    RP/0/0/CPU0:PE05(config-vrf-import-rt)#   100:102\n    RP/0/0/CPU0:PE05(config-vrf-import-rt)#  export route-target\n    RP/0/0/CPU0:PE05(config-vrf-export-rt)#   100:102\n\n\n    RP/0/0/CPU0:PE05(config)#interface GigabitEthernet0/0/0/1\n    RP/0/0/CPU0:PE05(config-if)# description to CE05\n    RP/0/0/CPU0:PE05(config-if)# vrf CUST-B\n    RP/0/0/CPU0:PE05(config-if)# ipv4 address 192.168.5.254 255.255.255.0\n\n###BGP\n\nThe BGP portion is probably the most config heavy we have seen so far, to make things a bit more concise we are going to utilize a BGP feature called templates, templates let you group similar configurations together so we don't have to repeat the neighbor configuration for all of our peers.\n\nAll the PEs will peer with each route reflector that is running for the VPNv4 family. Here is the first RR configuration which is identical to the other one. Each peer calls a template and only the VPNv4 address-family is running.\n\n**Note:** The RRs don't actually run MPLS because they aren't in the data path, they just make sure all the PEs get the routes. \n\n\n    RR12(config)#router bgp 65123\n    RR12(config-router)# template peer-policy MPLSVPN-POLICY\n    RR12(config-router-ptmp)#  route-reflector-client\n    RR12(config-router-ptmp)#  send-community both\n    RR12(config-router-ptmp)# exit-peer-policy\n    RR12(config-router)# !\n    RR12(config-router)# template peer-session MPLSVPN-PEER\n    RR12(config-router-stmp)#  remote-as 65123\n    RR12(config-router-stmp)#  update-source Loopback0\n    RR12(config-router-stmp)# exit-peer-session\n    RR12(config-router)# !\n    RR12(config-router)# bgp cluster-id 1.2.3.4\n    RR12(config-router)# bgp log-neighbor-changes\n    RR12(config-router)# no bgp default ipv4-unicast\n    RR12(config-router)# neighbor 192.168.255.11 inherit peer-session MPLSVPN-PEER\n    RR12(config-router)# neighbor 192.168.255.12 inherit peer-session MPLSVPN-PEER\n    RR12(config-router)# neighbor 192.168.255.13 inherit peer-session MPLSVPN-PEER\n    RR12(config-router)# neighbor 192.168.255.14 inherit peer-session MPLSVPN-PEER\n    RR12(config-router)# neighbor 192.168.255.15 inherit peer-session MPLSVPN-PEER\n    RR12(config-router)# neighbor 192.168.255.16 inherit peer-session MPLSVPN-PEER\n    RR12(config-router)# neighbor 192.168.255.123 inherit peer-session MPLSVPN-PEER\n    RR12(config-router)# !\n    RR12(config-router)# address-family vpnv4\n    RR12(config-router-af)#  neighbor 192.168.255.11 activate\n    RR12(config-router-af)#  neighbor 192.168.255.11 send-community extended\n    RR12(config-router-af)#  neighbor 192.168.255.11 inherit peer-policy MPLSVPN-POLICY\n    RR12(config-router-af)#  neighbor 192.168.255.12 activate\n    RR12(config-router-af)#  neighbor 192.168.255.12 send-community extended\n    RR12(config-router-af)#  neighbor 192.168.255.12 inherit peer-policy MPLSVPN-POLICY\n    RR12(config-router-af)#  neighbor 192.168.255.13 activate\n    RR12(config-router-af)#  neighbor 192.168.255.13 send-community extended\n    RR12(config-router-af)#  neighbor 192.168.255.13 inherit peer-policy MPLSVPN-POLICY\n    RR12(config-router-af)#  neighbor 192.168.255.14 activate\n    RR12(config-router-af)#  neighbor 192.168.255.14 send-community extended\n    RR12(config-router-af)#  neighbor 192.168.255.14 inherit peer-policy MPLSVPN-POLICY\n    RR12(config-router-af)#  neighbor 192.168.255.15 activate\n    RR12(config-router-af)#  neighbor 192.168.255.15 send-community extended\n    RR12(config-router-af)#  neighbor 192.168.255.15 inherit peer-policy MPLSVPN-POLICY\n    RR12(config-router-af)#  neighbor 192.168.255.16 activate\n    RR12(config-router-af)#  neighbor 192.168.255.16 send-community extended\n    RR12(config-router-af)#  neighbor 192.168.255.16 inherit peer-policy MPLSVPN-POLICY\n    RR12(config-router-af)#  neighbor 192.168.255.123 activate\n    RR12(config-router-af)#  neighbor 192.168.255.123 send-community extended\n    RR12(config-router-af)#  neighbor 192.168.255.123 inherit peer-policy MPLSVPN-POLICY\n    RR12(config-router-af)# exit-address-family\n\n\nOn each of the PEs we do a IBGP peering with each RR, we'll also use templates to keep things clean.\n\n    PE01(config)#router bgp 65123\n    PE01(config-router)# template peer-policy MPLSVPN-POLICY\n    PE01(config-router-ptmp)#  send-community both\n    PE01(config-router-ptmp)# exit-peer-policy\n    PE01(config-router)# !\n    PE01(config-router)# template peer-session MPLSVPN-PEER\n    PE01(config-router-stmp)#  remote-as 65123\n    PE01(config-router-stmp)#  update-source Loopback0\n    PE01(config-router-stmp)# exit-peer-session\n    PE01(config-router)# !\n    PE01(config-router)# bgp log-neighbor-changes\n    PE01(config-router)# no bgp default ipv4-unicast\n    PE01(config-router)# neighbor 192.168.255.112 inherit peer-session MPLSVPN-PEER\n    PE01(config-router)# neighbor 192.168.255.134 inherit peer-session MPLSVPN-PEER\n    PE01(config-router)# !\n    PE01(config-router)# address-family vpnv4\n    PE01(config-router-af)#  neighbor 192.168.255.112 activate\n    PE01(config-router-af)#  neighbor 192.168.255.112 send-community extended\n    PE01(config-router-af)#  neighbor 192.168.255.112 inherit peer-policy MPLSVPN-POLICY\n    PE01(config-router-af)#  neighbor 192.168.255.134 activate\n    PE01(config-router-af)#  neighbor 192.168.255.134 send-community extended\n    PE01(config-router-af)#  neighbor 192.168.255.134 inherit peer-policy MPLSVPN-POLICY\n\n\n###CE Routing / Redistribution\n\nNext we need to have the VRF run a routing protocol and have the routes be learned by BGP and back again.\n\nWe need to enable VRF aware routing on each protocol.\n\nWith OSPF we have to make a new process that calls the VRF we want to use.

complex topology than you would see in a typical CCNA R&S day to day.

If so, you are in luck! I have open sourced a quick little script that can accomplish this task in an easy yet flexible manner.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo, without further ado, I present to you the **Quick Deployment Script**!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n### **Prerequisites:**\n\n- Python 3 (I recommend Python 3.4.4)\n- Libraries \u2013 Netmiko and Colorama\n\n&nbsp;\n\n### **The entire source can be found here:**\n\nhttps://github.com/syedur-rahman/pyability/tree/master/scripts/p02_quick_deploy\n\n&nbsp;\n\n### **Here\u2019s the script in action in GIF form:**\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/gVQ6N5T.gifv\n\n&nbsp;\n\n## **USING THE SCRIPT**\n\nThere are two text files you need to edit \u2013 **devices.txt** and **commands.txt** \u2013 in order to use this script.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn the **devices.txt** file, you place your device ip address or dns entries, like so:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n    10.0.0.1\n    10.0.0.2\n    10.0.0.3\n    10.0.0.4, cisco_nxos\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBy default, the script assumes all devices are **cisco_ios**, but you may specify a different one as demonstrated above. All possible device listings can be found [here](https://github.com/ktbyers/netmiko/blob/master/netmiko/ssh_dispatcher.py) in the ***CLASS_MAPPER_BASE*** dictionary.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn the **commands.txt** file, you place all your commands, like so:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n    show version\n    conf t\n    interface fa0/0\n      no shut\n    end\n    show int status\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAs the script is designed to log data by default, you may enter in \u201cshow\u201d commands as well. The output of the \u201cshow\u201d commands will be stored in the generated log file.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe script assumes nothing, so you **must** specify that you need to enter configuration terminal. If you need to run \u201cshow\u201d commands after configuration updates, please make sure to ***\u2018end\u2019*** out of the configuration terminal like the above. That way you can do some real time post verification!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nGood luck and happy automating!\n\n",

We use a Comcast EVPL between sites which are right next to one another. Good and consistent ping times. Our PRI connects centrally and communicates to each location over our Comcast fiber. Half the time calls sound sparse and choppy within the same building. I am concerned I haven't correctly configured this switch. I read and tried a variety of things from googling and am hoping for some personal experience. I am only adding QoS to the voice vlan. This is the master switch.

The call quality is at its worst between locations. They are telling me that COS will not fix my problem since my ping time between buildings is 2ish ms. They also told me they have no QoS-type service that they can apply to our traffic between locations. This just really causes a lot of questions. I was on the phone with a sales engineer, account manager and \"voice specialist\" guy from who knows what position. They want to sell us more bandwidth which I would love. We don't have the money and really I just need to spend time traffic shaping. Any thoughts or suggestions? If I left anything out I will add it should someone comment.

I replaced them with a pair of virtualized pfSense routers in HA and performance is awesome.  It's definitely a lot more time-consuming to manage, but I gained a lot of flexibility.\n\nIn the switching world, what's the closest?  Those UBNT switches are out of course.  I've used HP a lot, but their UI is shit and while I could learn the CLI better, I'm going to be modifying this configuration just infrequently enough to forget how to do anything each time.\n\nThe price for an MS350-48 + license is $6,500+ on Amazon.  Not sure what it is with the usual 45-50% discounts but it's still a lot.  If I have to pay that I will because time is money, but that should allow some pretty solid recommendations I hope.\n\nedit: I realize I didn't put much into what I use.

Some of them also had a Y after that number, to indicate ROHS compliance. Variations that should also work include F5PE6P-10M* (plenum rated, not necessary, but I'll take it) and FXE6P-10M* (OM3 rated 50/125\u00b5m, as well as FXPE6P-10M*, the plenum version of the OM3 rated)\n\nAt this point, any length will do, if I have to find a way to carefully bundle up 10 extra meters of fiber, but I can connect my switches, so be it.

The three uplink to a Cisco 4500 10 gig blade.\n* Standard switch vSwitch1 has two of the uplinks, vmnic0 and vmnic1. They connect to two configured trunk ports on the 4500. They are set to route by originating port ID in the link aggregation settings of the vSwitch.\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n        interface TenGigabitEthernet3/1\n        switchport mode trunk\n        switchport nonegotiate\n        spanning-tree portfast trunk\n        end\n* A port group has been created that is in vlan 200 and is assigned to this vSwitch.\n* A Windows 2012 R2 VM has been created and added to this port group. \n\nThe main issue I am seeing is that, for whatever reason, the guest VM is not receiving the ARP reply for the default gateway for vlan 200 (which is an SVI on the 4500). I can ping other hosts on the subnet, but not the gateway. I can see the mac of the VM, the ARP for the VM, etc, on the 4500... I can even see the ARP reply back to the VM for the gateway when doing a wireshark capture but it never shows up in the client's ARP table. I can manually add the ARP entry on the guest with a netsh command and everything starts working, but why would the gateway ARP not complete? I've also tried this with a separate linux VM and I am seeing the same behavior. \n\nI may be leaving some stuff out, its been quite a long time troubleshooting this, so I do apologize if that is the case.

The goal is that client to client routes do not get the next hop updated by the route reflector, only routes originated by the route reflector.\n\nEDIT: formatting ",

            "selftext": "Hello good people,\n\nFor the purposes of exposing the true source IP address to the backend server, I'm running a layer two npath setup aka direct server return, which essentially has the forward traffic go through the F5 but the reply goes directly from the backend server to the firewall (hence the name direct server return). This didn't work at all but F5 was adamant that they were unable to reproduce the issue and that in their setup it was working fine.\nTurns out that the F5 adds a custom ethernet trailer, in which it writes a bunch of stuff including:\n0 - connection tracking information.\n1 - name of the virtual server\n2 - address of the virtual server\n3 - port of the virtual server\n4 - layer 4 protocol of the virtual server\n5 - vlan of the virtual server\n6 - local and remote ports\n\nIn their own reproduction of my setup F5 support used a Linux VM as a router, whereas my setup actually uses a Palo Alto firewall. Turns out, the Palo Alto wipes all this Ethernet trailer information and while most of it seems to be there to help with troubleshooting, the connection tracking info is actually used by the load balancer to match it's connection table, and if it's not there, the packet will be dropped.\n\nThis raises a few questions, and I'm hoping there's an F5 guru around here that can shed some light on them.\n\n1 - Why write this information in the Ethernet trailer? Seems a very odd place to do this. Why not write this as a TCP or IP option? I know Riverbed WAN optimizers use some unused section of the TCP header to do their dirty work, why doesn't F5 do something similar. Even when having to pass an encrypted connection the IP and TCP headers would still be readable by an intermediate device.\n2 - How is it possible to extend the frame? What happens if you get a frame which is already the maximum allowed size, how do you fit in this extra info without exceeding MTU?\n3 - What guarantees that this information stays there? My example with the PaloAlto is a bad example since here the firewall wiped the info, however firewalls usually don't like any kind of IP or TCP/UDP options and remove them out of some kind of paranoia seems natural they would do the same with Layer2 shenanigans. It looks like in normal operation, the backend server that replies to the connection while changing the mac addresses in the ethernet frame, keeps the trailer. And apparently so do routers (as proven by F5 support's replication of my setup). Though I imagine that when a packet has to cross a non-ethernet link (say frame-relay) there will be no place to store that information and then it would definetly be lost.\n4 - According to wikipedia this trailer is only 4 bytes, however, there's a lot more information in there. It seems to be breaking from the standard, but how would that be possible, and how would other standard abiding devices understand it then?\n\n\nCheers!\n\nPaul",

Clients use dynamic dns (dynamic IP) to reach the app in the field. For it to work on the LAN, I added a zone to their Windows DNS server that resolves to the internal address. So, say example.no-ip.com resolves to 10.10.10.1 on their LAN.\n  \n  \nNow, I set up an OpenVPN server, and joined the devices via software. VPN is always connected when outside the office. It works fine, however I still want these devices to run that app over the internet because it's unreliable/doesn't work over VPN.\n\nThe issue is that the mobile clients now resolve to the internal IP. If I disable the zone on the server, then it doesn't work on their LAN, only in the field. \n\nWindows 10 seems unpredictable when handing name resolution. Sometimes it'll query the DNS server over the VPN, sometimes it queries a server on the internet. \n\nIs there a simple/elegant solution? Clients need the internal dns server for AD, shares, etc, but I need this one application to use the public IP when in the field.\n\n\n",

From a Nortel 5510-48t to a 5520-48t-PWR. \n\nEverything was fine and dandy until randomly, without ANY changes having been made to either, one switch stack was no longer able to see the main one which then routes the traffic out through the firewall then the internet. \n\nAll of the computers on the main stack are working properly, as well as a third switch stack connected to it and the devices connected to that switch stack.\n\nUpon further investigation the GBIC on the stack that isn't working is lit up and showing activity. The lights on the GBIC on the main stack switch is only showing the link light solid (green) but no activity. Taking the gbic / fiber that runs to another switch stack in our facility and plugging it into the one that shows no activity but a solid link light and that connection works properly. So, does that eliminate port problems? Could it be the adapter that plugs into the port that has went bad? I tried taking the fiber from the port that was not working and plugging it into the GBIC that was working and it did the same thing with no activity but a solid link light. So I guess that eliminates the GBIC adapter as being the problem. \n\nI have included a network diagram, and pictures on imgur.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/trMMl\n\nEverything but the second switch stack and the devices plugged into it is connecting and talking properly. \nAny help at all would be greatly appreciated guys.\n",

Recently I learned that they are paying for 3 wans, and cannot interconnect sites, and no separation of guest and office wan. [So I decided to try designing a managed backbone](https://i.imgur.com/3rZ8GmJ.png)\n\nI hear that fiber is a fantastic way to future proof and much cheaper to run long and far than copper, so I designed the backbone with this in mind using mainly fiber.\n\nI mainly work in the configuration and logical side of networks but haven't gone into the physical design before. I would appreciate any input about how I can improve my current design and additional things I may need to take into consideration when planning.\n\nIn addition, I'm not exactly sure what gear I should deploy. While Ubiquiti is my go to for WiFi, And Cisco is the go to for managed switches in datacenters and larger installations. I do not know what the market is like for small business managed switches.\n\n\n\n\nMany thanks in advance for your advice!\n\nEDIT: Sorry, I forgot to label my diagram\n\n* Thick lines are fiber\n* double lines are copper/cat5-6\n* dashed lines with arrows are ptp wireless\n* dashed line from 3-2 is currently dark copper that's physical condition is unknown",

Essentially what I had to do is \"share\" the ISP WAN connection using a small Netgear switch, so I'm only actually using 3 ports. \n\nInitially I had considered getting a 24 port managed switch, turning off all but 3 of the ports, and disabling all but serial console access, but that still seems like a lot of hardware for the job. So, now I'm on the lookout for either a managed or unmanaged switch with 8 ports or less, that I can also rely on as it is THE single point of failure on my side that would take out both networks' access to the internet.\n\nIs a Netgear GS series switch really OK for this application, or should I do something different? Are there other options available? I'd really prefer something that can be rack-mounted, or possibly one of those switches that can attach to the side rails of the rack. I would also like to avoid another wall wart power supply if possible.\n\nFWIW, the internal devices are a Cisco ASA5510 (which runs the business wired network, most important), and a Cisco 3825, which runs the resident/guest networks (hence the desire to use a separate public IP). I have enough ports on the ASA that I could *technically* just connect the 3825 to the ASA, but an ASA != a switch, and I'd rather not create yet another VLAN/subnet at this point.\n\nI'd appreciate your thoughts!",

I am writing to humbly request additional eyes and opinions.\n\nThe process I executed to verify functionality of CoPP logging is as follows:\n\n* clone the default 'strict' policy\n* configure a class with 'logging drop threshold 1 level 7'\n* configure that class's policer to drop both conforming and violating traffic to test\n* apply the new policy to the control-plane\n* confirm that the class-map is dropping by viewing the output of 'show policy-map interface control-plane'\n* confirm that no log messages are being generated\n\nIf you've encountered similar issues or see an obvious misstep detailed above please let me know! \n\nEdit to add more detail:\nHere's a config snippet of the map to show the line for logging:\n\n    class copp-class-monitoring-LOGGING\n        set cos 1\n        logging drop threshold 1 level 7\n        police cir 130 kbps bc 1000 ms conform drop violate drop\n\nMy expectation is that all traffic matching the copp-class-monitoring-LOGGING class-map should drop and each byte of drop should be sufficient to generate a log message.\n\n**Edit the second:**\nCisco reports that logging levels other than 1 do not work. Corrected config:\n\n    class copp-class-monitoring-LOGGING\n        set cos 1\n        logging drop threshold 1 level 1\n        police cir 130 kbps bc 1000 ms conform drop violate drop",

            "selftext": "Hello fellas,\n\nI am now in the process of testing some new solution for increasing bandwidth - Multi WAN - LTE internet.\n\n**Body:**\n\nSo why am I doing it... well, we have one site in a remote place that has literally no possibility to get fiber connection - at the moment there is simple DSL line that barely speeds up to 60/6 Mbps speed. The thing is, we are in a great range of LTE internet that reaches up to 60/30 Mbps.\n\nSo what I want to do, is to buy 4 LTE cards and aggregate them together to get the speed of 240/120 Mbps and connect it with the main office that has 500/500 Mbps fiber connection. Mainly I'd like to utilize offsite backup and some disaster recovery repository there, but also it is a remote backup to our clients.\n\n**Now to the point of the problem:**\n\nI need to max out the speed, so what I am looking for is not simple Link Aggregation or Gateway Grouping but WAN Bonding. As I am aware of, it is impossible to split packets and make them go parallelly through all 4 WANs to reach the whole internet (not 100% sure, am I wrong?). I need to create a VPN connection through all 4 WANs and then send the packets through VPN LAN.\n\nWhat I did was set up OpenVPN server in the main Office and configure clients through at the moment 2 WANs in remote office.\n\nFirst thing - I am getting the SAME IP address on both client connections, but that's probably a mistake in configuration.\n\nI would like to hear some ideas about bonding from You guys - preferably for pfSense (that we are using) but any technique would be great.\n\nEDIT1:\nI found some interesting tutorial on the internet regarding such bonding - https://www.simonmott.co.uk/2012/03/vpn-bonding/ maybe will work, I will keep ya updated.",

ISP was awful, but met lots of cool and very smart people.  VAR/MSP was similar to ISP but worse.  NOC was good to get my start, but I'd never do again unless in a managerial capacity.

From there, I can SSH to the second Pi3 that is *NOT* on Wifi and has a 10.10.20.116 address.\n\n10.10.20.0/24 *cannot* talk at all to the regular LAN of 10.10.10.0/24.  Why is this?  How would I get my regular LAN network (10.10.10.0/24) to talk to VLAN 250 (10.10.20.0/24)?  All of the routing rules are there and there is no firewall blocking traffic.\n\nFrom what I've been able to read about on the above, non-VLAN traffic cannot talk back and forth to VLAN traffic.  If that's the case, how do I get my 10.10.10.0/24 LAN switched over to a VLAN?  As far as I can tell, I would have to completely re-create it and everything would need to be connected to the physical switch that Port2 of the edgerouter is connected to and nothing can be directly attached to the edgerouter besides that switch.\n\nWould that be correct?\n\n-------------\n\n# Latest Update:\n\n* [2017-09-04 2:45PM CST](https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/6xumh8/first_time_setting_up_vlans/dmk7qp9/)",

(172.16.0.0/24)\n\n2) All of the clients are running Sophos XG's/PfSense routers with the same subnet (192.168.0.0/24) These subnets can't be changed, because of the outdated POS which uses hard-coded IP's.\n\n3) Create a IPsec site-to-site VPN on the PfSense in the datacenter and link them to each site, with a firewall rule to allow traffic only to the SMB share in the datacenter, rest is blocked.\n\n4) All of the sites do not need to communicate. They only need to talk to the datacenter.\n\nBut I'm stuck at how make sure that I can allow the \"same\" subnet multiple times in PfSense. Can anyone help?

However, I feel like there should be a SD-WAN or FaaS that provides that kind of DR option for external network traffic that has to flow directly through IP.\n\n\nWe already have a full block but they are all hard coded to old fashioned and .gov vendors. They are directly accessing these to connect to the database via IP.\n\nThis is the last bit. Current DR depends on a disaster destroying our entire A-Site but leaving the firewall still operational to reroute to our DR site. This is obviously terrible as any type of catastrophe like this would certainly kill the firewall as well.\n\nAny thoughts?",

            "selftext": "Hi all,   \nWe have a new vlan on our internal network that terminates on the Palo Alto instead of our core switching and uses a layer2 vlan to reach hosts on the internal network. We have created a new zone for this interface so it can have its own rules and inspection etc. I was having issues getting some rules to the DHCP and DNS servers working and I didn't see anything hitting the allow or deny rules for the zone Secure --> Trust. I turned on logging for the implicit deny all and noticed the traffic was getting blocked there because it was showing up as Secure--->Untrust. Traffic from the Secure zone does not use the forwarding table for our internal network and tries to go through the default external 0.0.0.0 route to the internet. I had to create a PBF rule in order to send this through the main LAN interface eth1/1 to the next hop there 10.1.9.2. This is causing issues in failover as the LAN IP changes and the PBF rule stops working. For normal traffic this works fine as the HA firewall takes over with all the same interface configs and sees the internal network on 10.1.9.3 and forwards accordingly. The intra-vlan traffic for hosts on the Secure zone work fine, traffic flows out eth1/2.  I looked at the forwarding table and all the 10.1 network is there and known via eth1/1.  I don't understand why it ignores the forwarding table and just uses the default route. Anyone have any experience or insight on this? I have attached a diagram below.    \n\nI have thought of a couple solutions, but I'd like to know if this is a bug or something I don't understand with the PA zones. One solution would be to set up HSRP on the routers but we would have to re run the lan cables to the core and to the routers as well to get them on a layer 2 vlan. The other was use the same IP on both routers without HSRP. It causes some issues with OSPF and needed some static routes to help in failover but it works. Any help is appreciated.    \n     \n      \n[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/1diaJEZ.jpg)    \n    \n    \n**UPDATE - Issue resolved itself mysteriously. Disabled the PBF to grab some more captures and traffic continued to route correctly. Palo Alto support also replied that it seemed everything was configured correctly and wanted to do live capture but I was unable as the issue was gone when I was prepping for the call.**    \n\n",

At the moment I have what will become the core/distro layer (Stack of four meraki ms 425) connected to the current Cisco Nexus core. What I've noticed is that some traffic to a vlan interface that's configured on the Nexus fails and when I check I find incomplete arp entries for those devices, mainly printers. The connection goes from printer to Meraki MS Access SW then to Meraki 425 stack over 10G fiber, then to Nexus over a 10G uplink between MS 425 and Nexus.\n\nI got around that by moving the vlan interface to the MS425. So no more problems for devices having to reach the Nexus anymore, the interface is on the Meraki 425 so no need to hit the old core for gateway.\n\nNow, what I'm noticing is the same problem from switches that are directly connected to the Nexus. In this case there is one extra switch: printer | desktop switch (cisco) | meraki access | nexus | meraki 425 stack.\n\nI'm assuming that moving this last MS access switch to the Meraki will fix the problem, but I still can't figure out why this happens. Why are printers on this vlan not able to hit their gateway?",

Most connectivity has been from the greater NY/NJ area with further options from Hibernia near Boston... so it's nice to see another path emerge with great separation.  Does anyone know if any service providers were in the consortium or have spectral capacity?",

I'm the only networking person on the team/whole company\n\nOr\n\n2.)  I'm the most knowledgeable in the shop, and everyone's go to for simple problems/reminding people of the same commands for the 3rd-4th time in a row.\n\nI had a coworker ask me other day \"how do you know all this?\"  My response was \"I read books and watched videos.\"\n\nHis response was \"psh, no thanks, I have a life.\"\n\nI tried explaining to him if he ever wanted to get better at all this and work his way up, he'd need to invest some amount of time and energy studying and learning outside of work hours, to which he just kept rolling his eyes.\n\nSometimes I question if I'm doing my career any favors not having a mentor.  Do you think it'd be worth trying to go somewhere where I'd be the dumbest person in the room with the most to learn?  Somewhere like a large MSP or ISP, or VAR.  And how easy is it to jump from enterprise to that realm?\n\nI do currently have \"architect\" in my job title where I work now, and make a really good salary (to the point I'd have to take a pay cut to go anywhere) but I kind of crave working with people who actually care about networking and improving their skills and staying current.  Somewhere where they all have an alphabet soup full of certs and knowledge and I'd be one of the dumbest people in the room.\n\nThoughts?  Hopefully this won't be considered early career advice and be deleted.\n\n",
