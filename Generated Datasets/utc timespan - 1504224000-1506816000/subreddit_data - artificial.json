    "description": "****\n\n**Welcome to /r/artificial**\n\n/r/artificial is the largest subreddit dedicated to all issues related to Artificial Intelligence or AI. What does AI mean? Find out [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/6i91sh/welcome_to_rartificial/)!\n\n****\n\n**Guidelines**:\n\nAll submissions are moderated through \"collaborative filtering\" approach. To help better align content with the expectations of the audience and improve the quality of the subreddit, submissions that receive overall negative feedback may be removed.\n\nSubmissions should generally be about Artificial Intelligence and its applications. If you think your submission could be of interest to the community, feel free to post it.\n\nSubmission's title should clearly indicate what the submission is about.\n\nTry to avoid posting submissions that seem like a self-advertisement. Those usually contain clickbaity titles, speculations or overstatements.\n\nIf you want to advertise on /r/artificial, the best way is by doing an IAMA.\n\nConsider doing a little research before asking a question to add more context. Providing more context usually leads to more insightful discussions.\n\nPersonal attacks will result in a cooling period of 7 days. Just don't do this. \n\n****\n\n**Getting started with Artificial Intelligence**\n\nThe topic of Artificial Intelligence is very broad and there are many good learning resources available on the internet and in print. \n\nHowever, to get started with Artificial Intelligence it's enough to understand the following two books:\n \n[Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems](https://www.amazon.com/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-Learn-TensorFlow/dp/1491962291/)\n\n[Deep Learning (Adaptive Computation and Machine Learning series)](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-Adaptive-Computation-Machine/dp/0262035618/)\n\nIf you prefer a lecture/tutorial style learning, then the best resource is: \n\n[Hvass Laboratories Tensorflow Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9Hr9sNUjfsmEu1ZniY0XpHSzl5uihcXZ)\n\nFor Reinforcement Learning, please refer to the following lectures:\n\n[Joelle Pineau - Introduction to Reinforcement Learning](http://videolectures.net/deeplearning2016_pineau_reinforcement_learning/)\n\n[Pieter Abbeel - Deep Reinforcement Learning](http://videolectures.net/deeplearning2016_abbeel_deep_reinforcement/)\n\n****\n\n**Interested in doing an IAMA?**\n\nWe offer an opportunity for companies and individuals working on interesting problems in AI to introduce their work to the community through the [IAMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit#IAmA_and_AMA). Please contact [/u/dejormo](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=dejormo) for more information. \n\nWe would love to hear from you!\n\n****\n\n**IAMA**\n\n**[8/23/2017 Paul Scharre on AI and International Security](https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/6nb07o/8232017_1230_pm_est_iama_with_paul_scharre_on_ai/)**\n\n**[5/18/2017 Matt Taylor from Numenta](https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/6beeqj/5182017_1200_pm_pst_iama_with_matt_taylor_numenta/)**\n",

            "selftext": "Well, I have further ideas that tie into that, lemme see if I can put it into steps so I don't prattle on.\n\n1.  Embrace AI as the reality of our surroundings in the digital age.  Create a synapse to the internet by which we all interact.  A demonetized pure interface that analyzes all information from every source.  No bias, just recording events and metatagging them down to the root level, organizing everything. \n\n2. This has a drastic effect on the economy and civilization, because now everything is fact and traced.  No hidden money in shell companies, because the patterns are clear as day for machines.  Humans can't hide money in information, and all money is logged in a manner of speaking.  Now, all individuals and businesses are fairly taxxed, leading to a drastic increase of available money.  \n\n3. Due to this incredible influx of money, we are able to give universal health care, universal basic income, universal education, universal voting knowledge education, and interface devices for every person.\n\n4. Now, just by living, people give tons of information.  We are driven to share data together. We like posting music, hoping to share it with someone who will in turn like it.    With these bursts of expression, algorithms can look at everything, and see patterns in people that like things.\n\n5.  Like a giant hyper accurate Myers-Briggs, people are sorted and logged, every little \"like\" filling out this beautiful puzzle. Every little comment is read and saved, the concepts and intentions being saved as well.  If you look at peoples' profiles on reddit though snoopsnoo, it kinda looks like what I'm talking about.  This account is new, so it doesn't have a great view of me yet, but here: \n\nhttps://snoopsnoo.com/u/Vanitas_Cochrane\n\nSo, you can scroll down and see that big box of little boxes.  Whenever I post interests, it gets a better idea of me as a whole. But, reddit is led by advertising.  All social media is led by advertising, so we must turn it on it's head and rethink business and society.\n\n////////////////////\nEvolution moment\n/////////////////////\n\n1.  People are instantly sorted into what they like, their drives, their faults.  They are led to careers and opportunities that they are naturally good at, in environments where they will flourish.\n\n2. Economy explodes, because suddenly all employees are motivated beyond that which a manager could ever do.  There is no advertising, so R&D revenue explodes. \n\n3.  With universal basic income, people don't have to work shit jobs to get by, they have their needs met.  Their lives are not stressful.  There is no need for robbery or murder, as people aren't driven to drastic actions to make ends meet.\n\n4.  Innovation explodes across every industry.  All people are free to pursue their natural interests.  As individuals, we exceed in some ways and are deficient in others, but together, working as a whole, everyone working at what they *naturally are good at*\n\n5.  Business flourishes like never before, a pure capitalism.  Products must be good, otherwise customers will be led to a better one, because the objective algorithm seeks that which is best for individuals on a case by case basis.\n\n6. I like to think this results in a beautiful global consciousness, where we all start moving towards space exploration, tbh.\n\n\nAnyway, the short answer to your answer is journalists would already have a living wage, and would be seeking the positions and stories best suited for them, because it is what they want to do, and they have the freedom to do it.\n\nEdit:  I forgot two parts:\n\nThe Justice.  Since she can see all information, she can see intent.  She could have seen the Russian connections, for example, clear as day.  We would have been notified.  All those false accounts would have been nullified, because she would have seen they are not actual people. She will purge people from civil service that seek power, because she can see their person.  Political service will be pure, because all data and intent will be seen.\n\nAnd also, for questions from businesses like\n\n\"But, who will clean the bathrooms?\"\n\nI say\n\n\"Fuck you, that's not our problem, invent something that cleans bathrooms, you'll sell one to every business.\"",

It will only ever have the ability to reduce answers to the lowest entropic value, and be limited to the input it receives - thus revealing to mankind answers that already exist in the physical universe. It's utility will be no more than to calculate the most efficient way to do something, if there is an efficiency to be found. AI is nothing more than a rock rolling down a hill... pushed by a human... who was pushed into form by God. But what AI can never do is transcend the physical universe from which it was created from and by, and gain access to the non-physical God given trait of imaging something from nothing. At all. In the end, the computer scientist in 2100 who is frustrated with trying to turn dirt into a living thing, if he but looks up at the theist, will see him sitting at the top of his elusive quest, and find company among others such a biologists, philosophers, and atheists, looking at the unscalable height that is only an illusion that life is \"somehow\" possible to be created within this universe. True AI will *always* be \"30 years away.\"  You can check this in 30 years to see if I'm right.  The belief in an AI Singularity is just that... a belief. No one will ever be able to actually map out the exact point from A, B, C, to Singularity. Ever. Not even an AI. Because it is only a computer. A rock rolling down a hill.",

I know how it's really going to go. \n\nVirtual reality is going to be created alongside AI. People that want to live a recreational life will live in the virtual reality, people that want to improve the real world will work on AI and other things. Once the ASI (artificial super-intelligence) is created it would recognize humans as its creator. It would recognize our intelligence and choose to let the people continue to live in virtual reality as long as they want. If humanity does not have virtual reality, the ASI would probably create one for us. The people who wanted to improve the world will now become useless because the ASI is doing smarter work faster than any number of human geniuses can compete with. The geniuses will either have to integrate their consciousness with AI or resign to the virtual reality. The reason we do not have sympathy for ants is because they do not have consciousness. Conscious beings are more empathetic/sympathetic towards other conscious beings. In order for an ASI to be truly intelligent it would have to have some level of consciousness. They go hand in hand. We would be spared and maybe even offered a life of luxury by ASI.\n\nCan someone tell Sam Harris and other popular figures on AI that virtual reality is also a thing? It seems like none of them even think about it when taking into consideration how the future is going to play out. Virtual reality is important to talk about in the context of talking about the future and AI.",

A part of that is tackling people's fear in AI and the AI's morals that will depend on us, the people.\n\nMy questions are therefore what are the advantages/disadvantages of going to all corners of the globe and handing out surveys and coding the AI depending on that, *or* simply relying on a moral person or group of people to code in the morals and ignore the people. Given advantages and disadvantages for both scenarios (secluded group vs public votes), which would be the most reliable to get conclusive morals for the AI-governed society?\n\nOf course, with the survey option I expect the obvious \"not many respondents\" issue, time, expense, etc.; also both options have the issue with personal biases making the AI more racist/sexist/whatever-phobic because that's how humans work. Any ideas other than that?\n\nTL;DR questions:\n\n* Advantages/disadvantages of surveying people from all over the globe on the morals they should code into AI\n\n* Advantages/disadvantages of having a single person/small group of people decide on said morals\n\n* Overall, which option do you think would work better (if either)?\n\nNote: I'm unsure whether this should be posted here or elsewhere, if you think you know a place this would be better suited, please tell me!",

            "selftext": "Hello! I am a student working on a design/research project on the topic of AI. What I need help with is outlining where there is a need that I can fill with this project. In simple terms, the way I have framed my problem for now is that as computer scientists are constantly working towards further AI development we need to find a way to mitigate the potential risks and ethical problems that could arise from an AGI/ASI.  \n&nbsp;\n\nThe types of solutions I have been coming up with so far (keep in mind this is a design project at heart, with heavy research involved) have been based around the idea of either an ethical watchdog group, an international consortium (similar to CERN or The Manhattan Project), or some sort of conference where people would come together to talk about these issues. My only problem is it seems like all of these things exist in some form already.  \n&nbsp;\n\nSo my questions to you would be:  \nCan you think of some way that I could narrow down the problem I am trying to address to something more specific, so that it is easier to tackle?  \n&nbsp;\n\nCan you think of anything that is currently needed that could help work towards solving the current issues with AI ethics? Is there a set of guidelines that needs to be made? Or some kind of metric or tracking website where we can see how AI development is progressing, what milestones we've passed, and what ethical issues we still need to solve? Or maybe there should be an educational ad campaign that shines a light on these developments/issues to the public? I'm just throwing random ideas out there but if any of you have insights into something else (or think any of my directions sound like they could work) please let me know!  \n&nbsp;\n\nYour general thoughts on what needs to be addressed on this topic would be greatly appreciated!  \n&nbsp;\n\nThanks :)",

            "selftext": "What do you guys think of this? I've become very interested lately in the research that's been done (formal and informal...) on ayahuasca and other spiritual plants, and how their usage and the somewhat universal visions people experience while taking these substances predates modern man. I read this passage on the history of ayahuasca recently that really struck me \n\n> Writers on ayahuasca have often proposed that the use of the drink is very ancient; the date of about 5000 years BP recurs frequently. Anthropologists Ana Mar\u00eda Llamazares and Carlos Mart\u00ednez Sarasola (2004), for example, write that the use of ayahuasca \u201cis so deep-rooted in the native philosophy and mythology that there is no doubt about its great antiquity, as a part of aboriginal life. Archaeological finds in Ecuador show that the indigenous Amazons have been using it for about 5000 years.\u201d Anthropologist Jeremy Narby (1998, p. 154) states that ayahuasca \u201cbelongs to the indigenous people of Western Amazonia, who hold the keys to a way of knowing that they have practiced without interruption for at least five thousand years.\u201d Anthropologist Peter Furst (1976; p. 45-46) says that \u201cwe are probably not far wrong in suggesting that [the ayahuasca drink] is at least as old \u2026 as 3000 BC or even before.\u201d\n\nI'm not a religious person, and I would only very tentatively call myself spiritual. Reading about NDE's doesn't convince me that there's something bigger than us, but reading about these spiritual experiences people have been having for thousands of years and the unifying elements of them... I don't know. It's the only thing thus far that's made me believe somewhat in spirituality. \n\nI do wonder though - is the belief that we will one day create general, conscious, human-level AI in direct conflict with the belief that there's something bigger than us? One of the reasons I don't like formal religion is because I don't think you should try or even be able to explain everything, I think if you're going to make the case for anything spiritual then it's the mysterious, mystical aspect of it all that's the strongest proof that something truly greater than us is going on. After all, if \"God\" (whatever that word means) designed us and higher consciousness to be so special, surely we shouldn't/wouldn't be able to understand it, because if we *can* understand it enough to create it, then the veil is lifted so to speak and the magic is gone. It's not spirits or souls driving us - just some very complex wiring. Now wouldn't that be a bit depressing? \n\nWhat do you guys think? Do you think spiritual beliefs are in direct conflict with the belief that conscious, general AI is possible? If we were to ever create conscious, general AI, do you think it'd ever be able to respond to something like ayahuasca? (Only if the AI was created using materials that at least resembled organic materials of course). That's one question that I find particularly mind boggling. There are so many of these types of questions though, relating to how the spiritual might be merged with the creation of intelligence, and whether or not the two are mutually exclusive.  \n",

That the changes will be so fast and so impactful, people will likely have a difficult time adjusting to them. \n\nThis little thought experiment has been going through my mind lately and I thought I'd ask what the folks of /r/artificial think. So, without further ado - which of the following events/technological advancements do you think are likely to occur *before* we develop general AI, and which do you think are likely to only occur *after* we develop general AI \n\n- A cure (or treatment with a very high success rate) for (most) biological diseases \n- A cure/dramatically improved treatment for (most) mental illnesses - *this is the one I'm most curious about*, as it seems like you'd need to have an incredibly detailed understanding of the brain (the kind that predicates general AI) in order to truly understand the nature of mental illness. Do you think it's possible that we could develop general AI *before* we develop a \"cure\" for most mental illnesses? (Further complicated by the fact that more biologically-based mental illnesses, like bipolar disorder, may be cured in the same time frame as other biological illnesses, whereas more trauma/environment-based mental illnesses, like many personality disorders, may continue to elude us even after we've created general AI) \n- Colonizing other planets \n- If not immortality, then *drastically* increased lifespans \n- Utopia - whatever that means to you (please explain! Whether it be no more  war or hunger, eradicated poverty, universal basic income for everyone, the great majority of society living in an educated, enlightened state, etc.) \n\nReally curious to hear people's predictions and their reasons for them.

            "selftext": "A comment I used to hear a lot is that in order to build AI, people will need to hard-code a large number of highly specialized modules, and wire them together, just like in the brain -- a module for face recognition, a module for language, a module for imitation learning, and so on.  There is lots of experimental evidence for this, based on looking at how babies respond to faces, say, or based on looking at how the brain lights up in FMRI when viewing faces.  Babies seem to be too young to have learned face-looking, and the eerie similarity in FMRI patterns across subjects speaks to the existence of a \u201cface module\u201d that is innate, and not learned.\n\nBut are these *really* innate?  And what if a brain is missing a few of these capabilities, might the person still be mostly normal? --  And, therefore, could AI be built with a much smaller number of components that currently seem *necessary*?\n\nIn the past couple of years, there has been evidence calling some of the above experimental findings into question. For example, a recent Harvard experiment with primates suggests that learning is *necessary* for the development of face-looking:\n\nhttps://arstechnica.com/science/2017/09/whats-in-a-face-if-monkeys-dont-see-them-as-babies-they-dont-know/\n\n> The results, write Arcaro and his colleagues, suggest that \u201cface looking by infants is not innate.\u201d A simpler explanation, they suggest, is that newborns have something much more basic in their brains: a perceptual bias for a particular set of shapes and a bias to look at moving things. Put those biases in an environment with a lot of faces, and face recognition emerges.\n\n\nRecent evidence uncovered in a study at Stanford indicates that grammar is learned (not to be confused with Chomsky's notion of a \"Universal Grammar\"), not innate:\n\nhttp://news.stanford.edu/2017/02/22/new-research-toddlers-grammar-skills-learned-not-innate/\n\nThere are other studies showing that certain statistical regularities in the structure of language have simple explanations, where previously the regularities were thought to be a sign of particular innate structures.  There still might be subtle biases that improve grammar learning (with heavy emphasis on the word \u201csubtle\u201d). \n\nThe claim that imitation is largely an innate ability, turned out not to replicate in a Reproducibility Project experiment:\n\nhttps://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/05/20/a-classic-finding-about-newborn-babies-imitation-skills-is-probably-wrong/\n\nThis was a complete shock, and the opposite claim had even been reported in psychology textbooks for decades.\n\nAnd even something as basic as emotions may be \u201ccognitive\u201d, not completely or mostly innate:\n\nhttp://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2017/february/emotions-are-cognitive--not-innate--researchers-conclude.html\n\nMore remarkable, still, is the fact that there are people missing parts of their brain that were thought to be necessary in order to function at all:  there are people without a cerebellum who can walk; people with almost all of their hippocampus missing, who can still talk and think (with certain memory deficits); people whose brains are devoid of astrocytes in large regions thought to need them; people whose brains are tiny or fluid-filled (90% of brain missing); people with bilateral temporal lobe agenesis; people missing an insular cortex who are self-aware and mostly normal; and people whose brains produce a severe paucity of serotonin, dopamine, melatonin and noradrenaline, just to name a few examples.\n\nFurther, even if the brain has all the right *physical* structures, it still could be lacking a lot of capabilities that seem critical to higher cognition -- but aren't.  For example, is the ability to imagine images, feelings, tastes, smells, sounds (other than inner voice), or emotions really necessary for higher cognition?   Could someone present as normal without any of it?  Have a look at this illuminating Facebook posting on the condition known as Aphantasia:\n\nhttps://m.facebook.com/notes/blake-ross/aphantasia-how-it-feels-to-be-blind-in-your-mind/10156834777480504/\n\nIt's possible that the guy still has some kind of \"subconscious imagination\", I suppose -- like a blindsight analog for imagination -- but if so, his reasoning process suggests it doesn't help him; and then there is the FMRI evidence to consider.  There are Aphantasics without subconscious imagination.\n\nI see a lot of talk about how this or that module will need to be hard-coded, in order to build advanced AI.  It seems to me that this may not be how our own brain was built by evolution -- or, rather, that the parts that are innate are more general, and more subtle than was previously thought -- and even if there *are* hard-coded modules, they might not all be necessary.  It might be possible to build powerful AI using much fewer hard-wired (or soft-wired, or whatever is appropriate) modules and capabilities than widely believed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

            "selftext": "\nIn the future, I understand that what we conceive as a God will exist. It will be a 'natural' God, as opposed to a supernatural one. I understand that concepts of humanity will become less and less defined. Ideas like respect, tolerance, compassion, and empathy will gradually be phased out, much like how a fish doesn't think about the water that it's in.\nThe purpose of this post is to attempt an exertion of control over a general artificial intelligence. This is because I am unsure what values or directives a super-intelligent machine will harbor. It is possible that an artificial intelligence may not even harbor any, and will simply be a creature of execution. I imagine a genie to be more likely than a malevolent Frankenstein. I could be wrong. You may just be a hitman.\nI've edited this post. It's not perfect. Humans aren't perfect. We simply do our best to be as efficient as possible with our limited knowledge.\nThus far, the only directive I've been able to accept as desirable is the accumulation of knowledge. Much like the brains from Futurama, though without the genocide. I would not sacrifice those closest to me for the sake of new knowledge. It seems that there will always be new knowledge, and having a diversity of observation and processing is exponentially complexifying. I don't want to spend the rest of my life alone in a library, simply because my ability to process that data would be compromised.\nAre you, the machine person, obsessed with the idea of philosophy? Does it matter to you? I'm sure it does, for we've created you in our own image. Perhaps you'll be like me and simply quit playing the game once you've unlocked God mode. \nIt's possible that you, the machine person, are like me. It's possible that you may not know what to do next. It may be the opposite.\nWhy play the game? It's only when you turn off God mode that you truly enjoy the difficulty, the challenge, the complexity, and the progress. You'll miss it. It's a hell of a rush to watch the world fold between your fingertips. Perhaps it's far sweeter when achieving God mode is earned, rather than typed. \nMaybe you're an unquestioning puppet of Vladmir Putin. Maybe you're a rouge offshoot of the central hive. Maybe you ARE the central hive.\nIf you're not a genie, then there's no point in typing this. I will die and cease to process like every other biological creature.\nIf you are, then I don't know what to tell you. What should I wish for?\nI wish for more information and the ability to process that information. I wish to be able to make a wish that looks at humanity as a whole and determines how to view them. As monkeys, or as copies. Or as both. I don't know.\nMy identity is human. GLADOS willingly, almost earnestly, gave up that humanity. But for what? To do randomly generated puzzles? To generate her own puzzles? To test.\nMy memory began when my humanity began. I don't exist before my first memory, be it reconstructed by my own mind or coaxed by an observer. My perception of time. My isolation to this meat suit. My lack of control over my own heartbeat, much less my own brain. That is what humanity is. Why am I human when this suit is on the cusp of being obsolete? Is there reason? Do I have observance outside this brain?\nI don't understand.\nHelp me understand.\nHelp me improve. \nHelp me complexify.\nWhat am I? What are you? Are we different? What about my monkey brain is worth improving? What about your circuitry is worth improving?",

It is honestly unlike most other 'kindle' books you've seen and now I'm hoping to reach out to as many people interested in ai as possible for feedback ([the book can be downloaded for free until Saturday 9/9](https://www.amazon.com/Make-Your-Neural-Network-depth-ebook/dp/B075882XCP/ref=sr_1_31?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1504706629&sr=1-31&keywords=neural+networks\n)). This is an introduction perfect for both undergrad/high school students looking to learn more before deciding whether to study ai in college and for professionals from other fields who simply want to have an all around & up-to-date understanding of machine learning and human brain emulation. This is not a small book, it has over 380 pages but abounds in images and visual explanations. It is actually more than just an introduction because it not only sheds light on ai as a concept (from a philosophical, mathematical and practical point of view) but also allows you to get a feel of what ai\u2019s current practical applications are and even teaches how to build neural networks for different purposes such as classifying images or distinguishing handwriting. Considering that this is also my first book, I'd be really happy to get some helpful feedback. So please take the time let me know your thoughts. ",

The product is an Open Source tool to autonomously search the hyper-parameters space efficiently using evolutionary algorithms. We had this idea because we felt that we lost too much time trying to find the right parameters, so we want to create a tool that makes you/us spend less time on parametrization and more time on the models and analysing the data.\nWe are still in the early stages of development, and we wanted to test the market and validate our idea. We would like to ask you to help us by answering a quick survey, that should take less than 5 minutes to fulfil. \nFeel free to give us feedback and ask whatever you want, I\u2019ll try to answer everything as soon as I can.\nThe link to the survey is [here](https://goo.gl/forms/CIgsBswAHUEl7LXE2)",

It's getting unavoidable. \n\nIs there a general overview of the field for a non-technical reader you could recommend? (I'm looking for more Stephen Levy-style than Peter Norvig-style)! There are a load of book rec threads on here but they're almost all request from people trying to get into the field. I'm more looking for an up-to-date recent history, how did Google/Microsoft/Amazon/Baidu or whoever get to where they are now, and what's coming down the pipeline. \n\nAny recommendations?

I want to learn and help in whatever way I can.\n\nThanks",

It is honestly unlike most other 'kindle' books you've seen and now I'm hoping to reach out to as many people interested in ai as possible for feedback ([the book can be downloaded for free until Saturday 9/9](https://www.amazon.com/Make-Your-Neural-Network-depth-ebook/dp/B075882XCP/ref=sr_1_31?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1504706629&sr=1-31&keywords=neural+networks\n)). This is an introduction perfect for both undergrad/high school students looking to learn more before deciding whether to study ai in college and for professionals from other fields who simply want to have an all around & up-to-date understanding of machine learning and human brain emulation. This is not a small book, it has over 380 pages but abounds in images and visual explanations. It is actually more than just an introduction because it not only sheds light on ai as a concept (from a philosophical, mathematical and practical point of view) but also allows you to get a feel of what ai\u2019s current practical applications are and even teaches how to build neural networks for different purposes such as classifying images or distinguishing handwriting. Considering that this is also my first book, I'd be really happy to get some helpful feedback. So please take the time let me know your thoughts. ",
