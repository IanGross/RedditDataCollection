Validation failed, missing marketing banner  fixed that then re-validate wait another 10-20 minutes\n2. Icon has alpha channels, fixed that then re-validate the app\n3. Now it complain that I need to have all orientations enable for  an Universal build, this is our 3-4 release never been an issue. (found a workaround for that, not elegant but allowed me to get pass this hurdle)\n4. Missing 120x120, 1024x1024 icons, what the heck is that? option is not even in Appicon yet.\n\nHere is my problem: Why doesn't validation point out everything that is wrong all at once? This is utterly insane.\n\nFYI using Xcode 9, then I go to the store somehow my build is there so I tried to submit.\nNow I need to change my title as suddenly it is too big even thought it was fine before.\nTry saving, now complains about my Appicons fixed\nTried to upload a video now it complain that video has no audio fixed that and tried again.\nnow complains that my preview is too short, fixed that\nnow it complains that my preview is too long, WTF why wouldn't Apple say something like this in the first place: \"Your app previous must be between 15 and 30 seconds long\" not hard to do that.\n\nMy point is that the whole process is pretty much insane and takes about the whole day to submit an app for review.\n\nI been working on this since yesterday and part of me things that there must be a better way. Am I doing something wrong?\n\nDo others love/hate submitting apps to the apple Appstore as well? I want to be excited about my releases, but this process is super painful and very annoying.\n\nSorry for for the rambling.\nedit: grammar\n",

However, this trend of anywhere from 50 - 100 downloads per day strictly from china (close to 0 attention from all other countries), has continued for over 6 weeks, with the weeks prior to this garnering close to 0 attention from china. Also, as with the previous thread mentioned, there is no trend with any other data (that is to say, impressions/sessions per day has stayed around 0), and the \"average opt-in rate\" has gone down to 0%, thanks to all these downloads from china.\n\nSo, does anyone have any info on this? Is this 100% (or essentially 100%), guaranteed to be just bots giving the app fake downloads? I don't mind either way, I've just been itching for quite a while to know whats really going on.",

I applied a UILabel using StoryBoard. \n\nIf I don't apply any constraints: \nThe UILabel appears fine and has its exact position as shown on the storyboard. \n\nIf I do apply constraints (e.g. just centering the label vertically and horizontally in container): \n1. The label respects the constraints on the storyboard, and I see all of the constraints listed under the constraint section in the document outline. \n2. However, in the simulator, the label goes into the top left of the cell (0,0 origin), and when I check to see which constraints it has using the debugger, it has no constraints (other than the default standard height and width).\n\nHas anyone else experienced this? Is this an Xcode8 bug? Any other things that may be causing this? \n\nI've tried using the layoutIfNeeded() method in my cellForRow function, but without any success. Also, my tableheaderview also has labels and constraints that I made on storyboard, but I didn't have any issues there. ",

The timestamps are within the possible timeframe of the crime.\nBut there is no way that suspect has been on all these locations within 10 seconds as they are miles apart.\nAs i understand it the directory /AFC Service/ is the \"Apple File Conduit Service\" that exchanges localy stored data with iCloud or iTunes. in this case the following paths seem to indicate, that this is about \"PhotoData\"...\nmy guess would be that this is a log of an upload of pictures taken with the phone. the timestamps are from the upload time. the GPS coordinates are from the EXIF info of the picture. but that is just a random guess...\nDoes anybody actually know how this database is created and when it is changed?

I would like this project to be as open as possible, so therefore I will be asking you guys what features you want included!\n\nComment below what you would like to be included, and any other ideas you have!\n\nI am really looking forward to building this project, as I hope you will be to download it once its released.

They asked me if I could show them how to manage testers themselves. They don't and won't have access to the source code so I presume they mean they want to try to do this via TestFlight.

I've got the following piece I'd like to unwrap:\n\n    {\n     \"items\": [\n      {\n       \"snippet\": {\n        \"thumbnails\": {\n         \"default\": {\n          \"url\": \"https://www.google.com\"\n         }\n        }\n       }\n      }\n     ]\n    }\n\nNow I get this by using a google API call and it returns this. What is the best way to extract the url property? Previously I've been using a series of nested \"if lets\" to get it out but it's fairly messy with all the optionals and I luck myself through it. I've seen some ways to map \"codable\" or something like that but haven't succeeded.\n\nIf you could have a crack or point me in a good direction I'd appreciate it a lot!\n\nEDIT: Thanks to the commenters, Swift 4 give some nice mappings with Codable/Decodable. The below is the code that I got the url out with. Might help you. Also might wanna do some error checks too, but I'm happy with this so far.\n\n    struct ItemService: Decodable {\n        let items : [item]\n        struct item : Decodable {\n            let snippet : snippetStruct\n            struct snippetStruct : Decodable {\n                let thumbnails : thumbnailsStruct\n                struct thumbnailsStruct : Decodable {\n                    let `default` : defaultStruct\n                    struct defaultStruct : Decodable {\n                        let url : String\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    \n    let jsonData = x.data(using: .utf8)!\n    let decoder = JSONDecoder()\n    let beer = try! decoder.decode(ItemService.self, from: jsonData)\n    print(beer.items[0].snippet.thumbnails.default.url)",

            "selftext": "Hey everyone. I've posted this question quite a few times on S.O but i dont seem to be getting a reaction on it. It might be that i'm not formulating it properly but i've kinda hit a wall and i'd like to try and see if anyone might have any suggestions. Here goes.\n\n---------------\n\nNormally tables are easy to manage , especially since autolayout can do most of the heavy lifting to determine cell sizes and so on. However, there are cases where things become a little bit more tricky like having a table of polls.\n\nA poll in this case consists of labels with variable description lengths, images with varying sizes and a set of options for the user to choose from ( a nested table essentially ).\n\n**----Approach 1------**\n\nBreak each poll into a number of cells\n\n[Example1][1]\n\n**Pros**: \nIts easy to add more fields to a poll in the future, layout is easier to handle for a single cell for each element especially in the case of the nested table. If you need to fall back to manually calculating the size of a specific cell you can do it while keeping everything else on automatic.\n\n**Cons**:\nIf you have multiple polls you need to keep track which cell corresponds to which poll, and you generally need to do some arithmetic to keep track of whats what.\n\n **----Approach 2-----**\n\nHave the poll that contains all these elements be one big cell and set the constraints between them appropriately.\n\n[Example2][2]\n\n**Pros**:\nIts easy to implement, maps your model to your cell in a one to one fashion without having to multi-demultiplex your data.\n\n**Cons**:\nAutolayout can get hairy with nested tables. For example, for the height of the cell in this case, i used to return UITableViewAutomaticDimension until i realised this wont cut it as a nested table exists that could be any kind of size. Its quite straightforward to calculate the contentsize of the nested table, however, this would mean you would have to calculate ALL of the other elements as well as now you're returning a specific height and not automatic. Your job has become that much harder.\n\n**----Outro----**\n\nHow do you approach issues like that? Approach 1, 2 or something entirely different? I've simplified the structure of the elements here to make things a bit more readable, there's more arcane stuff involved like shadowed views containing the elements you see to create the illusion of a floating card etc.\n\nThanks everyone.\n\n*P.S : If there's already an answer about this somewhere please point me towards that, i just haven't found much on this yet. Hopefully this post can spark some discussion on the matter and help other people in my shoes.*\n\n---------------------\n\nThe S.O question can be found here:  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46400229/how-to-structure-complicated-table-elements if you need it for some reason\n\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/gClmvm.png\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/BfVaom.png",

            "selftext": "I have been dabbling with Objective-C and Swift for years now, but I am just now actually working towards my first production app. I have elected to use multiple Storyboards to create my app's user-interface. I like using multiple Storyboards for separation of concerns (e.g. Sign On/Registration, Settings / Preferences, Main flow, etc.).\n\nSo, for example, after the user taps the \"Log In\" button, I want to present an entirely new Storyboard. This is no problem thanks to `UIStoryboard.instantiateInitialViewController()` and presenting that view controller with `self.present(_:animated:completion)`. However, I noticed that my `LogInViewController` is never de-initialized.\n\nI believe that this makes sense be cause the `LogInViewController` is never dismissed so `UIWindow.keyWindow.rootViewController` still holds a strong reference to the `LogInViewController`. I can set the `UIWindow.keyWindow.rootViewController` to my new View Controller and `LogInViewController` is de-initialized. This seems to further confirm my theory.\n\nThis concept, however, brings me to a much larger question. It's my understanding that `self.present(_:animated:completion)` is the standard way to present a new View Controller. If that's the case, doesn't that mean every View Controller in the entire app will be held in memory indefinitely unless they are explicitly dismissed? Is there a more proper way to present a view controller that prevents this issue?\n\n----\n**An Example**\n\n\nConsider this list of UIViewController operations:\n\nRootViewController\n\n\nPush VC1\n\n\nPush VC2\n\n\nPush VC3\n\n\nModal VC4\n\n\nDismiss VC4\n\n\nPush VC5\n\n\nPush VC6\n\n\nDismiss VC6\n\n\nDismiss VC5\n\nAfter these operations, is it true that VC1, VC2, and VC3 are all still contained in memory? If so, couldn't that in and of itself be considered a memory leak? What if some of those view controllers had instance variables with huge data structures? Is it just the developer's responsibility to understand that view controllers stick around in memory due to the navigation stack -- even without a UINavigationController? \n\n----\n\nI have tested this in a small Xcode project and it seems to be true. This was definitely news to me and makes me feel like I need to be more cautious with view controllers. I understand that we have gigabytes of memory and having a few view controllers sticking around isn't going to get us a memory warning but wasted memory is wasted memory.\n\nAny advice here?",

            "selftext": "Hello fellow iOS nerds,\n\nMy name is Jacob Eiting. I've been doing iOS dev since before it was cool ('08 or so), and the most recent app I built was [Apple's 2014 App of the Year](https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/personal/2014/12/08/meet-apples-iphone-app-of-the-year--elevate/19951673/). </brag>\n\nWhen we were building the in-app purchase subscription system for Elevate, we found it incredibly complicated to implement correctly. We went through multiple iterations, and it probably took us 18 months before we worked out all the bugs and edge cases.\n\nHas anyone else had a similar experience? I feel like we can't be alone. We spent so much time building the subscriptions system instead of improving the product and doing other things beneficial to the business and users. \n\nI'm currently building a service that will greatly simplify the whole process for devs, with a hosted backend that keeps up-to-date track of a user's subscriptions, validates receipts, and gives you tools for tracking churn and other metrics. But most importantly, it lets you get subscriptions up and running in hours not months. It would consist of an iOS Framework that wraps the App Store and server interactions so that you could use subscriptions without even having a backend.\n\nI'm curious to know your thoughts. Is this something you would be interested in? I want to make it easier for devs like us to use subscriptions, because, frankly, its the best way to build good software sustainably in 2017.\n\nFriends forever,\n\nJacob",

However, I don't like this option as it seems to be a crappy architecture.\n\n\nThe final product would be something like this:\n\n- iPhone: tab panel.

It will allow users to communicate with staff, students, and teachers. Also, I am planning to make Groups of all departments. It will be an online app with help of Firebase as backend. That's what i have planned until now. (not a pro dev). I dont have much knowledge about cross-platform apps..\nWhat Frameworks / Tools would be best to achieve the above requirements. I have read about Xamarin - RN etc but i have also heard that cross-platform apps are slower/sloppy ?\n\nWhat are my best options to start from because i am blank at this point. Should i develop native apps for IOS and Android and they will work with firebase ??\n\nI am hoping to get something like this https://imgur.com/a/LKSgI\nThanks, everyone!",

I just don\u2019t know how I would accomplish this. Do they display a minimized view on top of their MiniPlayer view Controller which is then being hidden during the transition?\nIn Apple Music you can see that the miniplayer sort of fades away, while the album cover magically gets resized to the new size on the full sized view. I want to achieve the same effect in my app. \n\nDoes anybody here have a clue and could point me in the right direction?\n\nThanks in advance, have a good day \ud83d\ude0a",

The server app that Apple provides just doesn't work. Luckily [someone else has solved this already](https://www.reddit.com/r/swift/comments/6l80gj/json_problem_in_app_development_with_swifts/).\nI saw this as a feature and got some insight in a python server. Okay.\n\n2. \u201cIn the Attributes inspector, set the image to the gray square image provided in the resources folder for this project.\u201d \nWell, there is no image in the resources folder. That's okay, I made my own.\n\n3. There are no pictures for the different menu items that should come from the server. Okay, I downloaded some pictures and added their names to the menu.json file. Here comes my real problem:\n\nBasically what happens is: I fetch the image from the server and assign it to the imageView.image of the cell with style \"Right Detail\".\nNow I guess everything goes right if the images are the correct size. The ones I downloaded are not.\n\n    MenuController.shared.fetchImage(url: item.imageURL) { (uiImage) in\n                if let uiImage = uiImage {\n                    DispatchQueue.main.async {\n                        if let currentIndexPath = self.tableView.indexPath(for: cell), currentIndexPath != indexPath {\n                            return\n                        } else {\n                            cell.imageView?.image = uiImage\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n\n\nNow the interesting part happens: The image shows squeezed, but as soon as I klick on the cell, it expands.\nWhat is happening here and how can I fix it without manually resizing the pictures?\n\n\n        \n",

Even though he wasn't serious, I kind of want to make it for him for Christmas. Ideally, I'd want it to be something he could access on his iPhone, so I was thinking of taking a stab at making an app. I had a few questions I was hoping someone here could help me with. \n\n-How feasible is this? I found a YouTube channel called CodeWithChris that shows you how to make apps and specifically has a series on making soundboards. I'm a pretty fast learner, and I'm hoping with the tutorials, this will be doable. But still.. I'm pretty much a beginner. I used to make websites when I was a wee lass, so I'm familiar with html and css. I also pretty much juryrigged a wordpress/php page once, but it was really a lot of trial and error and I didn't know what I was doing. That's all I got. So, really, for a beginner, is this even possible?\n\n-Are these programs (swift, xcode are the ones I'm seeing) expensive? \n\n-Is there a way to make an iPhone app that is only accessible to a few people? Or can I put it on the app store for a few days, let him download it and then remove it? \n\n-Dumb question, but do I have to pay Apple? (I've been googling and I can't find figure it out)\n\n-Do you guys have any advice? \n\nThank you so much, and I'm really sorry if this is not the right place to post this. ",

I have the native app, which uses a UIWebView to show a GWT JS application. \n\nHowever, pop-ups are not working in this app for iOS 11. They can open, a value can be selected, and then they will save the value and close, but then they will reopen exactly as they were prior to closing, and this will continue. If I have 2 drop downs, then the first will have the issue described above, but if I then open a second I will see the values from the first drop-down until I have clicked somewhere else on the screen to close it.\n\nThe second time the drop-down comes up it does not automatically close on selection, but does seem to change the value. Additionally, if I close the drop-down without having anything selected then it will pop-up with the same number of items in the list, but all blank, as though the initial pop-up is somehow feeding values into the second pop-up.\n\nI have eliminated the possibility that it is solely a code issue, as the same exact native and web code has the pop-ups working as intended on iOS 11.\n\nI would appreciate any advice on how to deal with this, either because you have experienced this issue yourselves or even just in general issue debugging hints for iOS 11, as this is relatively new to me.\n\nThanks.",

The startup involves a social platform that is accessed only through an iOS mobile application (app only, no website). I've vetted the idea with a few investors and thought-leaders, and I've received very positive feedback. I am looking for an individual who is experienced in iOS development and can build an application end-to-end, submit it to the App Store, etc. This will be a social app where the user interface will be critical, so UI experience is a plus. Although the \"social app\" space is crowded, this app touches on an aspect of the social experience that currently has no competition and is ripe for innovation.\n\nMe: I'm a 30-something year old executive at a technology firm, but do not have any experience in development (outside of management). My primary skillset is sales, sales engineering, IT security/compliance, some networking experience, and executive management and board experience.  I truly believe that if I can team up with a gifted iOS engineer, we can do something awesome.\n\nIf you're interested, DM me with a little information on yourself and your experience! Hope to hear from some of you!\n\n(PS - this is a throw away account)",

While the video is recording, the app is taking screenshots at whatever FPS I set and saving those images to an array\n2. When the video stops recording, it creates a CAKeyframeAnimation with each image's .cgimage using [this code](http://www.mikitamanko.com/blog/2017/05/21/swift-how-to-insert-animated-watermark-into-the-video-or-how-to-merge-two-videos)\n\nThe issues:\n\n1. After a few minutes of recording, it hits a memory limit from the thousands of images I'm storing\n2. After about a minute and a half, it crashes while creating/exporting the video with animations on it. I'm assuming this is from an overload because it only crashes on longer videos?\n\nWhat is the most efficient method to do this? The obvious solution is to limit recordings to <= 1 minute, but this app is intended for much longer videos. I've thought about looping but I would like to at least hit 3-5 minutes per session before I implement that feature.\n\nAre there better storage solutions than an array? Are there smaller things to save besides screenshots of the UIViews? Is there an entirely different approach to this entire thing? I have seen both GPUImage and SCRecorder mention recording custom overlays to the video in real time but I've only found discussions about filters that affect the entire screen. \n\nThanks!",

I'm running through the link's accepted answer's ten troubleshooting steps, but I don't understand any of the provisioning profile aspects. In addition, this answer was written in 2013, which may well have been before automatic management of signing.\n\n*Some notes before my questions: The only Apple ID account that I am signed into on Xcode is enrolled into the Apple Developer Program. I am running Xcode 8.3.3. I am the sole owner of the account (ie. it's not a company account).*\n\n* In the 'Signing' pane of Xcode's project window for my target app, when I tick 'Automatically Manage Signing', Xcode uses my team provisioning profile. Is this setting sufficient for: 1) development; 2) testing of in-app-purchases; and 3) for release to the App Store? Or do I have to switch to Manual at any point?\n\n* In the aforementioned 'Signing' pane, when 'Automatically Manage Signing' is ticked, should I see any options other than my single Apple ID (and of course 'None' and 'Add an account...')? I used to have an option with a phrase like \"(personal team)\" in it, but it seems to be gone now - should I still have this option now that I'm enrolled into the Developer Program?\n\n* When 'Automatically Manage Signing' is ticked, should I be able to select anything other than just 'Automatic' in `Build Settings -> Basic -> Signing -> Provisioning Profile`?\n\n* In the Apple Developer Member Center, I have set up provisioning profiles for development and distribution explicitly for my app id (ie. without a wildcard), yet they are not selected when I tick 'Automatically Manage Signing'. They only appear when signing is manual. Furthermore, should I expect to see my 'iOS Team Provisioning Profile' in the Member Center's 'Profiles' section? I only see the two aforementioned profiles that I manually generated myself; no wildcard profiles, nor a team provisioning profile.\n\n* Is it possible to test in-app purchases without signing out of my iCloud account?\n\n* Is it possible to fully test in-app purchases on iOS Simulator (as of 2017)?\n\nThanks for anything that you can answer (especially if you have any insight on the \"Cannot Connect to iTunes Store\" bug!",

So far I've only learned about the basics (conditionals, if/else, nested ifs) and numbers (integers, creating integer instance, operations on integers, operator shorthand, overflow operations) but the book is huge so I feel like it will take forever to finally get into the app making part. Is learning this way really a good way to learn Swift Programming ? I don't really feel like I'm learning anything and it doesn't seem like it will come in handy for making a app (except the if/else section, that part seems like it's used a lot in almost everything)",

Not much, it plays and organizes podcasts like the others. I personally like the UI of mine over other popular podcast applications (e.g. Overcast), which is why I wrote it. A feature that I like is having everything in a \"Timeline\", which organizes everything by date.\n\nIf you could report crashes, and explain how to reproduce it (I do have Crashlytics included in the app but that is only so helpful), I would appreciate it.\n\nIf you are a UI/UX person, I would love any tips on how to improve the UI!! This is my best attempt, so any pointers would be great.\n\nIf people could use it as their daily driver that would be great. Any features you feel that are must haves would also appreciated since I would like to accommodate as many people as possible.\n\nAny tips from the screenshots would also be appreciated!\n\nPlease PM/Reply your email so I can add you to Testflight.\n\nAny other questions on what it does/how it works are welcome.\n\nThanks!",

That being said having my first and last name on an app released on the App Store page seems less professional than if I had some company sounding name behind them. \n\nI would think getting hired for contract work would be easier if I used a company sounding name instead of my generic first and last name.\n\nOn the other hand if I try to get employed somewhere doing programming would it hurt my perception from the potential company if I have my apps under a company name and not my own? As if I'm trying to run a company on the side while also being employed? Would this cause them to think I wouldn't put my full effort into them if they hired me?\n\nI'm not sure what the right answer is and would love some advice from the veterans here. Thanks.",

            "selftext": "Hello reddit!\n\nI was hoping I could get a code review from the experienced iOS dev\u2019s browsing reddit.  I\u2019d love to elevate my game, and I figured this could be another way to get additional mentorship.\n\n[Project can be downloaded here](https://github.com/dlee923/GIF-2-Table-FULL)\n\nSome feedback I received thus far from another dev, but that I am unable to decipher:\n\n> I found 2 real issues with the code:\n> 1. there are a lot of strong reference loops\n> Mostly for MainVC\n> Basically it\u2019s better to replace \u201cvar mainVC: MainVC?\u201d in all classes that are supposed to be freed with \u201cweak var mainVC: MainVC?\u201d\n> \n> But there are also strong loops between other components and controllers. Adding \u201cweak\u201d for some vars reduced memory consumption growth 2.5 times for me.\n\nTo explain - I was creating this var in supporting class files (mainly view subclasses) in order to gain access to the my main ViewController (mainVC) so that I could pass and send data back and forth.  My understanding is that by not using weak, I am creating a strong reference and so the subclass that is referencing my mainVC class cannot properly deallocate and release memory?  However, adding an optional weak in front of these var\u2019s does not seem to reduce the build up of memory for me when tracking memory usage.  What would I being doing wrong in this instance?\n\n\n> 2. Connected with this same issue\n> It\u2019s even nicer to have delegate references instead of controller MainVC or other controller references, to separate logic. For instance, image cache delegate. It\u2019ll be easier to move delegate logic to separate files if it\u2019ll grow in the future.\n\nI\u2019m not 100% clear on this comment.  Should I be moving my image cache which is currently residing in my mainVC to a separate file that gives it a global scope?  \n\n> That\u2019s what I have by now\n> I think code is very good for the first swift project\n\nWould love to get some insight from you guys.  \nWould also love to know where you guys might rate my iOS abilities on a scale of 1-10 and if I would be ready for a junior level position.  Or in other words.  If you were reviewing me as a candidate for a full time role, what could I do to better stand out.  Would I be a favorable candidate? \n\nThanks reddit!\n\nPS* I realize that my images don't load scaled appropriately.  I was playing around with the SDWebImage library (to get familiar with it) and it removed my original image loading algorithm which does scale properly.",

I know there are plenty of docs on how to compile your own, and I will be, but someone also needs to put together a formal request for HTTP/2 libcurl in the base EL repos, and not being able to support such a major part of a major API would be a prime incentive to get this in.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n[Legacy APN docs](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/BinaryProviderAPI.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008194-CH13-SW1) | [Current APN docs](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/CommunicatingwithAPNs.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008194-CH11-SW1)",

I could then do my processing work once the 2 second segment has finished downloading. For this technique to be plausible I imagine that the video data would have to be synchronous so we don't get random jumbled frames and I have no idea if it is or not.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nLastly this is just for a personal project and out of curiosity more than anything so I don't mind if solutions are a bit \"hacky\" although it would be interesting to see if there is something that would work well in a commercial app.\n\nThanks!\n",

While I am leaning towards the SE given it's attractive price point ($100 cheaper than the 6s), I recognize that there are some hardware advances available on the 6s such as 3d touch, better front-facing camera, etc. that is making me consider spending the extra money on the 6s.\n\nI appreciate the value of designing for the smaller screen, as scaling the UI up an app is probably easier than scaling down. While I do have intentions to stick to creating ARKit apps exclusively, I'm concerned whether I'd change my mind and want to unlock the potential of creating apps that utilize 3d touch more, for instance.\n\n\nLastly, while I am happy with my current Android daily driver, the idea of having the 6s as a potential back up should my Android phone fail on me is slightly appealing. BUT, that's not necessarily a huge factor in my consideration.\n\nWhat do you guys think? How is your experience on programming for the SE or 6s?\n\nI'd really appreciate the kind folks of /r/iOSProgramming on the matter, thank you!",

It seems like it only wants to accept GitHub repos (everything is labeled GitHub...) \n\nHas anyone got BitBucket working successfully with 9? 8 worked flawlessly.\n\nEDIT: Weird, I just kept trying it and eventually it worked. \n\nEDIT2: Ok so I'm not sure if this step is necessary but its the only way I got it to work. I signed in to my GitHub (yes GitHub) account under XCode -> Accounts -> Preferences THEN tried to connect to my BitBucket (yes BitBucket) repo and was able to connect. \n\nVery odd. ",

Emoji glyphs do not seem to be part of any specified font (We are using Roboto) but from this AppleColorEmoji font which seems to be a built in default.    What the hell are you supposed to do?   The only solution I can see is to build a custom Roboto that supplies alternative emoji glyphs, or parse the text and do inline images.  The latter sounds like a type layout nightmare.   Anyone had to deal with this before? also what the hell? If I cant use the emoji don't give them to me??",

Since I've always wanted to do a full layout in code I decided to go ahead and do it with this app. At this point, the app is iPhone (and portrait)-only.\n\nI'm currently going by the following rules when creating a new `UIViewController subclass`:\n\n* If a subview contains its own structure I'll subclass `UIView` and set up the layout in that class' definition. Then I only use the `UIView subclass` in my `UIViewController subclass`.\n\n* If I need to customize a subview, I use Closure Initialization to set the properties I need.\n\n* All constraints code goes into a private function named `layout` - called in `viewDidLoad`. In there, I add subviews and set up constraints.\n\nNow, this seems to work quite well so far. I believe I have a decent code structure that's not too hard to read. That said, I was wondering how other people handle layout in code? Feel free to share.",

            "selftext": "PRE-EDIT: Just want to say thank you to everyone who participated (and who will still participate) in the discussion. Regardless of the final dispensation of my issue (I think I have a plan) I always learn a ton when I post a question and inevitably improve my codebase and my skills. THANKS!\n\nTo start off, I suspect I know why this is happening but have exhausted my ideas for how to solve it.\n\nThe issue is best [illustrated](https://i.imgur.com/elqnR7R.gifv).\n\nIn a nutshell, each cell has a button that increments the data (it's a number of instances of the particular activity). I have a custom animation rolling the old number out and the new number in, but this problem is happening even with standard UIView animations and transitions. Essentially the animation is pulling data from the prior instance of the animation happening (from any cell) and using THAT as the \"outgoing\" label transition, then bringing in the new number. If this is confusing please watch the GIF at the link above, it's easier seen than explained.\n\nUsing no animation at all works fine, the text label just changes.\n\nI kind of suspect this has to do with reusing cells, but not sure how to solve that in this case (or even if that's really the problem). I've tried re-setting the label text to its current, pre-transition state both in prepareForReuse and also just before cellForRow returns the configured cell, but that doesn't solve the problem. \n\nI can put up some code if you want, just let me know what you'd like to see. I was just curious if anyone had any bright ideas after looking at the GIF.\n\nEDIT: Here's some code, hopefully relevant. If it looks weird give me a minute, I'll be editing back and forth to get it right or I might give up a post a gist.\n\nSo in the UITableViewCell you tap the increment button:\n    \n    @IBAction func activityHappened(sender: IncrementButton) {\n        self.activity?.addNewInstance()\n    }\n\nActivity is a managed object, addNewInstance() creates a new instance (also a managed object) and adds it to the set of instances in the Activity object:\n\n    func addNewInstance() {\n        let dm = DataManager()\n        let instance = Instance(context: dm.context)\n        instance.date = Date() as NSDate\n        instance.activity = self\n        self.addToInstance(instance) // this is poorly named, it adds to the Instances set in the Activity managed object\n        do {\n          try dm.context.save()\n        } catch {\n          print(\"failed save in Activity addNewInstance\")\n        }\n      }\n\nThe UILabel that is counting up when you tap the button is a count of all instances that happened today only. This is via a method in Activity that counts all the members in the Instance set that have today's date and returning that count.\n\n    func getTodaysTotal() -> Int {\n        var todayCount = 0\n        if let instances = self.instance {\n          let total: Int = instances.filter({ (inst) -> Bool in\n            let formatter = DateFormatter()\n            formatter.dateFormat = \"EEEE, MMM d, yyyy\"\n            let today = formatter.string(from: Date())\n            return today == (inst as? Instance)?.getFormattedDate()\n          }).count\n          todayCount = total\n        }\n        return todayCount\n      }\n\nSo when the instance is added to the Activity object is when the updating of the cell should get triggered, correct? The below is in the table that shows the activities.\n\n    func controller(_ controller: NSFetchedResultsController<NSFetchRequestResult>, didChange anObject: Any, at indexPath: IndexPath?, for type: NSFetchedResultsChangeType, newIndexPath: IndexPath?) {\n        switch (type) {\n        case .update:\n          tableView.reloadRows(at: [indexPath!], with: .fade)\n        // .. the rest deleted here for brevity\n      }\n\nThen cellForRow is called, which in turn eventually calls a config method on the cell:\n\n    func configureCell(with activity: Activity) {\n        self.activity = activity\n        activityTitleLbl.text = activity.name\n        lastIncidentLbl.text = activity.lastInstance?.getColloquialDateAndTime()\n        animationView.pushTransition(1.0) // animation I found on the street, removing this and using UIView.animation or .transition does not solve the issue\n        todayTotalLbl.text = \"\\(activity.getTodaysTotal())\" // resetting the value on the label. Resetting the value itself works fine, it's just the animation that's wonky\n        self.selectionStyle = .none\n      }\n",

Some other users appear to be having this problem too: https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/70186\n\nI initially developed my app using a free developer account up until now (I am now developing on an account that is enrolled into the Developer Program). I am using Xcode 8.3.3.\n\nIn my \"Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles\" page on the Apple Developer website, upon selecting \"Provisioning Profiles > All\", no provisioning profiles are shown. Instead, a \"Getting started with iOS Provisioning Profiles\" page is displayed.\n\nI have tried to follow the \"Generate Provisioning Profiles with Xcode\" instructions, but they are out of date, so here is what I have done in approximation: I have connected my iPhone and added it to Xcode's Devices menu. In this menu, selecting my iPhone and clicking the cog icon shows that I have three provisioning profiles (eg. one is \"iOS Team Provisioning Profile: *, which expires on 8th Sept 2018. The other two show my app's unique identifier as well as that of its corresponding app extension's). This menu also shows that my app is installed on my iPhone.\n\nI have also clicked \"Automatically manage signing\" in Xcode when targeting my app and having my iPhone as the selected device. It shows the team of my account enrolled in the Apple Developer Program, and it says \"Xcode managed profile\" for the Provisioning Profile. The signing certificate is \"iPhone Developer: bamboo_the_plant*\", followed in brackets by a key of some sort. It installs on my device successfully. Finally, the Apple ID is added as an account in Xcode's Accounts menu.\n\n\\* (Replace this with my real name.)\n\nHow can I get Xcode's automatically-generated provisioning profiles to appear in the Apple Developer web interface?",

While the app was accepted on Google Play in less than 24 hours, the situation on Apple Store has been completely different and we are still waiting to be accepted.\n\nProcess:\n\u2022    First upload (24/8/17): \nAfter the first upload to the Apple Store, we received a comment to clarify some info, which we did right away before uploading again.\n\n\u2022    Second upload (26/8/17): \nWe received a message from the Apple review team that it would be appropriate to remove a feature that incentivizes the user to rate the app, as it was not in compliance with guideline 3.2.2. We also received the notice that \u201cAs a result of violating this guideline, your app\u2019s review has been delayed. Future submissions of this app and other apps associated with your Apple Developer account will also experience a delayed review.\u201c. We promptly wrote back and apologized for this misunderstanding and underlined that it was never our intention to violate any of the guidelines, we were never informed by our developers of these issues before we received the notice about the delay from Apple and that we had missed it ourselves due to the guideline's wording of \"Apps should not require users to rate the app [...] or take other similar actions in order to [...] receive [...] monetary or other compensation\", which we assumed didn't apply since we didn't require the users to rate our app, although we did compensate for doing it by awarding \"points\". When this came to our attention we immediately removed the features to show our good faith and also explained why we had missed it in the first place.\n\n\u2022    Third upload (29/8/17):\nAfter we removed the feature violating Apple\u2019s guidelines, we uploaded a new version. This is currently 10 days ago. We have tried to communicate with Apple through different channels, but the only response we have received is that \u201cAs a result of violating this guideline, your app\u2019s review has been delayed. Future submissions of this app and other apps associated with your Apple Developer account will also experience a delayed review.\u201c although we have been told several times through the phone that our delay has been prioritized. We have no idea of how long the delay is and what the delay actually means for the current situation and the future versions of the app.\n\nWe have been forced to push our launch date of our company multiple times during the past 2 weeks due to this delay and this is very damaging for our start-up. We are therefore honestly panicking and are therefore looking for someone else who has been in a similar situation with Apple.\n\nAt this moment, we feel we have 3 choices:\n\n1)    Do nothing and wait for the delayed review time (which we do not know how long will take!)\n2)    Create an appeal to hopefully convince Apple to remove the delay \n3)    Delete the developer account, and start the uploading process from scratch with a new developer account\n\nIf you have experienced or heard of a similar situation, we would deeply appreciate any information or advice that might help us in this very frustrating situation.",

So hopefully the app will seem familier to iPhone users.\n\n\nHope you\u2019ll like it! It is completely free by the way\n\n\nYou can see some its cool features [here](http://peek.noawitte.dk/index.html), but in short:\n\n* Titles are limited to a maximum size so they do not cover images, but the full title will be revealed if you drag the image down.\n* Cross post subreddits are highlighted in the title and links to that subreddit.\n* If you select text in the title you can in the selection menu search for subreddits with that text.\n* 3D Touch on thumbnails gives a preview of that post. 3D Touch on tables that list subreddits gives a preview of the posts in that subreddit.\n* Subscriptions and multireddits are synced if you log in.\n\n\nThings I\u2019ll add if the app becomes \"popular\": \n\n* Custom comments section (right now it is only a web view)\n* Card scroll view like [Instagram\u2019s](http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple122/v4/1f/0e/38/1f0e38c6-25a6-c76a-b6ec-b03807aa7021/source/392x696bb.jpg)\n* Album support\n* Search posts (not just subreddits)",

I'm close to finishing up a novelty/entertainment app. This will be my first attempt at monetizing an app. I personally hate ads in apps, and am leaning more towards locking some pieces of functionality behind an in-app purchase. What are your feelings on charging, say $4.99 USD one time for full functionality, vs a $.99 or $1.99/monthly subscription fee? Of course this all depends on how much users value an app. But just assuming that someone would pay $4.99 to unlock, is that same user likely willing to instead pay a small monthly fee, in your experience? Or is the monthly structure likely to turn more people away than a higher one-time charge?",

So I assume that in the newer version of XCode, I am to put code in ViewController as opposed to didFinishLaunchingWithOptions. \n\nSo then what's the new purpose of didFinishLaunchingWithOptions in AppDelegate?

Now you're at the liquor store and you're trying to remember if he's into cognac or Japanese whisky. You open my app and check his favorites (cookies, drinks, flowers, ...).\n\nThis is a fairly basic service: you input your own favorites, which are stored in a secured centralized database, and set up sharing permissions to whomever you see fit (family, friends, coworkers, ...). The idea is that when your taste change, you update your favorites and all your acquaintances know your new favorite things.\n\nNow my question is about which backend to use. I checked CloudKit and it seems very appropriate, especially with the sharing feature which fits my needs (setting up different sharing info for different group of persons). However, I would like my service to be available for Android users as natively as possible and I'm afraid (maybe wrongly) that CloudKit JS would be closer to a hack on Android.\n\nWhat do you think would be a good solution? I have other pros and cons for CloudKit and for other services but I'd rather not influence your judgement.\n\nBonus question (not very important at the moment): I know nothing about Android development; would you advise me to learn a bit and do the Android version myself or look for a partner who would handle the Android app?",

One of the problem is everyone has different rates and I have no idea what they would charge on my app idea below.

If you've ever taken a data structures you know exactly what I'm talking about. If not the concept is first in, first out. You get in a line.\nThey get to see their position on the queue as well as everyone else's in the queue. When they're first they get a notification. I get a notification every time someone has moved up as well. Once I work with the person in the front of the line their name disappears from the queue that the customer gets to see, but all the people that I've worked with for the week get put on a small database with their information I collect (phone number or email address and time of the day/week) so I can refer to them later. Like very small database, like 20-25 maximum, or 15 if there are size constraints.\n\nAnd then just have a few pics with my logo and brand related images for background/foreground. nothing fancy, I don't need embedded gifs, but I do need embedded youtube videos they can click on.\n\nSo what do you guys think? Could I learn swift in a few days-weeks to do this? I would be able to dedicate say 1-2 hours every day, but if this becomes a huge time commitment I'd rather have someone else do it, as I have a business to think about.

You'll be able to add a title, photo, and maybe a short description to each pin.\n\nI've played around with Xcode a bit and used the Interface Builder.

They are both almost ready and I would like to get it ready for iOS 11 release.\n\nAny resource added in the app is saved to a database using the API. The app consumes JSON, and because I started coding the app before iOS 11's Codable, I am using Alamofire+SwifyJSON for each request/response handling.  For this matter I am slightly worried about the backend server, specifically that it might not handle a huge number of requests well (This is something I need to work on). The server is currently hosted on a DigitalOcean Droplet, because it was simple enough to set up and I'm still learning AWS, and I am also worried about the incurring costs.  \n\nMy question is what would be the best way to minimise the number of requests sent to the API, but still keep the DB in sync with the app in case the app closes unexpectedly (user termination or app switch/notification). \n\nThank you!",
