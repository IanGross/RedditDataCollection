That being said, it seems to happen a lot with google (google search, or drive), probably because I use those sites most often. For instance, I will go to drive.google.com. The site will load to the splash page, with the \"go to google drive\" button. But when I click the button, it won't load (in chromium or firefox). Or sometimes with google search, it just won't load a search query.\n\n \n\nUsually after about 5~10 minutes, the websites properly load. The sites always load on W7 and android browsers on the same WiFi.\n\n \n\nI'm using university WiFi and, to my knowledge, nothing has changed on my computer or browsers. Can someone tell me what's going on, or if there is a fix?",

There is constantly the account action required notification on my phone. When I click on it it says, \"checking info.\" Then it takes me to a screen that says, \"You were signed out of your Google Account. Sign in again to continue.\" So I hit next and it asks for my password. If I enter the wrong one it says so immediately, if I enter the right one it say, \"Checking info...\" and then it crashes and the cycle starts over.

A few people have suggested that, based on the output of my systemd-analyze blame, my hard drive is growing old, and I ought to look into an SSD to get better boot speeds.\n\nEdit2: I can't yet afford an SSD. However, someone on Askubuntu suggested I follow the instructions [here](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/LTSEnablementStack#Ubuntu_16.04_LTS_-_Xenial_Xerus) and try out LTS Enablement Stacks, and that seems to have halved my boot time.",

            "selftext": "Greetings /r/ubuntu\n\nI am attempting to set up a virtual network for a class I am in. I am failing miserably. This is what I have so far:\n\nI have a host machine running Windows 7. It has VMWare Workstation 12 on it. I have two virtual machines. One virtual machine is running Windows 7 and has one virtual network interface card. The other virtual machine is running Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and has two virtual network interface cards. \n\nThe end goal is to get the virtual Windows 7 to access the internet via the virtual Ubuntu. This way I can run Wireshark on the Ubuntu virtual machine to capture the traffic originating from the virtual Windows 7. \n\nI have set up two networks with VMWare: \n\n* VMnet8, which is a NAT and uses subnet address 192.168.0.0. The host machine has an ip address of 192.168.0.XXX and the gateway is 192.168.0.1. When i run ifconfig on the virtual Ubuntu, this is named ens34.\n\n* VMnet9, which is a Host-Only and uses subnet address 10.0.0.0. When i run ifconfig on the virtual Ubuntu, this is named ens33.\n\nThe virtual Ubuntu has two virtual network interface cards. These virtual network interface cards are used to connect the virtual Ubuntu to VMnet8 and VMnet9. \n\nThe virtual Windows 7 has one virtual network interface card. This virtual network interface card is used to connect the virtual Windows 7 to VMnet9.\n\n**1) First problem:**\n\nOn the Ubuntu machine, when I connect the virtual Ubuntu to VMnet8 using automatic DHCP, the virtual machine connects to the internet just fine. **However**, when I assign an ip address, such as 192.168.0.50, the virtual Ubuntu does not connect to the internet. I have disconnected and reconnected the virtual Ubuntu from the network to ensure the new ip address took hold. \n\n**Question 1:** How can I assign a static ip address for the virtual Ubuntu that will allow it to connect to the internet via VMnet8?\n\n**2) Second problem:**\n\nWhen I am able to connect the virtual Ubuntu to the internet, I am able to ping the Ubuntu from the hosting machine, and vice-versa. Additionally, I am able to ping from the virtual Windows 7 to the virtual Ubuntu, and vice-versa through VMnet9. **However**, I am failing to understand how to set up a bridged connection, or some other type of forwarding, that will send the virtual Windows 7's pings to the host Windows 7 or to the internet. \n\nI have found many guides online that detail how to set up a bridged connection. When I follow them I am not able to accomplish my goal. I feel this may be partly due to a fundamental I lack. \n\n**Question 2:** How would you suggest I forward traffic sent from the virtual Windows 7 through the virtual Ubuntu, so that the virtual Windows 7 can access the internet?\n\nThank you for your time.

            "selftext": "Hi, so my problem is. I am going to do some machine learning at my Uni this semester and we were told to install Ubuntu 16.04.3. I have never worked with Ubuntu or Linux, however I spent quite some time during past week trying to get it work on my 2016 MBP (13 inch, 16GB RAM, 2,9ghz dual core i5, 256GB SSD, Intel Iris Graphics 550). First of all, I installed it using VirtualBox, followed [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qACZ0A8jK-s&feature=youtu.be&t=1024) that our teacher provided us with. I dedicated 8GB of RAM out of 16 to the VM, maximised video memory that it can use and enabled 3D acceleration and the VM was running very laggy and slow. So I did some research and tried dedicating only 4GB of RAM to it to put less pressure on host OS but it was still no better. Then I decided to install it as Dual Boot in order to use full power of my laptop. For this I followed [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQIaDO9nR6Y&t=1s) but I ran into problem when during installation process of Ubuntu I should choose which partition Ubuntu should use. The problem here is that I can't see my main SSD, it only shows me the bootable USB drive that I'm running the installation from. I tried various ways of creating bootable USB (through terminal and also through the program provided by the guy who made the tutorial) and also tried 2 different USB drives but still the same problem. I'm using regular 'old fashioned' USB 3.0 drives connected via USB-C hub. Could this cause some problems and should I rather go and buy USB-C drive that I can connect directly to the laptop or is it pointless? Or does anybody have idea what could cause this issue? I know that these laptops and not very friendly with Linux and I was told that I could use PyCharm and Python 3.5 in OSX in the beginning but I will most probably be required to use Ubuntu later into semester. \nThanks\n\nEDIT: Added laptop specs.",

            "selftext": "I am a college student taking my second precalc class online (because my first precalc teacher on campus did not accommodate my learning style and I struggled a lot) and this class requires mymathlab, which I have set up and I can see everything fine, but I will be doing everything on mymathlab, even tests, so I am taking the \"browser check\" (which refers to programs as well) more seriously. I can't find much information on what linux/ubuntu (version 16.04.2 LTS) programs are compatible with mymathlab or if I will run into any problems. \n\nI figured reddit has always come to my rescue when I was too dumb to figure something out, this particular subreddit is very populous apparently, and mymathlab seems extremely common so I really hope some of you have experience with these issues! Keep in mind, I am not linux/ubuntu obsessed or familiar with any kind of computer language, I do understand how to use terminal when there's specific quotes of what I need to do and I know a little about what things mean. I honestly just hate windows and apple shit, ubuntu is what was laying around and the layout of everything is way easier for me, less annoying updates that change everything and smaller likelihood of malware issues, which is important to me, being a student who relies on their computer but doesn't know how to fix everything (I hope that doesn't offend any of you lol, too busy filling my brain with chemistry and biology to have room for anything resembling computer science). \n\nI do have windows installed on my computer as well if this is impossible, but I really hate it and mostly only use it for DAWs, so i'd have to set everything up and it'd be a pain in my ass. I can also use the computers on campus, but I would like to be able to rely on my PC as well, only being on campus four days a week.",

We will be running Ubuntu with VSFTP. We want this to be setup so that if I were to FTP something to say FTP1 that it would show up on either server. \n\nFor example if I load File A on FTP1 (cause that is where NetScaler sent me) I should be able to see File A on FTP2 as well. \n\nI have some small time experience with some Ubuntu at home but never dealt with it in an enterprise environment and never really dealt with FTP in this way...so any and all advice is welcome.

            "selftext": "Many years ago I had the honor of getting one of my photos featured as one of the included wallpapers in Ubuntu. Having a handful of nice photos to choose from when you first boot up a fresh Ubuntu box is nice, but the rest of the system is so\u2026 empty. Why should it stop with pictures?\n\nI'm _not_ saying \"fill it up with tens of MBs of data!\" I appreciate the effort that goes in to keeping the download as small as possible. I don't always have a fast internet connection or a huge USB stick available.\n\nBut some years ago I listened to the BBC podcast \"Sixty Second Idea to Improve the World\" and heard an idea I haven't been able to shake:\n\nWhy not include the ten most important books in the history of the world with every PC, smartphone, etc?\n\nThis could go a long way to educate a lot of people, and give you something to do on your new system if you're so unlucky that your Broadcom card doesn't work ;) (or if you don't have an internet connection right away for some other reason). And it could be a good way to let so many more people get to know the awesome Gutenberg project.\n\nIt wouldn't have to be the \"most important\" books, of course. It could be like the \"greatest classics\" or something like that. Which ones would have to be decided in some way, but that can come later. The important thing right now is to talk about what you think about the idea.\n\nMoby Dick is quite a hefty book, when you look at the number of pages. Still the epub version weighs in at a measly 550 kB over on Gutenberg projects. So, presuming that most books are smaller than this 10 books would probably add less than 5 MB to the Ubuntu .iso. Wouldn't that be worth it?",

            "selftext": "I love Ubuntu. I love its open source community and its open thinking. And I love its UI. But everything in this world has its cons and so has Ubuntu for me. If someone can make me overcome three biggest fears of Ubuntu, I will be very thankful. So those are:\n\n1. First of all why the heck there is no simple way to install something on Ubuntu. Some apps are in .tar.xz format, some are in .tar.bz, some are in .tar.bz2, some apps need to be installed from software center, some needs to be installed from the terminal and some needs to be compiled in the terminal which is a very complicated process. Why there can't be one or at most two single and easy way to install apps? Never used Windows 10 but on previous versions, Windows needs just to double click .exe file and problem solved. Yes I know there are snaps but they are so less advertised (because not matured yet?) and aren't getting enough attention to become next .exe. Plus AFAIK they occupy much more hard disk space than regular installing methods. It would be very helpful for me if I learn how to properly install and uninstall something in Ubuntu.\n\n2. Why Ubuntu just can't stop spinning my external hard disk when I press \"Eject\" (or similar function) to unmount it? My external disk unmounts for once and then remount itself again after a second. There is an app called \"Disks\" in my Ubuntu 16.04. I open it, click the desired disk and then click \"Power off\" and this is the only way to eject my external disk properly just like Windows do when we click \"eject\" on the disk icon itself. Also, it doesn't stop spinning even when I put my system to sleep mode. The disk just keeps on spinning. Arrrrghhh....\n\n3. What is a proper place to ask all my minor annoyances with Ubuntu where I will be heard and replied by the official developing community? Like whey x or y thing isn't working or why a or b thing is behaving like this. Why my wallpaper stays to default and doesn't change to what I set it to etc.? I know r/Ubuntu is here but r/Ubuntu people aren't directly involved in developing this system.\n\n\nThanks for reading all this. I hope I can keep using Ubuntu for a long long time and never look towards Windows.\n\n\n**Edit: Thanks for all the replies guys. I mark this post as \"Solved\". Much appreciated!**",

I know it won't be the same thing as in Windows but still, I once saw a Linux distro (can't remember it though) which had such thing implemented. As far as I can remember, C: drive contained all the usual folders like bin, boot, dev, etc, lib.... and D: was practically clean and was meant for you to just put all the third-party stuff there.\nIs there any addon/program I could install on my Ubuntu to achieve such result?",

(Not just subjectively, when using the built in firefox, with 2 or 3 tabs open and then opening a new page easily drives the user+sys CPU usage to more than 60%)\n\nWhat the setup is like/what I've done \n * host is Win8.1 and VMM is vmware player\n\n* specifically chosen lubuntu for lightweight\n\n* 8GB vRAM\n\n* 3 vCPUs (physical CPU has 4 cores and I didn't want the VM to be able to eat up all of that) \n\n* live CD iso is in ramdrive (although it seems that there's rarely any access to this drive after booting into DE)\n\n* making sure it doesn't use swap (although swap is also in /dev/zram)\n\nbtw. Also curious is there a huge perf. delta between live CD and an actual install?  And is there any built in methods to make the installed version 'live CD like' (VMM doesn't have a convenient snapshot option).\n\n \nThanks! (and sorry I tried to format but wasn't able to get the bullet point * work)\n\nEdited to fix bullet points and update on another measure to improve preformance.\n\nUpdate: Found a toram boot option which forces the contents of the CD to be copied to ram upon boot. While therotically it should have similar performance as having the iso inside a ramdisk on the physical host, in practice it seems to help a bit, maybe due to reduced latancy of not having to go through all the layers?",

Then, I have installed my Windows 10 as UEFI/GPT on my Black WD.\n\n\nSo far, everything is working fine. However, I would like to know what would be the best course of action for me from there... Should I install Linux on my Black WD along with Windows 10 and use my Blue WD for data? Or would it be overall better to install Ubuntu on my Blue WD (also, is there a clean way to do this so that I can actually access grub every time I reboot instead of randomly...).\n\n> PS.: On a side note, I've read many different things about the checkbox at the beginning of Ubuntu install (the update and third-party software... In your opinions, is it better to check these or not for a new user?)\n\n\nThanks!",

I've previously had a go at FreeNAS, but as i'm new to linux and servers in general, the lack of support and help around it has put me off a little, and got me thinking if it was really for me. I was looking into maybe going Ubuntu, wondering whether to go server or desktop and thought I'd get some advice from the people who know their stuff.\n\nI'm better with a UI than without, but don't mind doing this from another machine (I also have a desktop and laptop), like I have done with FreeNAS. Ideally, with the hardware above, I'm looking for a lightweight OS that can support Plex Media Server, some kind of cloud storage/file storage with viewing capability (suggestions/guides welcome) and maybe other similar sharing programs.

            "selftext": "I recently set up a dualboot with Ubuntu 17.04 and Windows 10 (Home 64). My system came with 8GB of RAM and 512GB of SSD. Here's the partition breakdown:\n\n- **Ubuntu partition:** 25GB, the OS takes up about 5GB and I allocated 10GB of swap space\n- **Windows (C:) partition:** 450 GB, the OS takes up about 30GB\n\nThus, remaining space on the Ubuntu partition is roughly 10GB out of 25GB. I'm trying to understand the file system here. So everything on the **/home directory** (including swap space) is on the 25GB partition? How do I access the rest of the SSD on the primary (C:) drive (~420GB, not including Windows OS) for bulk storage & working directories? Do I need to create a separate partition for this? \n\nOr is the **/home directory** just stored on the 25GB partition? And the /root directory (above /home) is on the rest of the SSD? Upon launching the Terminal, the default directory is /home/[username]. Where would you recommend having working directories to make use of the remaining 420GB of SSD space for projects and assignments? Would this also be the best place to store SDKs and other developer packages?\n\nIf this isn't the right approach, is there a way to re-adjust the partition sizes? Like re-allocating space from the Windows (C:) drive and adding it to /home.",

This leads me to believe that the unallocated portion should be 4K aligned, too, but this does not appear to be the case.\n\nHow do I force the installer to align the partitions it creates or  install Ubuntu on a misaligned root partition?\n\nIf alignment is so important in Unix, why doesn't the installer do this automatically?",

Over the past week, my battery indicator displays somewhere 50-65%, and then suddenly dips to 6%.\n\nA day or so before the issue began, I had installed the xfce desktop, before subsequently uninstalling it, the session and all the other things I needed with it, in two days. Around the same time, I had also set up TLP battery saver to run on startup, a setting I still keep.\n\nCould my battery thing have something to do with what I've done on my system? Should I have the hardware checked? I'd appreciate some insight before I go see IT Help at work, please!\n\nEdit: I have found 1 or 2 people bring up a similar issue recently on Ask Ubuntu (https://askubuntu.com/questions/947506/battery-suddenly-drops-from-66-to-46-22-to-6-percent-fix), but there isn't any response as yet.",

I have an exam tommorrow and encountered a huge problem, I just subbed to this subreddit and I do not know whether's it's appropriate to post this here but I apologize in advance for not having the time to figure out where to go with this.\n\n\nAfter trying to get remote SSH to work by dicking around with some settings, my installed ubuntu 16.04.3 lts is 'gone'. I do not have a 16.04.3 lts disk image, I've got a 16.04.1 iso. So, that gets mounted and prompts for installation. HOWEVER during that installation it notices that 16.04.3 is still present somewhere.\n\nANYONE please, how do I get my 16.04.3 back? \nThanks in advance!!\n\nEDIT: I tried using a 16.04.3 iso. No difference. I made sure 3D acceleration is unchecked in VM (it never was). I checked PAEVM=true as well (and tried any comination of the above being on and off). Still nothing. VM is the latest version as well, and the problem arose either because I was dicking around to get SSH to work OR because I updated/upgraded the ubuntu. *confused internal screaming*\n\n\nEDIT2: I installed the same version (16.04.3 lts) alongside the correct one on the same virtual harddisk. During boot when I chose to boot the correct one instead of the fresh one, it'll still be dead. HOWEVER: MINOR BREAKTHROUGH: When selecting Advanced Options for the correct one during boot, I can boot it in recovery mode.\n\nFIRST I have to select REPAIR BROKEN PACKAGES. It tries to, but it lists a shitton of errors mentioning 'failing to fetch main files'(it goes by lightning fast though). After doing this, it says ABORT, RESTORING ORIGINAL STATE. Now when I select NORMAL BOOT in the RECOVERY menu, it boots 'normally'. The first 'working' boot it gave some errors (appeared and disappeared way to fast for me to read) and didn't have internet connection. After resetting the machine and reproducing the above procedure, it works normally (still need to look into whether everything's functional though). The problem persists though: I have to perform the failing package reparation through recovery mode EVERYTIME in order to get in.\n\nTL;DR: Have to boot through RECOVERY in order to fail performing package reparations EVERYTIME in order to boot the correct 16.04.3 lts. Problem persists thusfar. Any help/tips/ideas appreciated.",

Don't want to clutter the mailing list with this.\n\nSo I tried to install Ubuntu Studio 17.04 on my laptop (Intel\u00ae Pentium\u00ae processor N3700)\n\n* In the Install process you get the option *\"Wireless: Connecting this computer to a wi-fi network allows you to install third-party software, download updates, automatically detect your timezone, and install full support for your language.\"*\n\nI clicked *\"Connect to this network\"*,  but the only 'network' listed was *\"Realtek Semiconductor Corp.\"* \n\nI had no option but press Next without having connected to Wi-Fi. \n\n* I picked install third party software (even though it was not really explained why this is unchecked by default, what kind of creator would want an installation which does not support MP3 for example?), expecting this to be fixed by the time I would boot into the new installation.\n\n* *\"Where are you\"* - shows a map. Typing in the name of my city or big cities near mine, or even New York, didn't work. Clicking it allowed me to pick where I am. So you have to click quite precisely. Typing it out isn't an option.\n\n* Next, the keyboard layout. I have a keyboard with the \u20ac sign on CTRL ALT 5. So I picked \"English (US) - English ((US, with euro on 5)\". To my suprise, in the text field, pressing CTRL ALT 5 doesn't input the Euro sign.\n\n* Also confusing: in addition to full disk encryption, the installer also offers home directory encryption. I had to look this up as no explanation is given. Because it kills performance and battery life I chose to not enable it.\n\nOkay, so the system booted just fine.\n\nUnfortunately, it seems my (very common) integrated Wi-Fi adapter is not supported out of the box. Maybe it required internet access to download third party drivers? That would be ironic, since without Wi-Fi there is no internet on this laptop.\n\nI ran lsusb and it says:  \n>Bus 001 Device 004: ID 0bda:b720 Realtek Semiconductor Corp.\n\nUnfortunately, this laptop does not have an ethernet port, and without internet this installation is of no use to me. Since the steps required to get the Realtek to work are neither straightforward nor available on the official Ubuntu Studio website, I have given up, for now.\n\nI'll wait until it truly is the year of the Linux laptop.\n\nEDIT: formatting.",

This requires no NATing and just routing the traffic. I have a feeling this is simple with linux but how could I setup ubuntu to take traffic as a gateway (10.0.0.10) and route it to another IP address (10.0.0.1). This would allow us to keep the iptables. Somewhat like a layer 3 software tap.\n\nIf I were able to do a failover gateway as well, that would be helpful as well since we will have multiple choices for FW testing and not having to reconfigure would be helpful.\n\nAny advice is appreciated, thanks",
