What I'm trying to sort out is the complexity of accepting money via multiple inputs CC, Paypal, Google, and then the ability to pay out in some way.  (via PayPal, Google, CC etc)\n\nObviously I'm not glossing over the \"difficulty\" of this, or legality as I'm already in contact with a law firm who can help me sort out the legals.  I'm just trying to sort out my options  for outsourcing the billing portion, as I just don't know.\n\nEDIT:  /u/so_just pointed to stripe, and they have this in the documentation https://stripe.com/blog/send-money-to-debit-cards they have a process to send money out, so I think I'll start there.\n\n",

            "selftext": "Hello Reddit,\nI wanted to share my first own website [miguelsantoscorrea.com](https://miguelsantoscorrea.com) with you. It has an interactive fluid simulation with a rubber ducky on the landing page. Open the page and click on the background to see what happens. The website is responsive, so it will work on mobile and desktop.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI got inspired by a [Jekyll Theme](https://nrandecker.github.io/particle/) and decided to add my own style to it. The fluid simulation was done with [Liquidfun](http://google.github.io/liquidfun/) and [Threejs](https://threejs.org/). Liquidfun was easy to pick up thanks to the many examples on the Liquidfun Github page. I can recommend it to anyone to try it out. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe biggest challenge I faced while building the website was trying to render the duck. The Liquidfun engine uses an inverted y-axis compared to Threejs, so drawing the duck at the correct position became trickier than I initially imagined (due to rotation). I solved the problem by manually computing the correct positions of all the duck parts on every frame. A better solution would have been to write a function that renders and arbitrary shape at the correct position. Unfortunately I didn't manage to do that since i'm still unexperienced with Threejs. If you are interested in trying to code a similar website you can find the relevant code by opening my website with developer tools and look at the liquid.js file.\n\nThe next challenge was to optimize the code, so that you get a decent performance on most devices. I experienced the biggest hit in performance after implementing the physical body of the duck. It currently consists of 3 circles (one for head, two for body) and I would advise against using more complex shapes as the simulation then becomes slow. Also should you not make a simulation with more than 1 thousand water particles.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI hope you enjoy my website, i still have alot to learn about web development.\nI am looking forward to hear from your opinions on my website. Any criticism is welcome.",

Here's a [screenshot of the dashboard](https://imgur.com/3jJr9vG) and here is a [screenshot of the editor](https://imgur.com/a/WtkyD). \n\nI got the idea for the project from problems I encountered in my side-projects and at work. \n\nSometimes I want to run a recurring script with a cron job, but the process ends up taking a decent amount of time between deploying, scheduling, and setting up monitoring for the script. I also have scripts that I run manually. For example, a script that deletes bad rows from my database. However, SSH-ing into a production machine and running those scripts from the console feels slightly unsafe. \n\nSo currently the solution is focused around letting me create Node scripts that I can run manually or schedule, without having to worry about hosting or deploying to a server.

If you're interested sign up [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/groupdeals/comments/6nprta/wes_bos_courses_megathread/?)**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSome time ago, when Wes Bos released the Node.js course, there were a lot of people around here that wanted the course and so people got organized and created groups of 10 to get it at a discount. I lead one of those groups at the time, and while it was a handful of work, I think it paid out end the end.\n\nToday I received an email from Wes about him updating his ES6 course, now including newer stuff from ES7 and whatnot. This is a course that I've been meaning to get for a while, so I was wondering if anyone else would like to group up for it. The 10-spots package is $280, meaning the course is just $28 per person. \n\n&nbsp; \n\nIf you're insterested just reply here or send me a DM and I'll arrange the group!",

The issue I am running into is that on iOS safari/chrome that the fixed nav bar is not showing up. It works fine on Chrome on my Desktop and Chrome on my Android. \n\nThe menu toggle even shows up(albeit not in the right spot) if I shrink my window on Safari on my Mac. \n\nHere is the CSS of specifically of that bar. If I remove the position fixed from site navigation(where I added it for mobile) the hamburger icon appears. Is there some weird issue with fixed positioning and recent iOS updates? \n\nWe are using bootstrap 4 as well. I personally have never seen this issue before.\n\n    #site-navigation {\n      display: flex;\n      align-items: center;\n      #primary-menu {\n        margin: 0;\n        padding: 0;\n        > li { \n          text-transform: lowercase; \n          font-weight: 600;\n        }\n    \n        li {\n          list-style: none;\n          &:hover { \n            background-color: nth($colors, 25);\n            \n            a {\n              text-decoration: none;\n              color: #fff; \n            }\n          }\n          &.menu-item-has-children {\n            position: relative;\n            \n            .sub-menu {\n              display: none;\n              position: absolute;\n              top: 100%;\n              left: auto;\n              right: -179px;\n              width: 800px;\n              margin: 0 auto;\n              padding: 10px;\n              background-color: nth($colors, 25);\n              z-index: 101;\n    \n              > li { \n                text-transform: initial; \n                font-weight: 500;\n                \n                ul {\n                  li { margin-bottom: 30px; }\n                }\n              }\n              \n              @media (max-width:768px) {\n                left: auto;\n                right: auto;\n                width: 100%;\n              }\n            }\n            &:hover {\n              .sub-menu {\n                display: flex;\n              }\n            }    \n          }    \n        }\n    \n        @media(max-width: 480px) {\n          margin-left: -15px;\n          margin-right: -15px;\n          text-align: center;\n          background-color: #fff;\n          margin-top: 158px;\n        }\n      }\n    }\n    \n    @media(max-width: 480px) {\n      #site-navigation {\n        position: fixed;\n        height: 62px;\n        max-width: 100%;\n        flex-shrink: 0;\n        flex-basis: auto;\n        flex: 0 1 100%;\n        @include transition();\n        .menu-toggle, .menu-main-menu-container, .sub-menu { position: absolute; }\n        \n          .menu-toggle { \n            right: 30px;\n            top: 20px;\n          }\n          .menu-main-menu-container { \n            width: 100vw;\n            #primary-menu {\n              li { padding-left: none; }\n            }\n          }\n      }\n    }\n    \n    .shadow {\n      box-shadow: 0 2px 3px 0px rgba(0,0,0,0.8);\n      background-color: nth($colors, 25);\n    }",

I've also been wanted to play around with Laravel which ServerPilot also supports, basically anything PHP. \n\nIf I installed ServerPilot on a fresh Ubuntu VPS, am I limited to only using PHP based apps on the server? As in, can I ssh into the server directly and host static content or maybe a Node, Python, or some other type of app? Does ServerPilot configure nginx, mysql, and PHP the way you would from scratch so I can access it outside of their control panel if need?\n\nI basically don't want to restrict myself.

I am coming at this from a Node.js point of view, but I think it applies generally.\n\nI have an API, which has a number of endpoints that I want to test. Fairly standard stuff.\n\nI can create unit tests for a number of methods and functions easy enough, however I am struggling a bit with how best to test when a particular endpoint/method/function is required to interact with the database.\n\nDo I actually use the database? Potentially seed with some data that I need and verify that I insert/update/delete/retrieve the data correctly? This seems like the most foolproof way, but then you end up with situations where the tests fail and you are left with a contaminated database - and then the next load of tests fail and so on.\n\nDo I mock the response from the database? Seems easier, but is it actually testing properly if my test is just assuming that the database portion is working fine.\n\nMaybe my understanding of mocking is a bit off?\n\nAny advice?! ",

            "selftext": "**TL;DR Version**: I would like to read a practical book where writers would show with examples and walk through a reader, step-by-step, on how to design and build web applications using HTML/CSS/JavaScript and what programs to use to do so, but without explaining basics of the language itself, like what a variable is and how to use functions.\n\n**  \t**\n\n**  \t**\n\nSo during summer I've read [Head First HTML and CSS](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596159924.do), [Head First JavaScript Programming](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920027065.do) and [Head First HTML5 Programming](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920010906.do). I've even written few little apps and my first extensions for Chrome and Firefox for personal use. Now I read [Head First jQuery](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920012740.do) and [Learning JavaScript Design Patterns](https://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/).\n\nAnd I still feel like this little guy:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/ZTxqXYg.png\n\nAnalogy is: I know how to write few letters and maybe even one or two words. But the fact that someone knows few words doesn't make this person a novel writer. In terms of learning language itself I know what books I have to read next - it's [You Don't Know JS \\(book series\\)](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/README.md). But that's not what I'm after at the moment.\n\n**  \t**\n\n**  \t**\n\nWhat I want is to not just learn/know HTML/CSS/JavaScript but to actually know and actually develop websites and web applications properly. The closest things I found so far:\n\n1. Article: [Creating a Web App from Scratch](https://css-tricks.com/app-from-scratch-1-design/).\n1. [JavaScript Web Applications\\(2011\\)](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920018421.do).\n1. [Head First Software Development\\(2008\\)](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596527358.do).\n\nKnowing language syntax, how it works and some basic design patterns doesn't make me a functioning web developer, right? Knowing syntax, patterns and tricks is like knowing how to put bricks on one another, but knowing it doesn't make me an architect. And I would like to learn how to design, architect and then develop more complex applications from scratch.\n\nWhen I was reading Head First series, they recommended using just usual text editor and I didn't like it from the start: you had to type everything manually, it was very error prone, etc. At some point of time I made my research and found WebStorm. It made things so much more comfortable, faster, easier, efficient, etc. That's a nice tool in a web developer's belt but I'm sure it's just one of thousands of them there. I think effective tools in a belt and knowing how to use these tools are as important as knowing language itself, design patterns, APIs and whatever else.\n\nMy point is, I don't want to just learn/know theory: language, design patterns, APIs and whatever else, I want to be able to develop and to actually develop efficient web sites and web applications using efficient tools(and know how to use these tools with maximum efficiency too). The books I've read don't teach how to develop web applications from scratch and they don't teach how to use tools, like, IDE, for example. They teach basic things, like what functions or objects are.\nI don't want to read any more what variables, functions, objects, closures or design patterns are.\n\nSo, let's say I want to develop a web application from scratch to track of what I've done, to schedule events for the future, to make notes, and it has to have:\n\n* Homepage\n* Logged out page\n* Logged in page\n* Log in page\n* Settings page\n* Lost password page\n* Account activation page\n\nNow I would like to read a practical book where they would explain on how to design and build web applications from scratch(including a part of making sketches on paper/painting app) using HTML/CSS/JavaScript and what programs to use to do so but without explaining basic stuff, like what a variable is and how to use functions.\n\nAre books mentioned above: [JavaScript Web Applications\\(2011\\)](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920018421.do) and [Head First Software Development\\(2008\\)](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596527358.do) are the kind of books I want to read? Or should I read something else? Can you recommend more books about process of web development?\n\nI hope you guys can recommend some literature. Thanks in advance!",

It appears that every uses can generate an API key and use it in third party application for it to retrieve their information. However, every user that logs into our app has to provide the API key.\n\nThere is, of course, many approach to doing this. The current one, suggested by one of our team member who figured out how to use the API, is using an automated script that goes to the employee management app to get the API key to our app.\n\nThe process would be, employee logs into our app and an automated script would navigate to the employee management app, use their credentials to log in, generate the API, and then return it to our app. My concern is, security wise, is this safe?

Go me. \ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89\n\nBut it turns out that I don't actually blog at all and I'm not swapping in and out themes or plugins pretty much ever.  I basically just log in every so often to tweak some words and bulk-update things.\n\nSo I don't really need the overhead of wordpress: I could easily get by with some super cheap web hosting (like S3 or NearlyFreeSpeech, even github pages) -- it wouldn't exactly be trivial, but I reckon I could do it over a couple of weeks.\n\nMy bigger question is around my email. My cheap shared hosting is also gives me an email server (that I just forward to my hotmail, but anyway). If I quit the shared hosting, I'll lose the custom email domain, at least the way it's set up now.\n\nIf I own a domain, it looks like I get it configured to sent email through to hotmail/gmail without buying hosting, although hotmail (outlook) appear to charge for it.\n\nWhat do other people do who are relying on super cheap / free hosting?",

I was here about 3 months ago to talk about the latest project I had worked on, a meme postcard web app. It took the UI of a meme generator and used it to create and send postcards with memes as backgrounds. It was a bit ridiculous but you guys seemed to like it.\n\nShortly after we launched we noticed a really weird trend: the bulk of our orders were being sent to prisons, and they were all using custom photos not memes. We mailed them out the same as all the others but didn't really know what to make of that. After some googling, we found out that a lot of prisons have postcard-only policies and others don't allow packages of any sort, including envelopes with photos. Other custom postcard sites either only let you order bulk amounts of one design and they don't mail them, or they do let you order single cards but have incredibly convoluted interfaces and require an account, etc. Not good for a quick one-off order.\n\nWe had inadvertently created a useful tool for people to mail photos to loved ones in prison as easily as they would share them on social media. As soon as we realized we decided to refocus our efforts because it seemed much more useful than meme postcards. It's actually hard to get less useful than meme postcards.\n\nThere were a few special instructions for mailing to prison, specifically that the inmate number needed to be included after the name, so we made a new version of the site, revamped the design, and streamlined it to focus on sending custom photo postcards to inmates. Just last week we launched [Postcardstr.com](https://postcardstr.com/) and we're working to get the word out there about the project.\n\nAnyways I thought I'd share since I got awesome criticism from here when I showed you the meme card site and used it to improve the overall look and usability of the new version. Thanks everyone!\n\n**Edit:** Just in case the link is hard to spot and you want to check it out: https://postcardstr.com/",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone. So currently I'm an apprentice web developer working within an agency with a fairly small team. I have about half a year remaining. As a result of the 'small-ish' team, I've been given a lot of work of various sizes, nothing huge though! I've done work for some of our largest clients and haven't ever not been able to do something. I know a fair amount about dev ops, good practices with Git etc, I'm very confident in HTML, CSS, I know JavaScript fairly well. I use SASS all the time with gulp. I've begun working my way through some Vue.js, although I can't write it from scratch, I'm able to pick up other peoples work. I have quite a good understanding of PHP and I'm currently learning Laravel.\n\nThe reason I explain that is I feel I'm overqualified to be an apprentice, I've been told this by people as well. From what I can tell a lot of apprentices require teaching by colleagues and don't have much knowledge within the area. I feel I have quite a good overall knowledge and I don't often ask colleagues for help as I'm able to do it myself. (Obviously, I do ask when I deem necessary). \n\nSo here's my issue. When my apprenticeship ends I think I'll be offered a junior position. Realistically I'm a junior at the moment and I feel I should maybe negotiate my position I'm offered. The issue is (although I have here), in front of people I can't talk about my self and big myself up. I just hate blowing smoke up my own ass and isn't like me to do so. So how do I come about possibly negotiating a better position coming to the end of my apprenticeship? I thoroughly enjoy working with the people I do, I feel the company is great and I'm well suited within and I don't want to hinder that. \n\nAny advice is much appreciated. If based on reading that you feel I should still be a junior, please let me know. Hard to tell exactly as I don't have loads of experience to tell. ",

            "selftext": "**Edit:** Thanks for everyone's input.  At this time we've decided to just make the site ourselves using WordPress.  Even if everything they are saying to me is genuine, it's become clear that they're ultimately unnecessary.\n\nTL;DR: Site creation company is claiming that if we don't have SSL, SEO, a unique site structure, and a mobile-friendly interface that our site will not show up in Google's search results.  Wondering if it's even worth going with them if I could recreate the site using GoDaddy's Wordpress hosting feature.\n\nLong version:\n\nHello - I'm not sure if this is the best place to ask this question, so if it isn't, please let me know where is.\n\nI work for a supply company, and we recently struck a deal to begin selling products from a Chinese company here in the US.  Part of that involves setting up a US-based website for their company.\n\nWe first asked the same company that made and maintains our own site (which was made before I joined), but as they were putting together a quote, I looked at the site we were trying to re-create and realized that it was simple enough that I could do it myself.  So I began doing it, and it was actually turning out pretty well.\n\nHowever, then the company set up a meeting with us and gave their pitch.  Most of it felt like fluff, but their main selling point was on search engine optimization.  They told us that Google has very specific guidelines, and if your site does not follow those guidelines, they will essentially omit your site from search results.  When I asked them to elaborate on this, and exactly what those guidelines were, they were unable to give a clear answer, instead saying things like, \"It varies over time,\" and, \"They don't tell you specifically.\"  They claimed the official guide was hundreds of pages long, then searched for a .pdf that turned out to be maybe 40 pages long.  Then they tried saying that there's much more than what would be in that guide.  It felt very suspicious.\n\nThe first thing they warned us about was Google seeing my recreated site as duplicate content.  Basically, their pitch was that since the way they would create the site was structured differently than what I would do, then Google would not see it as a duplicate site (duplicating the original Chinese site), and thus there would be a better chance of it showing up in search results.  To prove this, they tried searching for the original site, only to find that it didn't show up at all, probably because the site is based in China and thus has a .cn domain.  Ours would be based in the US with a .com domain.  Not to mention, my site would most likely not be structured the same as the original site, and it certainly is not coded the same.\n\nThe second thing they warned us was about having the site be mobile-friendly.  They pointed us to another one of their sites and demonstrated how, when the window is resized to a vertical format as would appear on a phone or tablet, the top menu shrinks down into a one-button mobile-friendly menu.  While of course I get that being mobile-friendly is a better customer experience, I'm skeptical of their claim that not having a mobile-friendly site would omit you from Google.  Who would be checking that to begin with?\n\nThe final thing was SSL certification, basically using HTTPS instead of HTTP, or at least that's what they were trying to explain.  To be honest, they were going at a mile a minute and it was kind of hard to keep up with them at times.  But their claim was that if we don't have that, Google will ignore our site.\n\nBut even if all that were true, my other thought is most of that is pretty basic stuff that we wouldn't really need them for.  We already have the domain registered through GoDaddy, and I could sign up for Wordpress hosting, make the site myself still (really it's a very simple site) and get SEO, SSL, whatever other bells and whistles I'm apparently supposed to have.  Most of the other things they were pitching were just fluff.  I don't want to give out the exact price quotes, but needless to say it would cost us a truckload more money for them to build and maintain the site than it would to just do it ourselves with Wordpress.\n\nSo did anything they pitch to me ring true?  And even if it is, is it worth my time if I could do the same thing they're doing with GoDaddy and Wordpress hosting?  I certainly have the time and at least enough know-how to use Wordpress' creation tool.\n\nThanks for the help.",

I have over 25,000 users and 4.7 ratings on both platforms! Tekken has many characters with many attacks. If I told you Feng d/f+3 is a safe attack, you won't know what d/f+3 looks like unless you turn on the game and look it up or just know some how.\n\n\nI am kicking off a project where I am getting animated gifs of EVERY single character attack. I wrote a tool with React/Redux and node to do this. Here is some progress I've made:\n\n\nhttps://gfycat.com/@offinbed/albums\n\n\nI have a team of video makers and the gif making tool is supposed to be used by a bunch of volunteers. I'm going to be recruiting a bunch more soon.\n\n\n\n\nI already have the gif making tool finished, however, there is NO styling and it has a few bugs and inconsistencies.\n\n\nI have some features in mind I'd like to see and I just want a little help. Keep in mind that I have started these projects for learning experience and I would love to get feedback on stuff like more efficient code, better practices and refactoring etc etc.\n\n\n\nIf anyone else is looking to learn some stuff or keep sharp, have something nice to throw on their portfolio and work on something cool, let me know! The repo is right here:\n\n\nhttps://github.com/ndejesus1227/T7-Chicken-giffer\n\n\n\nAlso, after this temporary project, I was thinking of actually redoing this but not JUST for Tekken. Making a really effective tool for creating gifs using gfycat for any and everyone. I'm hoping that whoever helps with this small tool right now would be willing to kick off a bigger related project from scratch with me. I imagine we'd be using a lot of the old code from here.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from those that are interested!\n",

No JS/jquery\n* VCS: **Git + Gitlab** (since they offer provate repositories)\n* Build: Makefiles for simplifying testing (pytest), linting, installation\n* Isolated environment: **virtualenv**\n\nRegarding full text search: I think I can pull that off with SQLAlchemy only: index searchable columns, and whenever users send GET request to     /search I will execute something like this:\n\n    db.session.query(Comment).filter_by(Comment.text.ilike('%blabla%'))\n\nApart for Flask-SQLAlchemy, which I won't use, which Flask extensions do I need (to prevent SQL injection for instance)?\n\n\n[0]  [SQLAlchemy in Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/patterns/sqlalchemy/#declarative)",

We are working with .NET WebForms/Knockoutjs & MySQL (and ofcourse bootstrap). So lately there isn't much tasks to do and i decided to learn new framework/library/technology in my free time. My thoughts are to completely change the tech stack and try mongodb/nodejs/angular(or react) and try materialize instead of bootstrap. Mainly i'm not sure if i should learn Angular or React and Nodejs or .NET MVC/Core.\n\nI like React because the code seems more clear and readable to me than Angular and its using ES6, but about Angular is that its a framework(and not a library like React) and its using TypeScript and my OOP skills are not the best which will help me learn OOP better. I mean i know the fundamentals of OOP but i have no serious practice with it. \n\nWhat should i learn? And where is the best to start with? Tbh i don't like videos, i prefer tutorials/books/article how to build web app from scratch etc. Yeah videos may teach you a lot but it takes too much time to take you to the point.",

Specifically here one example would be where API clients are using user-generated input to try resolve character names & IDs, where the names may comply with pattern rules but not exist.\n\nEqually should 5*xx* errors for specific endpoints lead to a scenario where all API access is stalled (yet just for that client app), either because of a global error-rate-limiter in the API, or by self-policing to avoid said limiter?\n\nTo me this seems it's going to force API users to develop per-endpoint error counting & limiting anyway, to try minimise the potential impact of this API's error-limiter. That work would better be done only once by the API devs, and also avoid a single global synchronised counter bottleneck for both clients and API server.\n\nEdit: Also, how could any client implement error-counting without a single global 1-at-a-time bottleneck for all their API calls?  \nAnd how would a single app ID handle this across large numbers of otherwise-independent instances (e.g. installed on mobile devices) without then requiring a central server to 'phone home' to, as all errors will be grouped under the 1 app ID?",

If the ad broker decides not to serve an ad for this particular pageview, it will offer me back the space by loading an iframe containing https://example.com/altad.php from which my server serves its own ad instead. I would like to be able to access session data of the main page within altad.php, in order to know which other ads are already showing on the page to prevent duplicates. This seems to be working for some browsers, but not others. It could be related to the blocking of third-party cookies, but I'm not sure. Would the fact that the innermost iframe is contained in a iframe served from a different domain (the ad broker's) somehow break things? Is there a simple way around it?\n\nEDIT: after accepting defeat earlier and implementing an alternative approach (see my comment below), I decided to try and come up with a solution along the lines of u/miniversal 's suggestion. I ended up using [cross-document messaging](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/web-messaging.html), inspired by the example in the bottom answer [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19406541/how-to-call-parent-window-javascript-function-inside-iframe).

Also, I apologize for the lengthy post!\n\nI've been self-learning front-end for quite some time and i'm now at a place where I'm comfortable enough to navigate around. I've also received a \"Career Studies Certificate\" from my local community college (They didn't have any kind of Web Development or CS program..) and I'm now teaching myself the MEAN stack.\n\nThe company I work for is an IT Consulting company that encompasses many different fields from development, data services, business to business, to things such as break/fix and support. My personal role is essentially a glorified customer service rep, I get outsourced on a contractual basis to anyone who needs me to assist in migrations from legacy file transfer systems to a new one.\n\nNone of what I do in my day to day job or in my job role is anywhere near the Web Dev space, which is my goal. Oddly enough, none of the developers we have in-house or abroad on contracts have web experience, front-end or otherwise. One of our partners/clients decided to pay for a 3rd party to re-design our website (which was quite dated, sadly I was working on a re-design myself in an attempt to surprise my manager, the companies VP, until I found out about this). The company that did it essentially updated our version of wordpress and threw together something using Divi 3.0's Visual Builder. I don't believe they've done any QA and that site is now live.\n\nThey handed the \"keys\" over to our companies graphic designer who found out I knew front-end and now they have me taking care of bugs and implementing updates/changes to the site. I'm happy to do it as I enjoy it quite a bit more than my actual daily tasks but I'm not getting any kind of compensation for it or any change in role. I'm unsure if after my current project there will be any opportunity for me to move to this kind of role or not.\n\nMy question is, should I bring this up to my manager, my annual review is coming up soon and I don't even think he's aware of this happening? Has anyone else been in this situation, what would or what have you done to remedy this situation and get properly recognized/compensated? \n\nMy annual salary is much less than the average entry front-end dev income for my area...\n\nI'm genuinely at a loss as to what course of action I should take here or if it would even be worth it.

It appears as if they have a free tier and I can just upgrade from there if I need to. If it's actually free I might just develop on it, I don't really see why not (security reasons are probably why not..). \n\nI have set up a small apache server before and that's what I'm guessing the cloud box will use, but I have no idea if that's how you actually host on the cloud (if you could give me some insight that'd be great!).

I have to create editor web app to change textures of those objects. Something like mug or t-shirt editor, basically, but the shape of every object is different.  \nI am only interested in front, back and top model faces. For example, I have to add text to front face and image to back face, rotate those 2D objects, resize them, etc.  \nI see two ways of doing this:\nFirst - I do all that right on 3D model, using 2D objects in 3D space. If so, how can I deal with model faces not being completely straight? Currently, I look into three.js to display my 3D model. is that the right choice?  \nSecond - I change 2D texture of model, then save it and apply to 3D object. I guess I need to somehow take only needed faces from texture file and then insert them back. Is there some clever way to do so? I found out about fabric.js for that purpose, should I use it?  \nI hope you understood what I tried to say. All opinions on what to use for this task and tips about how to implement it the easiest way are very appreciated.  \nThank you.",

If you'd like to read the other six parts, please see the links below:\n\n* [Introduction](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/71mmph/building_a_web_app_from_start_to_finish_part_1/)\n* [Planning a project](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/71mozr/building_a_web_app_from_start_to_finish_part_2/)\n* [Project setup](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/71tmce/building_a_web_app_from_start_to_finish_part_3/)\n* [Writing the first test](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/725srd/building_a_web_ap_from_start_to_finish_part_4/)\n* [Coding the first feature](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/72f72t/building_a_web_app_from_start_to_finish_part_5/)\n* [Create, edit, and delete](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/72n0yg/building_a_web_app_from_start_to_finish_part_6/)\n\nThe app that I'm building for this demonstration is a run of the mill reddit/HN-style Rails application called \"[rankit](https://github.com/bridge-ro/rankit).\" As a disclaimer, this isn't intended to be a Rails tutorial. My aim is to re-acclimate myself to Rails development and hopefully help new web devs who are stuck in the \"where do I start?\" phase.\n\nIn the previous post, I continued using a test-first approach to code the remaining link CRUD actions. There are two things I have left to do before I consider the initial link submission feature finished:\n\n* I need to write validations for the model\n* I need to review my code and refactor if necessary\n\nThis post will focus on the first of those two tasks: validations.\n\n**Determine what to validate**\n\nThe first thing I need to do is determine which model attributes I want to validate. In this case, it's remarkably easy since the `Link` model only has two attributes right now: a description and a url. I know that, at the very least, both should to be present in order for a user to submit them. I would also like for the descriptions to be short and direct, so I should also ensure that a description doesn't surpass a maximum number of characters. Lastly, I need to ensure that a url is an actual url and not just a string of characters.\n\nSo, in bullet point form, here's what I need to validate:\n\n* A link must have a description \u2013 it can't be blank\n* A description can't be more than 180 characters long\n* A link must have a url \u2013 it can't be blank\n* A url must be a properly formatted HTTP/HTTPS url\n\n**Create a validation branch**\n\nValidations may not necessarily be a feature but I still like to develop them in their own git branch:\n\n    git branch validate_links\n    git checkout validate_links\n\n**Write attribute validation specs**\n\nNow that I know what to validate, I need to write tests to ensure that my validations work properly.\n\nThe first two validations are pretty simple since I set the foundation for them in an earlier post. In that post, I wrote the following specs for the `Link` model:\n\n    it \"has a description\" do\n      expect(link.description).not_to be_nil\n    end\n    \n    it \"has a url\" do\n      expect(link.url).not_to be_nil\n    end\n    \nAt the time, I knew that these tests weren't very useful. Adding validations will make them serve an actual purpose.\n\nRails provides the `valid?` method to check whether a database record passes the model's defined validations. If it doesn't pass validation \u2013 that is, if the record isn't valid \u2013 Rails will return error messages that can be accessed by calling `errors` on the record. This means that I can test whether or not a record is valid by calling the `valid?` method and then checking whether any errors were generated:\n\n    it \"has a description\" do\n      link.valid?\n      expect(link.errors[:description].any?).to eq false\n    end\n    \n    it \"has a url\" do\n      link.valid?\n      expect(link.errors[:url].any?).to eq false\n    end\n    \nIf I run my specs now, everything still passes. Since the `Link` model has no validations, no errors are generated when `valid?` is run. However, I don't just want to test whether a link with proper attributes is valid; I also want to test whether a link without any attributes is invalid.\n\nTo do this, I first create an RSpec context wrapper for the existing specs:\n\n    context \"with proper attributes\" do\n      let!(:link) { Link.create(link_attributes) }\n    \n      it \"has a description\" do\n        link.valid?\n        expect(link.errors[:description].any?).to eq false\n      end\n    \n      it \"has a url\" do\n        link.valid?\n        expect(link.errors[:url].any?).to eq false\n      end\n    end\n    \nThen I define another context wrapper to hold my new spec:\n\n    context \"without a description or url\" do\n    end\n    \nFor this context, I need to set up an example link with blank attributes. I use the `link_attributes` method to do this for the sake of consistency, passing it a hash of blank attributes to override the defaults:\n\n    let!(:link) { Link.create(link_attributes(description: \"\", url: \"\")) }\n    \nThen I write a spec similar to the two I wrote above, only this time I expect the `errors.any?` check to be true:\n\n    it \"is invalid\" do\n      link.valid?\n      expect(link.errors[:description].any?).to eq true\n      expect(link.errors[:url].any?).to eq true\n    end\n    \nNow when I run my specs, I get a failure:\n\n    Failures:\n    \n      1) Link without a description or url is invalid\n         Failure/Error: expect(link.errors[:description].any?).to eq true\n     \n           expected: true\n                got: false\n                \nThe test expected there to be errors but didn't get any because there are no validations. That means my next step is to add validations to the model. Before I do that, now is a good time to commit my specs to git:\n\n    git commit -am \"Write link validation specs\"\n    \n**Validate link model attributes**\n\nThis is probably the easiest Rails validation to write (in the `link.rb` file):\n\n    validates :description, :url, presence: true\n    \nIf I run my specs now, everything passes and I can move on to the next validations.\n\n**Write the description length validation spec**\n\nI have two more validations to test: whether a link has a description less than the maximum length (180 characters) and whether it has a proper url. I start by grouping these two specs together in another RSpec context:\n\n    context \"with improper attributes\" do\n    end\n    \nThen I create a test link with a description that's too long and a url that's just a text string. For the description, I went to a character counting site and just copied their helpful length rules for different sites, which happened to be over 180 characters:\n\n    let!(:link) { Link.create(link_attributes(description: \"Snapchat's caption character limit is 80. Twitter's character limit is 140. An SMS text message limit is 160. Pinterest pins can have up to 500 characters. Instagram captions and comments can fetch 2,200 characters.\", url: \"Loose turnip dot government\" )) }\n    \nI want to start by just writing a spec for the description since I already know how to implement the validation. The url validation will take a little more thought, so I'll save it for last. The test itself is pretty much the same as the previous one I wrote:\n\n    it \"is invalid if the description is over 180 characters\" do\n      link.valid?\n      expect(link.errors[:description].any?).to eq true\n    end\n    \nI run my specs to ensure that it's failing:\n\n    Failures:\n    \n      1) Link with improper attributes is invalid if the description is over 180 characters\n         Failure/Error: expect(link.errors[:description].any?).to eq true\n     \n           expected: true\n                got: false\n                \nAnd commit to git before writing the validation:\n\n    git commit -am \"Write link description validation spec\"\n    \n**Write the link description length validation**\n\nThis is another pretty simple validation:\n\n    validates :description, length: { maximum: 180 }\n    \nThat's all it takes to get the spec to pass. That just leaves the url validation.\n\n**Write the url format validation spec**\n\nThe validation spec for the url format isn't really any different from the description length validation:\n\n    it \"is invalid if the url is not a properly formatted HTTP/HTTPS url\" do\n      link.valid?\n      expect(link.errors[:url].any?).to eq true\n    end\n    \nI saved it for last, though, because I need to think through how to write the actual validation itself.\n\n**Write the url format validation**\n\nIn the past, I've used third party gems to validate things like urls and emails. I'd like to get a simple idea of how to write a basic url implementation this time around, so I'm going to write my own format validation.\n\nThe Rails validation for formatting is pretty easy to set up:\n\n    validates :url, format: /regex/\n    \nThe `format` takes a regex pattern and matches it against the `url` attribute. I just need to come up with the regex. Writing regexes is kind of a pain in the ass, so while my research did find a good Ruby way for parsing URLs for a regex matcher [1], I'm still going to write my own simple url regex. I think this is a good learning practice to keep in mind: if I dread doing something complex, I should embrace an opportunity to understand it better. Ideally, this will help make it less dreadful in the future. This also presents a good opportunity to refresh myself on the basics of writing regexes. [2]\n\nThinking through the bare basics of a url format here's what I need to match:\n\n* It needs to start with either `http` or `https`\n* The http/https needs to be followed by `://`\n* Which needs to be followed by zero or more of any characters, possibly followed by a period (so `www.` would work as well as subdomains like `email.example.com` and domains dropping any prefix like `reddit.com`)\n* And ends with a period and at least two or more characters of any kind (to account for the vast number of TLDs we have these days)\n\nWith those rules in mind and with the help of a regex tool, I came up with this very basic url regex:\n\n`/(\\A(http|https))(\\:\\/\\/)(.*\\.?)((\\.{1}.{2,})\\z)/`\n\nI know that this is an imperfect solution for url matching. There are quite a few invalid urls that would still match it. For this early, minimum requirements version stage of the app, though, this matching pattern is sufficient enough. It won't catch everything but it will still reject regular text strings and can catch misspelled a url, perhaps by using the wrong type of slash or leaving out a 't' in the beginning of the url:\n\n* `http:\\\\reddit.com`\n* `htps://reddit.com`\n\nI can always return to this validation later and either write a much more thorough regex, import a validation gem to handle urls, or use the url method I found earlier when researching the problem. For now, this validation will suffice:\n\n    validates :url, format: /(\\A(http|https))(\\:\\/\\/)(.*\\.?)((\\.{1}.{2,})\\z)/\n    \nAnd all of my specs pass, meaning that the default link attribute url is valid and the text string is invalid. This is a good time to commit to git and push to GitHub:\n\n    git commit -am \"Write url format regex and validation\"\n    \n**Next step: refactor my code**\n\nAt this point, I've finished the initial version of the link submission feature \u2013 for what the app needs now, at least. This means I'm nearing the end of my feature cycle:\n\n* Identify the feature to work on\n* Pick a feature action to start with\n* Write specs\n* Write code\n* Repeat for next action until all are complete\n* Validate models\n* Review and refactor\n\nAll that's left, which I'll cover in my next post, is to review my code and refactor where necessary.\n\nIf you'd like to view the source code for the app, you can do so [here](https://github.com/bridge-ro/rankit). Bear in mind that changes in these posts may not have been pushed to the repository yet, depending on when you're reading this.\n\nThank you for reading.\n\n[1] If you want to read the method I found while researching Rails URL validations, you can view it [here on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7167895/rails-whats-a-good-way-to-validate-links-urls#7167988).\n\n[2] This isn't the worst regex I've ever had to write. In my first example app after learning the basics of Rails, I wrote a regex to validate password formats. I wanted it to ensure that a password contained at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one special character. I ended up saving the result in a snippet shortcut so I'd never have to figure it out again:\n\n`/.*(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*[\\d])(?=.*[^A-z\\d]).*/`\n\nAs an absolute beginner at the time, figuring that regex out sucked.",

She's also very aggressive. She constantly bugs myself and the other developer for pointless shit throughout the day. \n\nThe destroying part.. \n\nWe track all of our time using Harvest. Projects are split into design and development tasks. When sites are being designed, assign it to Design task. Etc with development. \n\nHere's the kicker. It'll take me 3 hours to fully design a home page, for example. My boss will have a fuck ton of changes because she \"feels\" like this color should be that color, that she \"feels\" that x or y elements should be laid out different, etc. \n\nShe is not a designer. Every suggestion is opinion based and adds hours upon hours to projects. \n\nAny changes she suggests, I simply do under the Design task as, \"internal changes\". Same goes for client changes. Dock them under \"client changes\". \n\nOn every single project, we are allotted a certain amount of time. \n\n**For design and development, I consistently come in under budget.**\n\nAnd then HOURS UPON HOURS of client and internal changes add up. \n\nShe questioned this. She questioned why so many projects are going over. \n\nFlat out I said, \"it's because of client and internal changes. There are just so many\". \n\nWith interruption, a red face and aggression, she responds with, \"NO. ACTUALLY, IT'S BECAUSE I'M CORRECTING YOUR MISTAKES!\" \n\nI tried explaining how her \"feeling\" in color changes or things being laid out, are not my mistakes. It's her subjective stance on how things look. \n\nAnyway.. I'm fucking tired of it. I do everything under budget, and then she blames all of her changes and all the clients changes on me, framing it in the sense of they're \"my mistakes\". \n\nOh.. And I should add as of today, she has taken away my ability in Harvest to look at project reports. So I can no longer see why projects are going over. \n\nHow the hell can I change this? \n\n---\n\nIt's about 45 minutes from the largest metropolitan city in our country. There's really not a lot of jobs in this current city, and it's close to home. Hence why I haven't looked elsewhere. I really don't want to look for something else, because I can't send the commute.",

My best argument for that is \"learning(js)\", since I'm rookie under one year in javascript world. It is very beneficial approach for me.\n\nI would like some feedback especially on the design part. \n\n1. My idea is of very minimalistic design. All \"animations\" are done in plain CSS.\nAnd for any complex movement or \"animations\" one should use at least canvas. CSS is not for animations, of any kind. \nWith my code, visuals are different and buggy across browser versions/vendors and desktop/mobile. Best visuals are under firefox desktop browser for some reason. In others , like mentioned, not that fluid.\n\n2. Also twitter button is disabled (doesn't do anything), since im writing that lib I was talking about. In design sense  I wanted to achieve better accessibility for older peeps. Like ones that push the touch screen like it has some physical buttons on it (longer touch). And for people that just quickly tap/click the button to have just small visual indication of it. It was done in one css transition. What do you think of it?\n\nThanks, for your time. \n\nEdit: just enabled twitter button animation on mobile devices. Was down, sorry.\n\n",

For every successful API call, retrieve \"monthly calls\" from mysql db and increase by 1.\n\nProblems with this:\n\n* when do I reset the monthly usage if, for example, user started his subscription on September 27th ?\n* uselessly ressource-intensive because of mysql (?)\n* .... ?\n\n2. Every API call is being stored in a log file for other purposes (general monitoring), including user-specific identifier and timestamp. Log files are split into days in order to not create huge files. I can then open log files and select only entries relating to a specific user and show them in a graph as a function of day/month/time of day.\n\nProblems:\n\n* need to open many files which might make things slower ?\n* ... ?\n\n\nAny recommandations would be greatly appreciated :)",

The client is under the impression that this will be a Wordpress site as they need to make edits from time to time. The site is still in the very early stages.\n\nProblem is, I've never used Wordpress. It's probably a necessary thing to learn if I want to be a successful web developer, but I feel learning it on the fly for a client who has already paid isn't ideal.\n\nI'd be more comfortable coding the website from a template I've made, and integrating a very light CMS that I will make myself.\n\nWhat would you do?

It then generates an admin-customizable \"playoff\" style bracket.\n\nIn addition to that, is the forum system, so fans could engage with each other.\n\n-------\n\nThat is the plan, so the question is, what is the best platform to use for that kind of website?\n\nI want to use frameworks or CMS for that since it's much faster than creating a custom one, given that I don't have any experience creating a custom cms (obviously) and using other CMS's/frameworks aside from WordPress, but I'm willing to learn new platforms to build the website.\n\nThanks!",

They are hosting it for free with someone local so only static HTML is allowed... Teaching HTML and CSS is not a practical or timely option for now. \nAnyway. I was looking for some sort of software that allowed them to create and then edit their website. \nI searched for some free WYSYWYG editors but... I like the idea of a CMS. And also the code they output is... well, I think you know. So far I've found 3 options: Siteleaf (www.siteleaf.com), Publii (getpublii.com) and Silex (www.silex.me). I particularly like Publii but their software is still in beta. Hugo, Jekyll and the likes all suffer from a lack of interface or editor so they are also a no go.\nDo you guys recommend something different, from your experience? Preferably free of course.\n",

            "selftext": "This is the sixth post in my series on building a web application from start to finish, focusing on the development process I use when building personal projects. If you'd like to read the other five parts, please see the links below:\n\n* [Introduction](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/71mmph/building_a_web_app_from_start_to_finish_part_1/)\n* [Planning a project](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/71mozr/building_a_web_app_from_start_to_finish_part_2/)\n* [Project setup](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/71tmce/building_a_web_app_from_start_to_finish_part_3/)\n* [Writing the first test](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/725srd/building_a_web_ap_from_start_to_finish_part_4/)\n* [Coding the first feature](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/72f72t/building_a_web_app_from_start_to_finish_part_5/)\n\nThe app that I'm building for this demonstration is a run of the mill reddit/HN-style Rails application called \"[rankit](https://github.com/bridge-ro/rankit).\" As a disclaimer, this isn't intended to be a Rails tutorial. My aim is to re-acclimate myself to Rails development and hopefully help new web devs who are stuck in the \"where do I start?\" phase.\n\nIn my last post, I used failing RSpec tests to help guide me in building the link index feature. This post will focus on finishing the rest of the link CRUD actions.\n\n**Write the create link specs**\n\nWhen I wrote the link listing specs, I needed to create test links in the test database for each spec. That tends to make the create action stick out in my mind as the natural next step, so that's what I like to do after the listing/index feature.\n\nI start by creating a new git branch for the feature and checking it out:\n\n    git branch create_link\n    git checkout create_link\n    \nThen I add a new spec file to the `spec/features` directory called `create_link_spec.rb`. This spec file will describe the process a user takes when submitting a new link. Like with the listing feature, I try to think about how I want this to work from the user's perspective.\n\nFirst, they navigate to the form where they can describe the link they're submitting and paste the url to the site. When they submit the form, the app adds the link to the database and redirects the user to the links index page. From there, the user can see their submission in the link index.\n\nWith that user behavior in mind, I start by writing a `before` block to set up the user's navigation for the specs: a user navigates to the new link submission page, fills in the link details, and clicks a button to submit the link. Then I write specs to cover the three things I expect the app to do in my description above: it should add the link to the database, redirect the user to the index, and show the link in the list.\n\nTo test whether the link was added to the database, I check the count of the `Link` model, which should only have the one link. To test whether the user was redirected to the index page, I check whether the `current_path` of the user is the same as the `root_path`. And to test whether the link is being displayed, I check whether the page has a link with the same text as what the user submitted.\n\nHere's the `create_link_spec.rb` file:\n\n    require 'rails_helper'\n    \n    RSpec.describe \"Submitting a new link\" do\n      before do\n        visit new_link_path\n    \n        fill_in 'Description', with: \"Loose turnip\"\n        fill_in 'Url', with: \"https://looseturnip.gov/\"\n\n        click_button 'Submit Link'\n      end\n\n      it \"adds the link to the database\" do\n        expect(Link.count).to eq 1\n      end\n    \n      it \"redirects the user to the link index\" do\n        expect(current_path).to eq root_path\n      end\n    \n      it \"displays the link in the list of submitted links\" do\n        expect(page).to have_link \"Loose turnip\"\n      end\n    end\n    \nThis is a good time to commit the spec to git as well:\n\n    git commit -am \"Write create link specs\"\n    \n**Create the new action and view template**\n\nWhen the user tries going to the new link page, Rails is going to expect there to be a `new` action in the links controller. The `new` action simply holds an `@link` instance variable that the view template will use to generate the submission form:\n\n    def new\n      @link = Link.new\n    end\n    \nBy convention, the links controller will try to render a view template from `app/views/links/new.html.erb`. I need to create that file, along with a form for the user to enter their submission details:\n\n    <%= form_for(@link) do |f| %>\n      <fieldset>\n        <p>\n          <%= f.label :description %>\n          <%= f.text_field :description, autofocus: true %>\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          <%= f.label :url %>\n          <%= f.text_field :url %>\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          <%= f.submit 'Submit Link' %>\n        </p>\n      </fieldset>\n    <% end %>\n    \nI set the description field to autofocus, which makes things a little easier on the user. I also make sure to set the button text to 'Submit Link', which is what the create link spec is going to look for when I run my tests.\n\nThis is enough for my specs to get past the user's navigation and emulation of the form submission. The problem is that the 'submit' button doesn't actually do anything yet, so I need to set up the create action next.\n\n**Create the create action and redirect the user**\n\nBack in the links controller, I need to define a `create` action. The create action needs to take the user's input from the form and pass it to an `@link` instance variable via `Link.new`. Then the action needs to try saving the record to the database. If everything works correctly, the action needs to redirect the user to the root url where they can see their link on the index page. If something goes wrong and the save method doesn't save the new record, then the action needs to render the new link page again:\n\n    def create\n      @link = Link.new(params.require(:link).permit(:description, :url))\n    \n      if @link.save\n        redirect_to root_path\n      else\n        render :new\n      end\n    end\n    \nIt's important to note that I need to specifically allow Rails to access the parameters from the user's form input, which Rails requires as a safety precaution.\n\nIf I run my specs now, everything passes:\n\n    Submitting a new link\n      adds the link to the database\n      redirects the user to the link index\n      displays the link in the list of submitted links\n\n    Viewing the links index\n      shows a list of submitted websites as links to those sites\n\n    Link\n      has a description\n      has a url\n\n    Finished in 0.4214 seconds (files took 2.06 seconds to load)\n    6 examples, 0 failures\n    \nThis completes the create new links feature, so now I can commit the changes, checkout the master branch, merge the new feature, and push to GitHub:\n\n    git commit -am \"Create new and create actions and view template\"\n    git checkout master\n    git merge create_link\n    git push -u origin master\n    \n**Write the edit link specs**\n\nWith the create action finished, there are two CRUD features left to implement: edit and destroy. I like to follow up the create feature with the edit feature since the two are very similar to write.\n\nOnce again, I start by creating a new git branch and checking it out:\n\n    git branch edit_link\n    git checkout edit_link\n    \nThen I add a new feature spec called `edit_link_spec.rb`. Like with the create feature, I try to think through how the user will navigate through this feature. They'll be visiting the edit link page for an existing link, which shows them a form where they can make changes to the link and submit them. Doing so should update the link with the changes the user made and redirect the user to the link index. In the spec code, I need to set up a test link to be edited, simulate the user navigating to the edit page and changing the link's attributes, and check whether the link's attributes changed and whether the user landed back on the link index page:\n\n    require 'rails_helper'\n    \n    RSpec.describe \"Editing a link\" do\n      let!(:link) { Link.create(link_attributes) }\n    \n      before do\n        visit edit_link_path(link)\n    \n        fill_in 'Description', with: \"Updated description\"\n        fill_in 'Url', with: \"https://looseturnip.gov/updated\"\n    \n        click_button 'Update Link'\n      end\n    \n      it \"updates the link's attributes\" do\n        expect(Link.first.description).to eq \"Updated description\"\n        expect(Link.first.url).to eq \"https://looseturnip.gov/updated\"\n      end\n    \n      it \"redirects the user to the link index\" do\n        expect(current_path).to eq root_path\n      end\n    \n      it \"displays the link's new details in the list of submitted links\" do\n        expect(page).to have_link Link.first.description\n      end\n    end\n\nAs a side note, I have to use `Link.first` in the specs because the `:link` symbol only holds on to the attributes passed in the `.create` method; it does not update to include the edited attributes when I simulate the user's behavior.\n    \n**Create the edit action and view template**\n\nLike I did with the new action, I need to define an edit action in the links controller. This time, though, I need to retrieve the link that the user is editing from the database:\n\n    def edit\n      @link = Link.find(params[:id])\n    end\n    \nAnd like before, I also need to create a view template with a form for the user to change the link's details. For now, I can just copy the same form I used in the `new` action \u2013 later I can refactor my code to remove the duplication. The only change I make is to update the button text from 'Submit Link' to 'Update Link':\n\n    <%= f.submit 'Update Link' %>\n    \nAt this point, I realize that I didn't do my typical git commit after writing the spec. I'll take care of that now:\n\n    git commit -am \"Write edit link specs, create edit action and view template\"\n    \n**Create update action and redirect the user**\n\nThe update action works very similarly to the create action: I specifically permit Rails to update the record using the user's form input and attempt to save the changes to the link. If it works, I redirect the user to the link index. If not, I render the edit page. Like I did with the form, I do this by copying the create action and making the small changes needed to make it work for updating. The focus right now is on getting the code to work properly \u2013 I can refactor the duplication out later:\n\n    def update\n      @link = Link.find(params[:id])\n  \n      if @link.update(params.require(:link).permit(:description, :url))\n        redirect_to root_path\n      else\n        render :edit\n      end\n    end\n    \nThat gets all the specs to pass, finishing the edit feature. Once again, it's time to commit, merge, and push:\n\n    git commit -am \"Create update action\"\n    git checkout master\n    git merge edit_link\n    git push -u origin master\n    \n**Write the delete action specs**\n\nThe last CRUD action to implement is the delete \u2013 or destroy \u2013 action. I start again with a git branch and check it out:\n\n    git branch delete_link\n    git checkout delete_link\n\nThen I add a new spec file to the `spec/features` directory, `delete_link_spec.rb`. Thinking through the feature as a user, I expect to click on a \"delete\" link next to a link on the index page and to have the page reload with the link gone from the list. In the spec file, I set up the link, code the navigation simulation in a `before` blog, and write the specs. I need to determine whether the link was deleted from the database, which I can do by expecting the `Link.count` to be zero. I need to determine whether the user is redirected to the link index, which I can do using the same redirect expectation that I used in my other spec files. And I need to determine whether the link was removed from the index, which I can do by checking that the page does not have a link to the submitted site.\n\nHere's the `delete_link_spec.rb` file:\n\n    require 'rails_helper'\n    \n    RSpec.describe \"Deleting a link\" do\n      let!(:link) { Link.create(link_attributes) }\n    \n      before do\n        visit root_path\n        click_link 'Delete'\n      end\n    \n      it \"deletes the link from the database\" do\n        expect(Link.count).to eq 0\n      end\n    \n      it \"redirects the user to the link index\" do\n        expect(current_path).to eq root_path\n      end\n    \n      it \"removes the link from the list of submitted links\" do\n        expect(page).not_to have_link link.description\n      end\n    end\n    \nThen I commit the spec to git:\n\n    git commit -am \"Write delete link specs\"\n    \n**Add a link to the delete action in the index view**\n\nWhen I wrote the delete specs, I simulated the user clicking a 'Delete' link on the index page. I know this link doesn't yet exist, so the first thing I need to do is add it to the index template:\n\n    <% @links.each do |link| %>\n      <li>\n        <%= link_to link.description, link.url %>\n        <br>\n        <%= link_to 'Delete', link, method: :delete, data: { confirm: \"Are you sure you want to delete this link?\" } %>\n      </li>\n    <% end %>\n    \nI use the `data` option to add an alert that asks the user to confirm that they really do want to delete the link.\n\n**Create the destroy action**\n\nNow that there's a way to start the delete process, I need to code the actual `destroy` action in the links controller. The implementation is pretty simple: I first need to find the link that's being deleted, same as I did in the edit and update actions. Then I just run the `destroy` method on the link and redirect the user to the root url:\n\n    def destroy\n      @link = Link.find(params[:id])\n      @link.destroy\n      redirect_to root_url\n    end\n    \nThat's all there is to the delete feature. All the specs pass, so it's time to go through the git loop again:\n\n    git commit -am \"Add delete link to link index and create destroy action\"\n    git checkout master\n    git merge delete_link\n    git push -u origin master\n\n**No show**\n\nI'm actually still missing a CRUD action here: there's no show action yet. This is because I don't need one right now. Clicking on a link in the index should bring the user to the submitted website, not to a show page for the link.\n\nLater on, when I add comments to links, I'll need a show page where users can type in their comments. For the time being, though, I can leave the show action out.\n\n**Next step: validations**\n\nSince I covered writing a feature with a test-first approach in the previous post, I went through each of the link features pretty quickly this time. I want the focus to be on how I get an app started and the order in which I code features, both in the larger scope (links) and in the smaller scopes (listing, creating, editing, deleting).\n\nTo recap, I start by going through my project plan and picking the core feature of the application. Then I start with the listing/index action of that feature, which covers a decent amount of ground for a starting action. Once that foundation has been laid, I code the other CRUD actions in the following order:\n\n* The show action (which, for this specific example app, wasn't yet necessary)\n* The new/create actions\n* The edit/update actions\n* The delete/destroy actions\n\nOnce I've gotten a larger scope feature fully functional, I like to go back through it and tighten things up a bit. The next step I do, which I'll cover in my next post, is to write and test validations for the model. After that, I review my code and refactor as needed, which I'll cover in the post following validations.\n\nIf you'd like to view the source code for the app, you can do so [here](https://github.com/bridge-ro/rankit). Bear in mind that changes in these posts may not have been pushed to the repository yet, depending on when you're reading this.\n\nThank you for reading.",

It just had tid bits of info and stuff, and I was hosting it on my Github Pages so the only cost he had to worry about was the domain.\n\nOntop of the usual About, Home and Contant page, we have a Quotes and Events page. The club has been unactive since I made the site since they were busy getting everything in check, but now they're going to start doing fundraisers, hosting events, and other small stuff.\n\nSo of course when an event comes up, they'd like it to show up on their page, but the only way I can do that right now is to hard code it into the page. The same goes for what's in our quotes page. But I'm wondering if there's a way to streamline this process and make it less work for everyone.\n\nIf I were able to create a full stack application, this would be a piece of cake, but I'm wondering if there's something I could do that would be entirely free?\n\nThey also requested to have a calendar on the page that would hold all the events. So far I just setup an EventBrite calendar, but it's pretty ugly and not very customizable and to add events, we'd have to create the event in EventBrite as well. Of course we can make the whole page using the widgets that EventBrite gives, but it's not all that customizable.\n\nSo any ideas?\n\nThanks!",

Occasionally I'll need to update customer records and tickets in the field. Sometimes \"the field\" is outside of cell range and I may find myself needing to record information offline, to update when I get online.\n\nMy concept for a solution is this:\n\nOn every keypress in a form, a script will save the form field name and data to local storage. On page load the script will check for keys in local storage that match the form field names and auto-fill the form with any data in local storage. Upon a successful form submission, local storage will be cleared.\n\nObviously, this will only work if I've already got a page loaded so I was looking into full offline page load support and discovered service workers. This looks too good to be true. A couple dozen lines of javascript to cache the page offline? Are there any catches or quirks that I should be aware of? I've read about a half dozen articles on the topic and it seems a little too simple. Unfortunately, I can't go into full test mode until I have a few more features fleshed out so I thought I'd get some feedback here while I work.",

Different department in the system create different forms and update them for patients. Forms gets generated dynamically because there are over 600 forms. Changes in the forms can be from the header, number of columns, number of rows, titles in first column, n input field in next column with some default values in last column etc. with mixes of these variations.\n\nSo far C# i am creating a serialized JSON string and storing that in MSSQL database. While working (Updating the data, printing reports) with the form i m de-serializing it into a JSON object and rendering the form dynamically.\n\nMy question is what is the best way to go for this kind of scenario if i am re-doing this app in **MERN** (I prefer React over Angular) environment? \n\nIf anyone has come across such a situation where they had to create forms dynamically n store them in **MONGODB**, Please share your experience. \n\nThanks in advance.",

The new company dev team are not. They don't see any value in writing tests, pair programming, code review or even taking time to design solutions to problems. We sit at our desks and program without talking to each other and put little thought into design before hacking together the quickest solution. When I ask about possible issues with existing design I am told 'It was easier that way' or 'it works'.\n\nThe app is not heavily used and only used by fairly computer illiterate people which is why I don't think there are currently massive problems. I don't think there is much potential to scale anyways so maybe this will never be a problem.\n\nWhat do I do in this situation? I'm not really learning anything by being here and I'm not confident enough to explain why effort should be put into design and good process when I'm not sure if it will actually have any effect on the business.\n\nAdvice would be appreciated.

I've also run into issues where front end web developer is assumed to be either web designer or front end developer (focus on programming more than front end e.g. .NET)\n\nI have looked at jobs posted in the area but salary ranges on these jobs are often very optimistic so not really accurate enough.\n\nI need accurate data so that I can request a salary review for my team and myself with evidence to show what we are worth. The more data and the better the data is then the more likely my case will be for the review.\n\nAny advice, websites, data would be really appreciated.\n\nI know from past experience that each role is specific to the skill involved so one front end doesn't necessarily equal another.

For my site, I'm wanting to log database changes to an archive table. This table is RecentChange. For each table in my database, for example Game, there would also be a GameRevision table. Each instance of RecentChange would be connected to either a GameRevision, or a SystemRevision, or a whateverRevision, but never more than one. So should the RevisionChange table have a field \"table_type\" which tells it if its for Game or System or whatever, and a field \"revision_id\" that is the id for the whateverRevision? Or should I have a field \"whateverRevision_id\" in the RecentChange table that links directly to the whateverRevision table? But then one could be linked to a Game and a System when it should only be one. \n\nI hope that this explanation makes sense. ",

            "selftext": "Hi all! In about 48 hours I'll have a chance to land my first job in web development. It's a job that, considering the job posting, I am vastly under-qualified for; but, given my first interview with the company President, I think I have a really good shot. I'm looking for advice on what I can do to prepare for this second (and probably final) interview.\n\nA little background: I started getting into Web Development about 6 months ago. I did a Front-End bootcamp program this spring. I have decent HTML, CSS, and JS skills. I have a bit of experience/ familiarity with some JS frameworks (Vue and Ember), but I would not consider myself proficient. \n\nAnyway, fast forward to a couple of weeks ago. The founder of a small-ish marketing agency in town contacts me on linked in asking if I'm interested in a position that they are looking to fill. Of course I'm interested, so we set up a meeting for last week. Going into the meeting, I'm not expecting anything tbh, and I anticipate it being super informal. Since he reached out to me on Linked In, he hasn't seen my resume or portfolio, and I didn't even look at the job posting to check the particulars. I assume since he reached out to me (you can definitely tell from my Linked In page that I am very green in the Web Dev field) that they are looking to fill an entry level position.\n\nLong story short, the interview goes amazingly. The President has a tad bit of tech background, but not much. I didn't BS at all; I told him what I had experience in, and when he brought up tech/languages that they use that I don't know, I told him so. They use Wordpress/PHP, \"no experience, but I would love to learn\". Do I know Jquery, \"no experience, but I would love to learn\". Etc. He understood that I was very knew in the field, but essentially we hit it off so well from a personality standpoint, that I think I managed to convince him that I was the right person for the job. I sold myself as an intelligent, capable, and dedicated individual who would invest in the company if they invested in me. He intimated that they were looking for someone to be at the company for the long haul (so maybe they could invest in someone newer) He seemed very impressed by the end, asked for my salary req. etc. and said he thought it could be a fit. I almost expected him to offer me the job no questions asked. He said we would be in touch about moving forward.\n\nNow, I have a meeting set up for Wednesday that I thought was with two of the devs (turns out it's actually with the \"VP of digital\" and the \"Controller?\"). I'm nervous now that other members of the team may think \"Wow, this guy is really underqualified\". I checked the job posting in the meantime, and it says \"not an entry level position\". As I mentioned, the President and I came to an understanding about my abilities/experience, but I want to make a similarly good impression on these other team members. \n\nMy main question is this: What can I do tech-learning specific (or otherwise) in the next 2 days to prepare for closing on this job? The job posting mentions WordPress skills (back-end and front-end), PHP, MySQL, Jquery, and Bootstrap (in addition to HTML, CSS, and JS, which I am comfortable with). My original intention for posting here was that I thought this second interview was going to be with devs, in which case I thought I needed to have a familiarity with some PHP/Jquery stuff just so I wouldn't have to lie through my teeth. Now it appears that the interview is with the aforementioned team members. Still, I thought the webdev community might have some insight on how to prepare.\n\nSorry for the long wall of text. I appreciate any insight, tips, or otherwise!\n\nTLDR: I have an interview in two days for a position that I'm well underqualified for. I lack experience with WordPress, PHP, MySQL, Jquery, etc. that they are looking for. However, I managed to make a great impression in my first interview with the company founder, and I may be able to lock down the job, based on that connection. ",

            "selftext": "This is the fifth post in my series on building a web application from start to finish, focusing on the development process I use when building personal projects. If you'd like to read the other four parts, please see the links below:\n\n* [Introduction](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/71mmph/building_a_web_app_from_start_to_finish_part_1/)\n* [Planning a project](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/71mozr/building_a_web_app_from_start_to_finish_part_2/)\n* [Project setup](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/71tmce/building_a_web_app_from_start_to_finish_part_3/)\n* [Writing the first test](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/725srd/building_a_web_ap_from_start_to_finish_part_4/)\n\nThe app that I'm building for this demonstration is a run of the mill reddit/HN-style Rails application called \"[rankit](https://github.com/bridge-ro/rankit).\" As a disclaimer, this isn't intended to be a Rails tutorial. My aim is to re-acclimate myself to Rails development and hopefully help new web devs who are stuck in the \"where do I start?\" phase.\n\nIn the previous post, I wrote the first feature spec for listing submitted links. It expects that a user who navigates to the links index page will see a list of links to submitted websites. This post picks up where that last post left off, coding the functionality described in the spec.\n\n**Run the feature spec**\n\nAs I said in my previous post, writing specs first is a great way to guide myself through building an app. I haven't written any application code yet, so my specs will fail when I run them. Each time a spec fails, RSpec will tell me why it failed so I know what I need to do next. The goal is to get the spec to pass, which should mean that the feature, as described, is finished and working properly.\n\nI run the spec in my terminal session:\n\n    rspec\n    \nAnd get the following output, which I've cut down a bit for length:\n\n    Viewing the links index\n      shows a list of submitted websites as links to those sites (FAILED - 1)\n\n    Failures:\n\n      1) Viewing the links index shows a list of submitted websites as links to those sites\n         Failure/Error: let!(:link_1) { Link.create(description: \"This is the website we're cloning\", url: \"https://www.reddit.com/\") }\n     \n         NameError:\n           uninitialized constant Link\n\nThe last line is the important one. It tells me that the spec failed because the `Link` model doesn't exist yet. The answer to the \"what do I do next?\" question is answered: I need to generate the link model.\n\n**Generate the link model**\n\nAs described in the previous post, a `Link` will consist of a `description` and a `url`. I use yet another snippet shortcut for the Rails generator \u2013 `!rg` \u2013 and generate the `Link` model:\n\n    rails g model link description:string url:string\n    \nThen I migrate the database with another snippet shortcut, `!dbm`:\n\n    rails db:migrate\n    \nNow when I run `rspec`, I get the following output:\n\n    Viewing the links index\n      shows a list of submitted websites as links to those sites (FAILED - 1)\n\n    Link\n      add some examples to (or delete) /rankit/source/spec/models/link_spec.rb (PENDING: Not yet implemented)\n      \nThis time there's a new pending spec added to the output. This is because RSpec generates spec files whenever you run the Rails generator. I could have told RSpec not to generate the spec file by passing the `--no-test-framework` option to the Rails generator. I didn't do that, though, because there are a couple of quick model specs I like to write at this point.\n\n**Write link model specs**\n\nIf I open the new `spec/models/link_spec.rb` file, I can see what RSpec generated for me:\n\n    require 'rails_helper'\n    \n    RSpec.describe Link, type: :model do\n      pending \"add some examples to (or delete) #{__FILE__}\"\n    end\n    \nThis is just a placeholder telling RSpec that I haven't implemented the spec yet. Right now, all I want to test is that a new `Link` object has both a description and a url:\n\n    RSpec.describe Link, type: :model do\n      it \"has a description\"\n      it \"has a url\"\n    end\n    \nThese specs are very basic and, on their own, possibly a little useless at the moment. Later on, when I add validations to the app, they'll become more useful.\n\nSimilar to how I wrote the link listing spec, I like to start by setting up a link in the test database. This time, however, I want to do it a little differently. Going forward, I know that a lot of my link-related specs are going to have test links set up at the beginning of the spec. I can shorten the `let!` block a bit by defining a set of default link attributes to use when I set these links up.\n\nWhen I set up my testing tools, I uncommented a line in the `rails_helper.rb` file that allows me to access helper files in a `spec/support` directory. This is a good chance to make use of that function.\n\nI start by creating a new folder called `support` inside the `spec` directory and adding a file to it called `attributes.rb`. Inside that file, I define a method called `link_attributes`, which returns a hash of default attributes for a `Link` object:\n\n    def link_attributes(overrides={})\n      {\n        description: \"Loose turnip\",\n        url: \"https://looseturnip.gov/\"\n      }.merge(overrides)\n    end\n    \nI add an optional `overrides` parameter that defaults to an empty hash and merges it into the attributes hash at the end of the method. This means that if I call `link_attributes` without passing anything to it, it will return the hash with the default values. But if I call the method and pass it a hash with the attribute names and new values, I can override the default values with new ones.\n\nFor example, calling `link_attributes` returns:\n\n    {\n      description: \"Loose turnip\",\n      url: \"https://looseturnip.gov/\"\n    }\n    \nCalling `link_attributes(description: \"Not the default\")` returns:\n\n    {\n      description: \"Not the default\",\n      url: https://looseturnip.gov/\"\n    }\n    \nThis makes the method more flexible, allowing me to create multiple objects with the same default values while picking which attributes I specifically want to change. It also keeps my specs DRY. In the future, if I add a new attribute to the `Link` model, I only need to update the `link_attributes` method in `attributes.rb` to include the new attribute. That change will be included in all of my specs using the method, meaning I don't have to go back and manually add the new attribute to each individual spec.\n\nGoing back to the model spec, I set up a new link to use for the specs:\n\n    let!(:link) { Link.create(link_attributes) }\n    \nThe actual specs themselves will be very basic for now. All I want to do is check that the `description` and `url` attributes are not `nil`:\n\n    it \"has a description\" do\n      expect(link.description).not_to be_nil\n    end\n\n    it \"has a url\" do\n      expect(link.url).not_to be_nil\n    end\n    \nHere's the complete `link_spec.rb` file:\n\n    require 'rails_helper'\n    \n    RSpec.describe Link, type: :model do\n      let!(:link) { Link.create(link_attributes) }\n    \n      it \"has a description\" do\n        expect(link.description).not_to be_nil\n      end\n    \n      it \"has a url\" do\n        expect(link.url).not_to be_nil\n      end\n    end\n    \nThis is an imperfect spec file; it doesn't really protect me against much right now. Still, it is a small assurance that my `Link` model is saving attributes correctly. And I like to get this minimal setup done early so it's ready when I need to do more in-depth model/validation tests later.\n\nThis is when I like to do another git commit:\n\n    git commit -am \"Generate link model, write link specs, add spec support files\"\n    \nNow when I run `rspec`, I get the following output:\n\n    Viewing the links index\n      shows a list of submitted websites as links to those sites (FAILED - 1)\n\n    Link\n      has a description\n      has a url\n      \nMy model specs are passing, so now I can focus on the failing link listing feature.\n\n**Define link and root routes**\n\nRSpec tells me why my link listing feature spec failed:\n\n    Failures:\n    \n      1) Viewing the links index shows a list of submitted websites as links to those sites\n         Failure/Error: visit root_path\n     \n         NameError:\n           undefined local variable or method 'root_path' for #<RSpec::ExampleGroups::ViewingTheLinksIndex:0x00007f9bc5bc1700>\n\nWhen I wrote the link listing spec file, I used a `before` block to simulate the user navigating to the root url of the app, which should bring the user to the link index. The spec is failing because I haven't set up any routes yet, meaning the `root_path` helper doesn't exist.\n\nSo, once again, RSpec is telling me what to do next: I need to define my routes. This is an easy fix (in `routes.rb`):\n\n    root \"links#index\"\n    resources :links\n    \nI like to put my `root` route at the top of the routes file. For links, I know that I'm going to need routes for every CRUD action, so I use a `resources` declaration to define them all at once.\n\n**Generate the links controller**\n\nWith my routes defined, it's time to run my specs again:\n\n    Failures:\n    \n      1) Viewing the links index shows a list of submitted websites as links to those sites\n         Failure/Error: visit root_path\n     \n         ActionController::RoutingError:\n           uninitialized constant LinksController\n           \nRSpec tells me that I haven't generated the links controller yet, giving me my next task (in my terminal session):\n\n    rails g controller links --no-test-framework\n    \nUnlike when I generated the model, this time I pass the `--no-test-framework` option to make sure RSpec doesn't generate a spec file for the controller. The main reason for this is because I haven't done as much testing in controllers before, so I'm not fully sure what would be good to test this early on. Since the controller specs I usually write aren't applicable to what I have at this point, I skip generating the spec file and manually add it later on when needed. With more experience, maybe I'll learn what I should test for controllers early on.\n\n**Create the links index action**\n\nNow that I generated the controller, I run my specs again:\n\n    Failures:\n    \n      1) Viewing the links index shows a list of submitted websites as links to those sites\n         Failure/Error: visit root_path\n     \n         AbstractController::ActionNotFound:\n           The action 'index' could not be found for LinksController\n           \nRSpec tells me that I need to create the `index` action in the `LinksController`, so that's my next step. All the action needs to do for now store all of the links in an `@links` instance variable for the view to display (in `links_controller.rb`):\n\n    class LinksController < ApplicationController\n      def index\n        @links = Link.all\n      end\n    end\n    \n**Create the links index.html.erb view**\n\nWith the `index` action defined, I run `rspec` again:\n\n    Failures:\n    \n      1) Viewing the links index shows a list of submitted websites as links to those sites\n         Failure/Error: visit root_path\n     \n         ActionController::UnknownFormat:\n           LinksController#index is missing a template for this request format and variant.\n     \n           request.formats: [\"text/html\"]\n           request.variant: []\n           \nThis is saying that Rails couldn't find the view template for the `index` action, which by convention should be `index.html.erb`. So, according to RSpec, my next step is to create that file in the `app/views/links` directory. When I create that file and re-run the specs, I get:\n\n    Failures:\n    \n      1) Viewing the links index shows a list of submitted websites as links to those sites\n         Failure/Error: expect(page).to have_link link_1.description\n           expected to find visible link \"This is the website we're cloning\" but there were no matches\n           \nThis is the first failure that has to do with my actual spec expectations. The links are being created in the database and the spec is navigating to the index page and looking for the links. The problem is that the index page is empty. All I need to do to finish this feature is display the links in the `@links` variable on the index page:\n\n    <article>\n      <ul>\n        <% @links.each do |link| %>\n          <li><%= link_to link.description, link.url %></li>\n        <% end %>\n      </ul>\n    </article>\n    \nWhen I run my specs now, everything passes:\n\n    Viewing the links index\n      shows a list of submitted websites as links to those sites\n\n    Link\n      has a description\n      has a url\n\n    Finished in 0.31944 seconds (files took 2.01 seconds to load)\n    3 examples, 0 failures\n    \n**Commit to git, merge to master branch, and push to GitHub**\n\nI've finished the first feature branch, listing the links. This is when I like to commit my changes:\n\n    git commit -am \"Generate links controller, define index action, create links index view\"\n    \nThen I checkout the master branch:\n\n    git checkout master\n    \nAnd use another snippet shortcut \u2013 `!gm` \u2013 to merge the `list_links` branch into the master branch:\n\n    git merge list_links\n\nFinally, if I have a GitHub repo set up for the project, I push my changes to the repo:\n\n    git push -u origin master\n    \n**Thoughts on testing first**\n\nIn this post, I tried to run the specs after each individual step and do exactly what the failure message says, no more than that. This is how I practiced test-driven development when I first started with it. For the sake of this demonstration, I figured that this would be a helpful way to show how testing first can get other beginners past the \"what do I do next?\" issue. In this sense, tests can feel very comfortable when you're coming fresh from tutorials or courses that told you what to do step-by-step.\n\nIn practice, though, I don't do it that way anymore, at least not for very basic actions like the ones in this post. I still write the tests first like I did in this and the previous post. But now, if I already know how to code the entire feature, I'll do so without running the specs after each step. Instead, I run them if I do happen to get stuck or forget what I need to do, and again at the end of the feature to make sure that what I implemented actually works.\n\nThat being said, I try not to code more than what's necessary to make the specs pass. If I notice myself coding something beyond the scope of what I defined in my specs, I stop and write new specs for what I'm adding before I go back to the features.\n\n**Next steps: moving to the next feature**\n\nIn my next post, I'll determine which feature I should work on next and go through the process again: write specs, code features, run specs until they pass, and commit the changes.\n\nGoing forward, to avoid repetitive demonstrations, I probably won't run the specs after each individual step like I did this time, instead focusing on the process of determining which order to work on features as part of the app building process.\n\nIf you'd like to view the source code for the app, you can do so [here](https://github.com/bridge-ro/rankit). Bear in mind that changes in these posts may not have been pushed to the repository yet, depending on when you're reading this.\n\nThank you for reading.",

            "selftext": "I'm a college student with decent programming and WebDev experience. I can do most things given enough time and tutorial sites.\n\nI'm tasked with totally redesigning a WordPress site that hosts hundreds of download pages (each one being a specific item in a hierarchy). There is a very deep and specific directory structure to this site. Currently the site sits on a 2005-era custom theme and relies on several plugins to function. \n\nSo far I've been using the Bridge theme on a fresh WP install, but everything just feels wrong. I feel like every single feature I need to implement has to be shoehorned in with *another* plugin or some theme file hack. \n\nFor example, my boss really liked some third party menu bar but in order to implement it I had to go into the 10,000 line header.php monstrosity of the theme and replace every instance of the default navbar, and it still doesn't work properly on iOS safari. \n\nI dread having to implement masonry item pages or fix mobile layout bugs. The theme is \"full-featured\" but I just feel like it's bloated and can't do anything I actually want it to do (e.g. the built in masonry only works for 'portfolio' items, which by themselves are almost impossible to customize and can't be used for download items). I've run out of things I can do without bashing my head on my desk.\n\nI'm worried that it's already too bloated and that I'll never actually be able to get it in a functioning state in a reasonable amount of time. I've been chugging along and completing tasks but I seriously dread working on more complex features. \n\nI've looked into Wagtail CMS and it looks nice, I can use bootstrap and preserve my sanity as well as customize it much easier than WP. But is this simply a case of the grass always being greener on the other side? I know I'd have to implement lots of things again like the navbar and masonry objects and the actual data structures; I definitely won't have as much hand-holding as I would with WP. \n\nI'm not really too sure what I'm even asking of you guys at this point, but I'm sure that some of you have gone through something similar and/or have relevant advice to share with me. I kind of needed to get this off my chest and evaluate it before moving further. Thanks!",

Now it isn't necessarily a requirement for the app to actually output an HTML file, instead if it outputs the HTML code which was copiable, would be ideal.\n\nI was wondering if it would be possible to build a web app like this in Angular 4 - since I have experience with it - if it is possible what would be the best route to go about doing something like this. Otherwise what other platforms would be ideal to build something like this?\n\nThank you in advanced!",

            "selftext": "A while ago, I made a project that I needed to document. The noob I was, all of the documentation generators I found flew right past me. What the heck is node?? What is Github Pages??  \n\nDocumentation is such a basic and fundamental thing, so I thought we could use an open-source client-side documentation generator anyone can use **and** anyone can access that  \n\n* people who are trying to document non-cs stuff can use and people with disabilities & on IE8 can access.\n* never forces me to touch command line or even JS.\n* doesn't have the clutter of a million small pages.\n* is so customizable I can make it look like I never used a library.\n* is pretty and human-centered.\n* is quick to write and can be learned in 10 seconds.  \n\nThat's why I made [DocsJS](https://hailiax.io/docsjs/) ([Github](https://github.com/Hailiax/DocsJS)). Not once, but thrice: I didn't like the first two attempts.  \n\nIf you think you might use DocsJS now or anytime in the future, please tell me what you think, especially what you don't like.\n  \n(There are a ton of other features like the page URL hash changing while you scroll for easy linking/sharing. Also, this is my first open-source project so pls point out if I'm doing something wrong)\n\n**Edit:** Thanks for the feedback! The bugs pointed out should have been fixed. Changes are live on the website. I'll make some UI changes and double check the bugs before updating/creating a new release on Github. (either 1.0.4 or 1.1.0 depending on the scope of the UI changes)",

However i got some questions that i hope you guys can answer. Here we go:  \n  \n1. From what i've read, Facebook use react partially on their web, and instagram use react completely on their app. So how do you usually decide when/on which part of the web should you use react? Is react usually use to build just a few particular interfaces, or can be use to build the whole web? Which is better?  \n2. Which is the correct way to use the css when build a react project? Import it in the react file? Or import it usually on the html file?  \n3. What is the best file structre for a react project?  \n  \nThank you in advance guys!",

Since my app is a webgame, I'll probably need to sync more in the future.\n\nI'm talking about server->client data flow here, without taking rendering in consideration.\n\nAs I understand it, Redux and MobX provide an alternative for regular pub/sub. Whereas pub/sub can be used for any sort of events, Redux and MobX are more specific and are only concerned with state changes, providing convenient ways of working with them.\n\nI've used both libraries for client-side rendering. It was great: when state changes, your components just react on these changes and re-render automatically.\n\nSo I thought, maybe I could use it for syncing server state as well? E.g. server state (being a Redux or MobX store) changes and connection handlers (currently Socket.IO sockets) just react to it and send the change to clients. Since this is purely about state, it's probably more convenient than manually implementing pub/sub for each part of state that should be synchronized and subscribing handlers to it.\n\nHowever, I have never heard of using Redux or MobX for anything other than rendering (be it client or server-side rendering).\n\nCan anybody give me advice on this matter? Is it a viable approach? If it is, why nobody uses it?\n\nThanks!",

            "selftext": "Hi guys -- this is my first time posting in r/WEBDEV! I am looking to start building a webapp that will serve as a searchable directory; basically a business directory with some extra features. But it definitely will include the basics such as a searchable directory, ability for users to submit listings, user logins, etc. I've been looking into various frameworks that might work for my project, but I'm really not sure what the best route would be. Lots of conflicting thoughts online, as there is definitely no singular right way to do it.\n\n\nI am tied between using Ruby on Rails backend connected to a frontend framework like Angular 2 or Ember via API from the RoR backend, or using either a PHP or JS framework. I want the webapp to be fast, and hopefully not too much of a pain in terms of scalability, should I need to beef things up in the future. I also want to build using something that will be easy to secure and encrypt user data. I haven't ever done something full-stack like this, so I'm hoping to learn quite a bit along the way, and hopefully learn a framework that I can use for future projects.\n\n\nWhat framework would you recommend for a project like this? Would you recommend doing server-side rendering for this type of app? Is there anything specific I should consider when I make the decision between one framework over another for this type of project?\n\n\nIn addition, I am pretty lucky in that I have inherited a hand-me-down tower server that's only a few years old. I was thinking of using that as my dedicated dev machine, and possibly doing the dev inside some virtual machines. Would you recommend this or not? Thanks for your suggestions!",

I've messed with the vh a bit and tried doing 100% height but I'm wondering if there is a better way to stretch the page. \n\nIdeally both columns would have their own scroll bars if content was long enough but still stretch to the page length if the content is small. Help is much appreciated, I am really terrible with CSS.\n\nEdit: Thank you so much /u/RoyKlutman",

            "selftext": "Encountered a strange issue today. I hope this is the right subreddit for this.\n\nI have a web forum, where users can post inline images or link to offsite avatars. I can't really stop them from trying to use HTTP links, and lots of old posts before moving my site to HTTPS did just that, which I didn't want to break.\n\nSo I added Content-Security-Policy: upgrade-insecure-requests to my server headers. Everything I read about this states that it will convert HTTP requests to HTTPS, and if the resource fails to load over HTTP, the request will fail and the page will remain securely HTTPS, with no mixed-content errors.\n\nHowever, today I found a user had an avatar linked to his account that was specified as HTTP. The CSP setting redirected it to HTTPS, but the web server in question, having a valid TLS certificate and HTTPS server running on port 443, responded with a 301 redirect back to the HTTP URI. It boggles my mind why a server would even do this, but it did. Here is the image link in question, which I've made HTTPS so you can try it yourself: https://vgmrips.net/forum/download/file.php?avatar=44.png\n\nHere it is doing its thing in the Firefox network inspector: https://i.imgur.com/UyGTscK.png\n\nChrome and Firefox (but not Safari) happily acknowledge the redirect, load the content, and display it inline on my site. And then proceed to downgrade my site's security rating from \"Secure\" to \"Not Secure\" with the 'scary' warning symbol as a result of the page now having mixed content. Result: https://i.imgur.com/9xe0SY9.png\n\nThe result is that upgrade-insecure-requests cannot be used to guarantee no mixed content, and anyone who can post their own inline images (eg any message board, etc) can break the \"Secure\" rating of any pages their images appear on.\n\nThis is not how upgrade-insecure-requests is advertised in all of the literature on the subject! In my view, it makes this tag completely unworkable from a security standpoint.\n\nI had to move my web forum over to Content-Security-Policy: block-all-mixed-content to resolve this issue. Which unfortunately will not redirect HTTP requests to HTTPS, even though for most image-hosting servers this works just fine. And the fact that this *does* block the HTTPS->HTTP redirect attempt from the above link tells me that this sort of detection is not only possible, but already implemented in browsers. Just not for upgrade-insecure-requests. Why not?\n\nMy question is: is this really the desired behavior of upgrade-insecure-requests? Or is this a protocol downgrade security vulnerability in these two browsers?\n\nIf the former, all of the sites explaining this header value really need to be updated. Really, I see very little value in using upgrade-insecure-requests if this is desired functionality, unless all links are internal and it's just apathy to update one's site.\n\nIf the latter, how should I go about getting the word out about this?\n",

Also, there are features like lobby and groups.\n\nI'm already using Socket.IO for updating the game state and list of ongoing games in real time. But there are also actions that are sent by the player (press a button during gameplay, or join a game in the lobby, or join a group). I can use socket.io for this as well, or I can use regular HTTP with REST-like API.\n\nAs I understand, the only downside of the former approach is that I need to implement my own protocol on top of Socket.IO if I need to return responses from the server. This is trivial, though (just two functions, `addRequestHandler` and `sendRequest`, I already implemented them). Also, the server will need to always maintain the connections. But websocket connections may actually turn out cheaper than tons of clients polling it every few seconds with a GET, so this point is questionable.\n\nAre there other downsides in using Socket.IO for simple requests? Which factors should influence my choice here? Should I stick with one way of communication or use both?\n\nThanks!",

            "selftext": "This is the fourth post in my series on building a web application from start to finish, focusing on the development process I use when building personal projects. If you'd like to read the other three parts, please see the links below:\n\n* [Introduction](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/71mmph/building_a_web_app_from_start_to_finish_part_1/)\n* [Planning a project](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/71mozr/building_a_web_app_from_start_to_finish_part_2/)\n* [Project setup](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/71tmce/building_a_web_app_from_start_to_finish_part_3/)\n\nThe app that I'm building for this demonstration is a run of the mill reddit/HN-style Rails application called \"[rankit](https://github.com/bridge-ro/rankit).\" As a disclaimer, this isn't intended to be a Rails tutorial. My aim is to re-acclimate myself to Rails development and hopefully help new web devs who are stuck in the \"where do I start?\" phase.\n\nThis post will focus on adding the first feature to the application \u2013 listing submitted links on the index page \u2013 using a test-first approach.\n\n**Pick the first feature to code**\n\nIn my previous post, I talked about how my planning file helps me determine where to get started with a new project. I didn't exactly give a practical explanation of how it does so.\n\nAfter I write a planning file, I like to look through it and determine what the \"core feature\" of the application is. That is, which feature is the one that's absolutely necessary for the app to deliver what the overview promises? Which feature do most or all of the other features build on top of? In most cases, this is the first feature I work on.\n\nIn the case of this reddit clone example, the core feature is easy to determine: it's the links. The whole point of the app is to share links. Without links, the app has no purpose, so that's the feature I need to add first.\n\nThat helps narrow down the \"where do I get started?\" question a little bit. But the \"links\" feature itself has multiple actions that need to be coded \u2013 the CRUD actions of create, read, update, and delete. I could also think of these actions in terms of the pages in the application: a page that lists all the submitted links, the page where a user creates a new link, the page where a user can edit a link, a button to delete a submission, etc. So the \"where do I get started?\" question still hasn't been fully answered.\n\nThe approach I use for a basic CRUD app is to start with a feature for listing created items. The listing \u2013 or index \u2013 feature will force me to generate both the model and controller for the feature, along with the index, new, and create actions. Since it covers that much ground, I find it to be a comfortable starting point.\n\nFor disclosure, I didn't figure out this starting point by myself. I want to give credit to the [Pragmatic Studio](http://pragmaticstudio.com/) \"Learn Ruby On Rails\" course for this approach, along with introducing me to test-first development. Some of the ways I write tests also come from the book [Rails 4 Test Prescriptions](http://a.co/8ftB9m1), which I'll recommend for any other Rails devs reading this.\n\n(Neither of those are affiliate/referral links if you're worried about that sort of thing.)\n\n**Create a feature branch in git**\n\nThe first thing I try to do when starting work on a feature is to create a new git branch for the feature. That way, if I make any major mistakes or go down a dead-end path, I can easily revert to the master branch and work on something else.\n\nI say try because I didn't always remember to do this. My knowledge of and ability in git is pretty basic, so hopefully I'll improve at this over time.\n\nI'm not sure how most people approach feature branches. Do they create a branch for a larger scope of a feature, like \"links\" as a whole? Or do they focus on smaller scopes within a specific feature, like \"creating links\"? I've done both approaches in the past and I prefer the smaller scope one myself. When dealing with the \"where do I start?\" and \"what do I do next?\" issues, I find smaller scopes less intimidating and more motivating; merging each branch feels like real progress is being made.\n\nI start by using another snippet shortcut \u2013 `!gb` \u2013 to create a git branch for listing links:\n\n    git branch list_links\n    \nThen I use a shortcut \u2013 `!go` \u2013 to checkout the new branch:\n\n    git checkout list_links\n    \nAny changes I make won't affect the master branch. When I'm done with the new feature, I merge the feature branch into the master branch and push the changes to GitHub.\n\n**Write the first feature spec**\n\nRSpec will generate tests for things like models and controllers when you generate those resources in Rails. Those tests aren't good for covering features from the perspective of a user navigating through an application. The first thing I do is create a folder in the `spec` directory called \"features\", which is where I'll put my specs that describe how a user will use each feature of the app.\n\nIn that `features` directory, I start the first feature off by creating a spec file called `list_links_spec.rb`.\n\nEach RSpec file should start by importing the `rails_helper.rb` file, which I've created yet another snippet shortcut for (`!rh`):\n\n    require 'rails_helper'\n    \nI try to think through features specs from the perspective of the user \u2013 what are they looking at, what are they doing, what should they be seeing, and what should be happening? For a list of submitted links, the user should be looking at the links index page and seeing a list of links that people have submitted. Looking at that sentence, I can already see an RSpec description and spec expectation. Starting with \"the user should be looking at the links index page\", I get:\n\n    RSpec.describe \"Viewing the links index\" do\n    end\n    \nMoving on to the next part of the sentence, \"and seeing a list of links that people have submitted\", I get:\n\n    it \"shows a list of submitted websites as links to those sites\"\n    \nFiguring out which tests to write isn't always this easy but following this sort of approach can help out quite a bit. There may be more specs needed for a feature later on but, like I said earlier, I like to focus on smaller scopes and finish one thing at a time.\n\nReading the spec itself \u2013 `it \"shows a list of submitted websites as links to those sites\"` \u2013 I know that the spec is assuming that a few links have already been submitted. That means I need to set those links up for the test to use. To do this, I like to use the `let!` method in RSpec to create the links outside of the spec. That way, if I add more specs later on, I'll already have some links set up to use.\n\nSetting up the test link objects also forces me to think about what a `Link` actually is. For any model at this stage, I don't try to think through everything single attribute that the model will have. New attributes may pop up later and I may even determine that some attributes aren't necessary. Instead, I try to think of the simplest version needed for what the app can do now, which I can build on later if necessary.\n\nIn this case, however, the simplest version of a link is probably very close to what the final version may be. I know a link needs to have a description so users will know what the link is and where it will take them. I also know that a link \u2013 being a link to a website \u2013 will need a URL to the website that a user is submitting. This means that, for now, a `Link` is going to consist of a `description` and a `url`. To ensure that the index page will display unique links correctly, I'll set up three of them to use in the spec:\n\n    let!(:link_1) { Link.create(description: \"This is the website we're cloning\", url: \"https://www.reddit.com/\") }\n    \n    let!(:link_2) { Link.create(description: \"Also similar in concept to this site\", url: \"https://news.ycombinator.com/\") }\n    \n    let!(:link_3) { Link.create(description: \"Loose turnip\", url: \"https://looseturnip.gov/\") }\n    \nThe `let!` method ensures that the code block runs, creating each link in the test database, and turns each symbol \u2013 like `:link_1` \u2013 into a simple variable I can access in all of the specs. I personally like this approach because I find it to look cleaner than using instance variables.\n\nNow that I've got my example links set up, I try to think about the navigation aspect of the spec; how did the user get to this page? Looking at the `describe` block of the spec:\n\n    RSpec.describe \"Viewing the links index\"\n    \nThe user is viewing the `index.html` page for links. For this spec \u2013 and any others I may add \u2013 I can probably assume that the user has navigated to the index page before taking whatever actions I'm testing in each spec. I also know that I want the root url of the app to show the link index, meaning that users can (theoretically) go to \"rankit.com\" [1] to view all the submitted links. I need to describe that navigation in the spec, which RSpec and Capybara make very simple. I like to do this in a `before` block, which will run before each spec to simulate this navigation:\n\n    before do\n      visit root_path\n    end\n    \nAll that's left now is to write the actual expectation of the spec: what is supposed to happen when using this feature? Reading the spec again:\n\n    it \"shows a list of submitted websites as links to those sites\"\n    \nThe user is expecting to see links to submitted websites. In RSpec, we're going to expect that the page has an HTML link to each of the submitted links in the database. The text of the link should match the description of the link that the user gave when submitting it:\n\n    expect(page).to have_link link_1.description\n    expect(page).to have_link link_2.description\n    expect(page).to have_link link_3.description\n    \nPutting it all together, the spec file describes pretty much the entire basic process of the app's core feature: users submit websites with descriptions to the database, and other users go to the app to see links to those websites. Here's the complete `list_links_spec.rb` file explaining this process as a spec:\n\n    require 'rails_helper'\n    \n    RSpec.describe \"Viewing the links index\" do\n      let!(:link_1) { Link.create(description: \"This is the website we're cloning\", url: \"https://www.reddit.com/\") }\n      let!(:link_2) { Link.create(description: \"Also similar in concept to this site\", url: \"https://news.ycombinator.com/\") }\n      let!(:link_3) { Link.create(description: \"Loose turnip\", url: \"https://looseturnip.gov/\") }\n    \n      before do\n        visit root_path\n      end\n    \n      it \"shows a list of submitted websites as links to those sites\" do\n        expect(page).to have_link link_1.description\n        expect(page).to have_link link_2.description\n        expect(page).to have_link link_3.description\n      end\n    end\n    \nAt this point, having finished the first feature spec, I like to commit the changes to git before moving to the next step:\n\n    git commit -am \"Write link index spec\"\n    \n**Next step: coding the first feature**\n\nThe benefit of test-driven development is that it forces me to think through how a user will use an application, which helps me determine what I need to do first when I start a new project. When writing specs, I'm also thinking about how each step will be expressed in Rails \u2013 what I'll need to generate, how I'll need to present the data, etc. Even if I didn't think about those things, running the tests will directly tell me what to do. When a test fails, RSpec will tell me why it failed, meaning that's the next thing I need to do. It's almost like being given a step-by-step process to follow for coding the app.\n\nThis isn't just an exercise for telling me how to build the app. The specs also give me an extra layer of security throughout the lifetime of the app. If I make any changes to the code in the future, I can re-run all my specs to make sure everything still works correctly. If anything fails, I'll know exactly where I broke the app, meaning I'll know exactly what I need to fix and where to fix it (in most cases; it's not always that simple).\n\nRunning tests can also reveal things I may not have known I needed to do yet when I first wrote the specs, which I'll cover in my next post.\n\nIf you'd like to view the source code for the app, you can do so [here](https://github.com/bridge-ro/rankit). Bear in mind that changes in these posts may not have been pushed to the repository yet, depending on when you're reading this.\n\nThank you for reading.\n\n[1] I say theoretically as in \"if this were a real app on the web\" and because I don't actually own this domain. Apparently, Visa owns rankit.com. I wonder why...\n\nEDIT: Changed the \"rankit\" link since reddit converted the full URL to the link owned by Visa.",

I understand it conceptually and have had success with Laravel in the past but the entire deployment and dev ops involved always makes me overwhelmed so I end up favoring serverless services like Firebase. The problem is as my side projects get more complex, I run into unnecessary complexity regarding my data and wish I had picked a traditional back-end solution.\n\nThat all being said I am really interested in the following language/frameworks:\n\n- Elixir + Phoenix\n- Go\n- ASP Core\n- Python + Django\n\nFor my front-end experience I tend to lean angular but recently have been absolutely loving the functional paradigm of React. So I am open to both functional and OOP programming languages.\n\nEssentially what I want is something that is batteries included and just lets me get my ideas out instead of getting decision paralysis and worried about the dev ops side of things. MeteorJS is a very great example of this as it handled alot of BS for me and let me just get to work but I want to avoid JS.\n\nBefore people suggest NodeJS/express I should mention I don't like JS on the server specifically the middle-ware architecture. I also want to learn something out of my comfort zone to see if the grass is greener.\n\nThis is for personal use - I am not trying to become employed as a BE developer.\n",

            "selftext": "I made a Firefox addon that integrates into YouTube. Since the layout updated, the addon no longer works, and I am in the process of updating it.\n\n\nIn looking over the new HTML, I see a lot of custom elements. Apparently that's a thing. I have a few questions regarding them:\n\n\n* The HTML now seems much more complex. Is this a possible reason for the decision to use all these custom elements? I imagine that custom elements are easier to update rather than picking apart a lengthy HTML document?\n* There are a number of \"*-renderer\" elements that, well, render stuff. When they are instantiated / read (whatever is happening), they become the parent element of more HTML that they create. What is the point of having these renderers? Do they improve modularity / ease of future modification?\n* With respect to these renderers, I have been using them myself, but don't know if there is a better way to do so. I have basically been chaining together MutationObserver s: (A) Inject renderer-a (B) Listen for child node modification (C) Find parent of renderer-b (D) Repeat. Any suggestions on better approaches?",

I'm no expert, and my previous work history has consisted mainly of grunt-level work (Basic HTML and CSS, rarely JS). However, I've worked on my own, outside of work and classes, to learn more about JS, as well as both back end and front end tech such as Node/Express, Angular, even as far as building projects using Passport and learning about how that works. I guess sometimes it takes looking back at where you started to realize how far you've come.\n\nI was extremely nervous after my interview. It was to the point of my anxiety flaring up and having some pretty serious emotions raging, because I've been shot down pretty hart more than a few times from positions that I really was excited to pursue. But not this time. Apparently, I was a prime candidate, to put it simply. It's an extraordinary feeling to know hard work has led somewhere.\n\nSo I want to extend my thanks to the community here for providing some feedback on issues I've had in the past, as well as offering some tips for interviews such as this one! And to the early devs that are in the same place as I was not long ago: **keep at it**. I also thought I was never going to \"get there\", I thought that a normal shmuck like me couldn't possibly reach that next step that seemed so far out of reach - but now I'm one giant step further, aren't I? So keep it up. After all, it's not about the destination, it's about the journey! \n\nBest wishes",

            "selftext": "This is the third post in my series on building a web application from start to finish, focusing on the development process I use when building personal projects. If you'd like to read the other two parts, please see the links below:\n\n* [Introduction](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/71mmph/building_a_web_app_from_start_to_finish_part_1/)\n* [Planning a project](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/71mozr/building_a_web_app_from_start_to_finish_part_2/)\n\nThe app that I'm building for this demonstration is a run of the mill reddit/HN-style Rails application called \"[rankit](https://github.com/bridge-ro/rankit).\" As a disclaimer, this isn't intended to be a Rails tutorial. My aim is to re-acclimate myself to Rails development and hopefully help new web devs who are stuck in the \"where do I start?\" phase.\n\nIf you're interested in learning Rails, I'd be happy to provide some great learning resources. If you're an experienced dev reading this and you notice something I'm doing wrong or poorly, I'd certainly love to hear your feedback/corrections.\n\nThe focus of this post is on how I set up my new projects.\n\n**Setting up a project directory**\n\nThe first thing I do when starting on a new project is create a folder named after the name of the project, if I've already got a name for it. If I don't yet have a name for it, I'll call it something descriptive \u2013 for example \"link-sharing.\"\n\nThen I'll go into the new folder and create a markdown file called \"planning.md\", which is where I complete the project planning template I covered in my previous post. I store this template as a snippet in a Mac app called \"Dash\" so I can generate a blank template with a simple text shortcut:\n\n    !plan\n\nWhen I type that out, Dash will replace it with the entire planning template. Then I can plan out my project idea using the process I described last time.\n\n**Generating the Rails app**\n\nOnce I've got the plan finished, I open a terminal, `cd` into the project directory, and run my snippet for generating a new Rails app:\n\n    !rn\n    \nThat snippet generates a generic `rails new` command that I use for all of my apps:\n\n    rails new source -T\n    \nThe actual Rails app is called source, which I use for the simplicity of the snippet (it also makes it easy to keep all of my project directories consistent). The `-T` option tells Rails not to generate the default MiniTest framework since I use RSpec for testing.\n\n**Committing to git**\n\nOnce I've created the source app, I `cd` into the `source` and run my initial commit. One difference I've noticed lately since I last used Rails is that Rails seems to run the `git init` for you now, which saves some time. So now all I do is use some more snippet shortcuts \u2013 `!ga` and `!gc` \u2013 to commit the project to git:\n\n    git add .\n    git commit -am \"Inital commit\"\n\n**Setting up testing tools**\n\nIn my previous post, I talked about how I used my planning file as a way to figure out where I should start with a new project. That helps with getting started but I still struggled with another issue that seems common among beginners: knowing what to actual do to implement each feature. Then I learned more about Rails testing and test-driven development in the later months of my Rails run, which helped immensly with the \"what do I do next?\" problem.\n\nIf you're a beginner and you don't know about test-driven development, you really should look up a tutorial or grabbing a book on the subject. It's a process that can help give you step-by-step instructions on what you need to do next. If you're a Rails dev, I highly recommend the book [Rails Test Prescriptions](http://a.co/7gDEFQR) (this is not an affiliate link, if you're worried about that sort of thing). That link is for Rails 4 but it still teaches the right stuff. The author is releasing a new edition for Rails 5, which I believe is coming out later this year.\n\nI'll provide code examples of the tests I use, though my focus will be more on explaining what I'm testing rather than how I'm testing it. Another disclaimer: I was pretty new to testing when I left off on coding last year, so my tests are very likely quite basic right now. I'm very open to suggestions and feedback/corrections.\n\nAll that being said, the next step I take is to install a couple testing gems and do so light configuration for them. This early on I just use two gems: RSpec, which is the actual testing gem, and Capybara, which provides some easy helpers for interacting with web pages inside of tests.\n\nFirst, I go to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org/) and search for RSpec. The one I'm specifically looking for is `rspec-rails`, which is usually a bit down the list of search results. I then copy the gemfile code and add it to my gemfile in the `:development, :test` group:\n\n    gem 'rspec-rails', '~> 3.6', '>= 3.6.1'\n\nNext I search for Capybara, copy the gemfile code, and add it to a new `:test` group in my gemfile:\n\n    gem 'capybara', '~> 2.15', '>= 2.15.1'\n    \nWhile I'm in the gemfile, I also clean up some of the generated comments to make things a bit more readable.\n\nOnce I've added the gems to the gemfile, I go back to my terminal and install them:\n\n    bundle install\n    \nAnd run the Rails generator to install RSpec:\n\n    rails generate rspec:install\n    \nThis sets up the spec directory along with the RSpec helper files. Once RSpec is installed, I like to make a few small configuration changes.\n\nOne file that RSpec adds to the root app directory is `.rspec`. This file is where you can add RSpec option flags to run by default whenever you use the `rspec` command. I like to add two additional flags:\n\n    --format doc\n    --color\n    \nThe first formats RSpec's test results in a way that I find easier to read. The other adds color output in the terminal. I believe RSpec now already does this by default but I add the flag just to make sure.\n\nMy other two configurations both take place in the `spec/rails_helper.rb` file. The first is to un-comment the code on line 23, which allows you to add a `support` subdirectory to the `spec` directory where you can put in additional helper code for your tests:\n\n    Dir[Rails.root.join('spec/support/**/*.rb')].each { |f| require f }\n    \nThe second is to add a backtrace filter to RSpec. I usually add this after line 54:\n\n    config.backtrace_exclusion_patterns << /\\/lib\\//\n    \nOne thing that irked me when I started TDD was how many backtraces would clutter up the terminal when a test failed. Each backtrace shows you the files where your code failed, which can be a lot in a Rails app. I found the backtraces to be distracting \u2013 I had to scroll through a lot of noise to read why my tests failed. The above filter removes almost all of the backtraces when running specs. If I do get an error that I need to look at the backtraces to help figure out, I can always comment out the filter and re-run the tests.\n\nAt this point, I'll generally run another commit:\n\n    git commit -am \"Install and set up test tools\"\n    \n**Next steps**\n\nThis completes my basic project setup, at which point I'm ready to start coding the first features of the app. My next post will focus on writing the link submission feature of the app following the test-driven approach.\n\nIf you have any questions, please comment below and I'll try to answer them as soon as I can.\n\nIf you want to take a look at where the app stands so far, you can view the code [here](https://github.com/bridge-ro/rankit).\n\nThank you for reading.",

            "selftext": "Hey everyone! I'm a bit of a noob to web development (besides like REST apis for my company), so this whole deployment thing is something I definitely could use some help on.\n\nSo last week I decided to create a personal web resume site. Since I'm a .NET dev primarily, I did it in ASP MVC just to show I know this thing exists and I can do crap on it. \n\n- My host is Azure, running on the \"shared\" tier. \n- ASP MVC site published directly there via visual studio\n- My domain host is Google Domains.\n- I set up the DNS records based on Microsoft tutorials for using a custom domain with an Azure site. This was all done on the Google Domains website under their DNS tabs. I have an A Record pointing to the websites IP address given in the Azure dashboard, and 1 CNAME record for host 'www' pointing to my website's URL. Both have 1 hour TTLs (the default).\n- No SSL set because the low end Azure stuff doesn't support SSL. This could be my issue?\n\nThe site itself has no actual inputs. It's a header bar with some tabs, a lot of text and a couple of pics, and a bunch of CSS. That's it.\n\nAnyhow, I can browse around to it all day on my phone, home network, etc. But when I get to work, which utilizes Cisco's Umbrella client, it gets blocked with the message \"This site is blocked due to a security threat\". \n\n- \"This site is blocked due to a security threat that was discovered by the Cisco Umbrella security researchers\". \n- In diagnostic info it's showing Host: malware.opendns.com\n- Block Type is \"Security\".\n\nSo, with this in mind, I shuffled across the net and saw Geekflare made a page listing 12 great online site scanners. Among them are like SUCURI, SSL Labs, etc. So I ran most of them. All the ones that did malware scanning came back with 0 issues. Big green checks and a happy all clear message on each. SSL Labs did report a certificate name mismatch, expecting Azure and I guess getting my registered domain via Google Domains.\n\nSo this is where I am. I am concerned that, being that this is a resume site for a developer, if a perspective employer also has Cisco's Umbrella security that they will see it blocked and pass me right on over. So I want to figure out WHAT I did, but I have no idea. \n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions on good ways to handle this issue?\n\nThanks!",

Styling that timeline is no problem, but I don't know what the best way of marking it up semantically is.\n\nBasically, I need two columns, with a label at the top of each. The labels correspond to a year and events that happened in that year. I considered a table, since it has table headings, but I'm also thinking of inserting a `figure` in the middle, so the data doesn't look so monotonous. I'm guessing that would rule a table out, but I don't know what else to use.",

            "selftext": "Hey r/webdev! This is gonna be crossposted to r/webhosting. I wanted to see if anybody here would have some input.\n\ntl;dr: What's the best way to set up a dev/staging site and then launch it to production/live without the client's site going down?\n\nI have been building sites for around 10 years or so, mainly on the front-end. Over the past 5 years I've begun building WordPress sites and PHP-based applications. Fairly simple shit. Up until about a year and a half ago I had been working in a larger company in the marketing department and had the luxury of having a dedicated IT team of web developers, server guys, and all that jazz. I've since branched out and am now working for a small agency building WordPress based sites for local small businesses. \n\nI can build the sites. That isn't the issue. The issue comes when I'm in the cPanel/hosting dashboard crap. In the past, I'd build it all up and then send an email to my IT folks and be like \"example.com is ready to go live\" and they'd be like \"Word, son. I'm on that ish like Miracle Whip on my Wonder bread.\" Give it a little time and BOOM, the site's up and running. When I try to do it, shit just breaks.\n\nYou see, I'm self-taught in all this. I was an Army MP and when I got out of the Army I went and got me a business degree. Kinda just been learning as I go.\n\nBear in mind that I'm inheriting the hosting/domain management. I'm limited on what I'm able to change for now.\n\nWhat I currently do:\n\n1) Set up an add-on domain through the GoDaddy cPanel for our business hosting plan. (*example.com*)\n\n2) I then create a subdomain for the dev environment (*dev.example.com*)\n\n3) Using FTP (Filezilla) I upload WordPress and build the site out\n\n4) Client and colleagues can view the site as I'm working on it and everybody's happy\n\n5) Client and management approve the site\n\n6) I download a backup of the site's files from FTP and a database backup from phpmyadmin\n\n7) I upload the dev version to site's root and this is usually where shit breaks. Filezilla will get hung up on a file and I'll have to stop it and go through and upload folder by folder instead of just selecting the all-encompassing folder and letting it do it's thing.\n\nI feel like there is an easier method to all this and I'm straight up making shit difficult for absolutely no reason other than ignorance. In my head I'm trying to work out how that IT department was able to make these staging sites visible only to the folks that needed to view the site while it was being built and then flip the hypothetical switch and make it live when it was ready. \n\nThanks in advance for any help/tips/advice, I really appreciate it!",

However, it is not completely random, as the angle between two lines (aka drunkeness) determines how straight or queer the path might get.\n\n**How:**\nI built this web app without any dependencies in a single index.html file using vanilla JS/CSS/HTML and a Base 64 encoded favicon image. It was quite easy to do, yet a lot of fun to develop. I tried to use as many pure functions as possible to decrease the amount of state I have to maintain. I also tried to make the code as readable as possible (although there is definitely room for improvement), which brings me to my next point:\n\n**Contributing:**\nFor those looking for some \"recreational programming open-source work\", please feel free to make a pull-request for a more efficient path-finding algorithm, which for now just consists of randomly generating a point around the previous one and comparing angles until their difference falls inside a specific range (--> drunkeness), which could take forever in theory. (see the `while (true)` loop). This is why I have commented 3 additional \"Distance\" options with >500,000 points, because they take a very long time to calculate and possibly the amount of data inside the <textarea> could also become problematic. For other TODOs please take a look at the [README](https://github.com/dag0310/drunk-gps-simulator).\n\n**Testing the path in \"real-life\":**\n[Using this Map Tool](https://www.darrinward.com/lat-long/) (not made by me) you can copy-paste the lat/lon data there and see it in action. Of course it only really makes sense in the desert, as the algorithm does not care about such things as houses, rivers, military bases, open manhole covers, etc.\n\n**Fun:**\nPlease also feel free to share any funny/weird/NSFW generated images or https://pastebin.com/ links to GPS lat/lon data to recreate it in the app. E.g. Paste [this](https://pastebin.com/4KfaphR2) into the textarea to see how ungrateful the app is to me.\n\nEdit:\nShoutout to /r/me_irl for helping me [reach 10 karma](https://www.reddit.com/r/me_irl/comments/71qb42/me_irl/) points so I could submit this post :)",

            "selftext": "This is the second in a series of posts on building a Rails app from start to finish. You can read the first post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/71mmph/building_a_web_app_from_start_to_finish_part_1/), which explains the intention of this series. In short, I started Rails a couple of years ago, took a long break, and now I'm trying to re-introduce myself to the Rails development process \u2013 and, hopefully, help other beginners who are stuck at the \"where do I start?\" phase.\n\nFor this series, I'm going to build a very simple and unoriginal reddit/HN clone app called \"rankit\". I chose that overused example because it's pretty basic, which makes it perfect for getting myself back in the swing of things. Plus a basic app will make it easier to focus on how to get started building an app for the first time.\n\nI want to add a disclaimer here that this isn't quite a tutorial. I still consider myself a beginner and my intention isn't to teach Rails but to provide an example of a start to finish development process. If you're interested in learning Rails, I'd be happy to recommend some great learning resources for beginners. If you're an experienced dev, I'd love your feedback or corrections on any mistakes I make.\n\nThis post will cover the first step in my personal project process: planning the application.\n\nThe biggest problem I faced when starting in web development was feeling overwhelmed at the thought of starting a new app. It's hard, as a beginner, to look past the size of a complete app \u2013 even one smaller in scope \u2013 to see the step-by-step path to building it. Over time, I came up with a planning file template that followed similar planning steps that I saw or read online.\n\nI try not to spend too much time on a planning file. The purpose of the plan is to break the full app down into specific models and features so I can get a better idea of where to start. To that end, my planning template has five sections:\n\n1: Overview\n\n2: Features\n\n3: Data Models\n\n4: Minimum Requirements\n\n5: Progress\n\n**Overview**\n\nThis section contains a description of what the application will do, which I'll use to extract features and data models in the following sections. I try to keep it around 2-3 paragraphs long, which is usually easy with basic starting app ideas.\n\nThe overview is the ideal, fully-featured version of the web app. Even if I don't yet know how to implement a feature, I'll include it if it's something I would like the app to do in a perfect world. The \"minimum requirements\" section will break the \"perfect world\" app down into a smaller scope, \"ready for launch\" version that's less intimidating to start working toward.\n\nAs an example, here's the overview I created for rankit:\n\n> rankit is an example reddit clone application for sharing interesting websites. Users can submit links, comment on them, vote them up or down, and earn karma based on the votes that their submissions receive.\n\n> The rankit homepage will list all of the user submitted links, sorted by the voting rank of each link. The rank of a link will use an algorithm to ensure a good mix of top rated and new content. Users can also choose to sort links by age (newest first), upvote score, and downvote score.\n\n> Each user will have their own user profile displaying their karma score with the option to edit or delete their account. Their profile will also show their top 3 submissions to the site.\n\n**Features**\n\nThis section is where I read through my overview and try to extract all of the features being described. I do this by looking for user actions in the description and supplementing them with things that are a given in most web apps. For example, I didn't specifically mention editing links in the overview but I know that updating items is a part of any general CRUD app. Like the overview, I try to include all of my \"in a perfect world\" features, even if I'm not sure how to implement them yet.\n\nThe features list doesn't have to be exhaustive. I'll sometimes go back and add things that I may have forgotten the first time. It can also serve as a sort of checklist for the app; sometimes I'll delete items that I've implemented so I can focus on what I still need to do.\n\nHere's the initial features list I came up with for rankit:\n\n* Users can post links to websites with a short description of the site\n* Users can edit and delete their submitted links\n* Users can view and visit links submitted by all users\n* Users can upvote links that they like\n* Users can downvote links that they don't like\n* Users can see the voting rank of submitted links\n* Users can comment on links\n* Users can edit and delete their comments\n* Users can view comments from other users\n* Users can gain or lose karma depending on the upvotes and downvotes of their submissions\n* Users can visit user profiles\n* Users can see the karma scores of other users on their profiles\n* Users can edit and delete their accounts\n* Users can see the top 3 submissions of other users on their profiles\n* Links can be sorted\n* Links will have a sorting algorithm for top rated submissions that factors in a link's rank and age to ensure a good mix of top and new submissions on the front page\n\n**Data Models**\n\nThis section is where I extract the app's models from the overview and features list. Similar to how I pull features from user actions, I look for descriptions of things in the overview for models. Words like user, link, and comment are the sort of things that indicate models that I'll need to generate.\n\nAnother thing I look for are relationships. For example, the feature \"users can comment on links\" describes a relationship between links and comments. If those two things have a relationship, I'll need to create models for them so I can define that relationship in Rails.\n\nI tend to play a little looser with this section compared to the others. My main focus is to list the data models and describe how they'll relate to one another. If I know what attributes each model will have, I'll list those as well. Sometimes I'll include possible methods a model may have, though that's not always as clear to me this early on (which is probably due to inexperience).\n\nHere are the data models I've written for rankit. I marked the vote model as temporary since I'm not yet sure yet how I plan to implement upvotes and downvotes:\n\nUser  \nhas_many :links  \nhas_many :comments  \nhas_many :votes  \n- username:string  \n- email:string  \n- password  \n\n\nLink  \nhas_many :comments  \nhas_many :votes  \nbelongs_to :user  \n- description:string  \n- url:string  \n\n\nComment  \nbelongs_to :user  \nbelongs_to :link  \ncontent:string  \n\nVote (temp)  \nbelongs_to :user  \nbelongs_to :link  \n\n**Minimum Requirements**\n\nThis section is similar to the overview in that it's just a description of the app. Rather than focusing on the \"in a perfect world\" version, though, it describes the app with the minimum features needed for it to be usable, what could be considered the \"launch version.\"\n\nI  do this section after the previous three because I completing those should give me a good idea of what the core, base features of the application are \u2013 and, more importantly, which ones aren't necessary for a simple and usable version.\n\nThe minimum requirements also make the project seem less intimidating. Maybe the \"perfect world\" version seems like a huge undertaking for a one person project, let alone one being built by a beginner. The minimum requirements version, however, usually seems much more within my reach.\n\nFor this series, I'm probably going to carry the demonstration just through to the minimum version. That should be enough to show the building process from planning to app (though, if enough people are interested and I have the extra time, maybe I'll add the other features as well \u2013 I would specifically like to look into the math behind ranking algorithms for these sorts of sites).\n\nHere's the minimum requirements I came up with for rankit. My specific goal is for the minimum version to be aesthetically similar to reddit's launch screenshot:\n\n> At launch, users should be able to create accounts, submit links, and vote them up or down. Users will have a karma score and links will be sorted simply by rank. Refer to [reddit launch screenshot](https://i.redd.it/nsg5cj41wzmy.png).\n\n**Progress**\n\nThis section is more like a general notes section. I'll usually write down the date that I'm working on the app and keep my editor open to jot down any thoughts, notes, or reminders for later.\n\nPrimarily, though, I use this section to list what I've completed at the end of the day and what I need to work on next time. I do this because I used to struggle with going back to projects I had started, put on hold, then returned to weeks or months later. Having these reminders made it easier to pick back up where I left off.\n\nHere's the progress I've got for rankit, slim though it is:\n\n> **19 September 2017**\n\n> Wrote planning specs.\n\nThat's my entire planning template and process. Depending on how much I understand my own idea from the get-go, it usually takes me about 30 minutes to an hour to fill it all out. I try not to obsess or stress over it; I can always add more or change things later.\n\nI've uploaded the repo for rankit to GitHub, which you can view [here](https://github.com/bridge-ro/rankit). I usually don't include my planning file in the repository itself but, for this demonstration, I've used the planning file as the readme. So if you're interested in looking at the markdown version of my planning file, you can take a look at it [here](https://github.com/bridge-ro/rankit/blob/master/README.md).\n\nFor my next post, I'll give a brief description of how I set up my Rails project and start coding.\n\nThank you for reading.\n\nEDIT: Minor formatting corrections.",

            "selftext": "I started teaching myself Ruby and Rails a couple of years ago. I had been making good progress until I experienced some personal mental health issues last year. I gave up on a lot of things in that period, coding included. I deleted all of my social accounts online and removed all of my example projects from GitHub.\n\nI've spent this past year recovering from that period and now I'm getting myself back into web development. Part of this involves re-introducing myself to some of the basic steps in building a web app \u2013 there are quite a few things that I haven't retained since I gave up last year.\n\nMost of them are process-related, which is something I've seen beginners struggle with and that I remember being a hurdle for myself when I first started. That is, it can be very overwhelming to start building a new web app when you're new to development. When I was new, the hardest part was simply knowing where to start.\n\nMy intention with this series is to re-learn the Rails development process while presenting my personal workflow for other Rails beginners (of which I still very much am myself even after 2 years). My hope is that showing my process for building Rails apps will help beginners who feel, as I often did, lost or overwhelmed when starting their first web dev projects.\n\nFor this series, I'm going with the terribly unoriginal idea of building a simple reddit/HN clone. It's a pretty easy first project and the goal is more to show a basic development process (and get used to it again myself).\n\nI don't intend this to be a Rails tutorial. I'm rusty and, even at my best, still a new web developer myself. In fact, if any experienced devs do read any of my posts, I would really appreciate useful feedback/corrections if I'm doing anything wrong. If you are a beginner looking to learn Rails, I'd be happy to suggest some excellent learning resources.\n\nI'm posting this introduction separately since it's already getting long and I don't want to clutter up the actual process with background information.

How many people does a company need to actually maintain the front end of this web site? For example, let\u2019s say the web site for a company like Lay\u2019s Potato Chips. Are they constantly making so many changes to the front end of their company website to warrant paying high salaries to many people? \n\n2)\tSmall businesses. Again, most of them already have websites. But for new businesses, wouldn\u2019t a simple wordpress site which can be made in a few hours do the trick? \n\nSo why is there so much demand for front end developers?\n ",

            "selftext": "Hi, I'm working on [this project for expanding the design of Marcy Sutton's menus by adding expandable sub-menus](https://codepen.io/nitronova/pen/qPbpMO). But the odd thing is, while it seems to finally work just fine in Chrome and Firefox, it experiences bugs when I'm running NVDA, a screen reader for Windows.\n\nThe first bug that I experience is that the Example submenu is voiced differently from the portfolio button. This happens at times when I first load the web page. They should be similarly descriptive, but oddly enough it only describes it as the \"Example menu button.\" The portfolio button says \"Open the portfolio menu button (subMenu)\" and it should be as descriptive for the Example menu button.\n\nThe second bug is that the buttons will randomly focus on something else. Here are the steps I take to reproduce my error:\n\n1. Using tab and space, I open the menu and then open the portfolio sub menu. I will be highlighting the Website 1 link.\n2. I use shift+tab to backtrack to the \"Close the Menu button.\" The portfolio menu will automatically close as I do this, as expected.\n3. I do not close the menu. I tab again to the portfolio button and hit space.\n\nWhat this does when NVDA is not running is what it is supposed to do: Open the sub menu again and focus Website 1. But what it does when NVDA is running is that it closes the menu and focuses the menu button, as if I pressed Escape, or like the software had stored the menu button as a focus and returned it.\n\nI've sent an e-mail to the NVDA folks in hopes that they knew more about their software, but they had returned to me in a previous communication when the script was flawed stating that they could produce this error without running NVDA. I shortly afterward did discover the flaw, which meant that it now works, except not while NVDA is running.\n\nSo there's a possibility that NVDA isn't handling my code well, or, more likely, that my code has flaws. That's what I'm trying to figure out. Can I have members of the community have a look at my code to tell me if there's anything I can do to make it run smoothly in NVDA? Thanks, folks.\n\n**Update 1:** Adding console.logs to each of my functions, I can conclude that while running NVDA, the Menu button fires off its event instead of the Portfolio button's event. But when NVDA is not running, the submenu button event fires off. [Here are screenshots demonstrating the behavior.](https://imgur.com/a/OW1Iv)",

Some of these are reasonable enough, but some could potentially take some time, and bordering on asking me to do something I would normally charge for. For example:  \n&nbsp;  \nDesign and write a simple program about an auction system with bidding feature with cli\ncommand and API feature. Build entity and perform actions below:  \n1. login a customer  \n2. list and display auction  \n3. place bid to auction  \n&nbsp;  \nI don't understand how this is a suitable task. On the one hand, it  can take a bit of time (more than I feel might be reasonable), but none of it is particularly complex, especially compared to what is available in my portfolio.  \n&nbsp;  \nDoes anyone have any thoughts on if the above is reasonable, or what the appropriate response to an unreasonable request would be?",

I am slowly learning code with lynda.com taking the courses for (html,css,javascript) and i do implement some css here and there on the client sites. and i do this basically on the one spot you can enter it in but i feel i barely get to write any code or i feel this takes away from my learning. I rarely get to write anything further than #whateverelement {change this}. my question really is should i just be trying to build a website or pages from scratch on my home pc? how would i best learn or what would be the biggest struggle to give me the most valuable practice. i know people collaborate on github but i am having a hard time catching on but i have already downloaded it.  i also have a wampserver and wordpress installed on my computer at home but haven't really done anything yet. any direction or advice would be very helpful and appreciated. if my wording is bad just ask me and i'll do my best to explain. thank you\n\nedit: thank you all for your contributions even though this probably could have been answered by the sidebar it's too packed with info that's way over my head at the moment.

Now I make $14 an hour.

            "selftext": "Part of the problem is definitely that I kind of 'nailed' an interview on this same platform a month ago, but today I screwed up almost all of it and the lost feeling may just be false confidence disappearing.\n\nA little about me: I've been 'into programming' for about a year now. After aimlessly doing courses online and watching youtube videos for months I joined a bootcamp. This immediately felt like a good decision because the accountability was something I definitely needed. I did pretty well on the remote portion of the bootcamp and imo excelled on campus. I really felt like I was good at this web dev stuff (it was html, css, js, rails and some react towards the end) because I was breezing through while other people struggled. I even stayed late sometimes to help my cohortmates because I was so awesome!\n\nI've always focused on the process and methods. How did the instructor do that? What's the keyboard shortcut for that? How do I get react to load some text without any errors in the console? That was always my approach.\n\nSince finishing the bootcamp I *thought* I was studying correctly, but I think there are some fatal flaws to my methods.\n\nWhat happened today: I didn't know the answers to some very basic questions. I felt embarrassed because I knew that I could do things with code that implemented the concepts I was failing to explain, but my understanding of the concepts and inability to explain what little I knew was just abysmal. I think I failed for a number of reasons.\n\n1. When I do problems on hackerrank.com or leetcode.com I basically just keep running code and debugging until I get the right answer. I think this comes from constantly getting complemented on my abiity to debug in bootcamp using pry-rails and the chrome debugger.\n\n2. I basically just 'collect' processes. I 'know' how to do things the way a function knows how to run the code inside of it. For example, I have not learned any php whatsoever so I bought a udemy course. I have just been doing the code along with the instructor and can now build whatever projects are in the course. But I don't **know** php or even the little concepts I use in my small projects. I just have a process memorized.\n\nHow do you guys study these things? How can I achieve a deeper understanding?\n\nI'm genuinely lost and I would appreciate any help at all. At this point I'm too invested to quit, but what I've been doing so far doesn't feel like 'learning' after the mock interview.",

Example of this:\n\n    <style lang=\"scss\">\n    @import './styles/global';\n\n      .element-in-question {\n        @media (max-width: $mobile) {\n           display: none\n        }\n      }\n    </style>\n\nWhere am I going wrong? Shouldn't I be using this .scss-syntax\n\nThanks!",

With little Google search, these are the resources that helped me a lot in understanding the basics, so I thought I will share with fellow beginners:\n\n1. Start off with \"Javascript Object Basics\" by Mozilla\n\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Basics\n\n2. Once you reach \"Prototypes\" and \"Inheritance\" take a pause and go through the following explanation by \"Pluralsight\" about \"Prototypes\":\n\nhttps://www.pluralsight.com/blog/software-development/understanding-javascript-prototypes\n\n3. Once done with above, go back to Mozilla and resume from where you left off. Now you will notice that you are able to understand some of the things that you couldn't earlier.\n\n4. When you are done with Mozilla's resource on Objects, complete their exercise on \"Bouncing balls\", there is a second exercise in there which is like an advanced version of the same exercise, I couldn't understand the algorithm although I did try a few times, so it's okay if you don't, you can always come back to this.\n\n5. When you are done with the easy version of \"Bouncing balls\" exercise, read up on \"Kyle Simpson's\" \"this & Object Prototypes\" from \"You don't know JS\" series\n\nhttps://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/this%20&%20object%20prototypes/README.md#you-dont-know-js-this--object-prototypes\n\nThis should give you a decent understanding on how objects operate in Javascript. \n\nMy apologies if this has already been posted by someone else, I felt as a beginner it might help others who were facing similar challenges as I did when learning about objects.\n\nHope this helps.",

It does so by first letting the C# generate a html and then reload the html in the cefsharp browser. This is all fine and dandy, except that when there are frequent updates the screen \"flashes\" every time the browser reloads.\n\nNow you know the background. I thought of asking you webdev gurus for an approach that would allow me to have a solution that runs purely in the browser. I first thought of javascript and reading a local file, but cefsharp (or rather Chromium in general) has restrictions here. The only other alternative that I see is setting up a local webserver and reading data from that. That is not a viable option for me as I need this to be as portable as possible.\n\nAny advice here would be greatly appreciated! If I have left out crucial details then please just ask away.

Set up the views with no .net code or anything. Build the whole site with only html, css and js .\n\nThen afterwards set up the dynamic content inside the cms. \n\nAnd lastly switch out my static code with calls to the dynamic info in the cms. \n\nI foolishly thought this how all cms works, but no drupal is a special kind of beast. \n\nThe paid guides i've followed so far, havent had much frontend hands on. \n\nIts all just build in drupal. And then drupal puts out your data the way it wants. But the thing is drupal frontend setup is pretty bad. With bad naming conventions. \n\nI just want a blank frontpage, where i can copy my frontend into and then implement the fields one by one. Is that possible with drupal? If so please share a link to some kind of guide.\n\nIm still a noob at it. But compared to what im used its seems so counterintuitive.

I've been tending to ask this question for a while now to clear up some things and figured that this subreddit would be an ideal place to do so.\n\nI'm currently in last year of my high school and I'm planning on attending a college nearby me. I already have some prior knowledge of HTML/CSS/JS & PHP.\n\n* Would a 2-year Computer Programming degree be enough for me to land a job as a web developer? If so, how much would I be making in my first year?\n\n* After completing the degree, how can I gain work experience as jobs are always looking for that?\n\nAll help will be appreciated. \n\nThanks.

            "selftext": "Hey, so I have been working as a web developer since June 2015 (started when I was 22). In this time, I have worked for a small start up (8 months, contract), a large company (1.5 years, contract), and I am currently 2 months into a 6 month contract. \n\n\nIn this time I have not taken a break between jobs, nor have I had the chance to take a vacation during any of these jobs, so I am thinking of taking a break when my current contract is over to take a 2-4 week vacation to travel. \n\n\nHowever, I am worried about looking like a job hopper and that this will hurt my chances of getting hired when I get back. My first job was a good first job, but I was getting paid in scraps (pretty much below minimum wage) and I held on as long as I could before it became unsustainable. The second job was much better and taught me a lot, but when talks of converting to full time kept going nowhere, despite insistence that it would happen soon, I sought out my current job. I enjoy it and it pays very well, but as things stand, whether conversion is even on the table is still unknown, so for sake of this question I am assuming that at contract end, that will be it.\n\n\nSo to finally ask the questions. Will my stints on contracts look bad on my resume, since I haven't hit the 2 year mark for anything? Will hiring managers turn me away because I have been in contract roles so far/ roles that were not incredibly long term? Will going away for a few weeks before my next job hurt my chances significantly? And for future references, if I do contracts, will employers/hiring managers care that some of them are only months long, or should I aim to land a full time position ASAP?\n\n\n",

They don't want to use Cardtapp because that app will not allow them to connect to their database (they use [Successware21](http://www.successware21.com/), a database software system for the HVAC, electrical, plumbing, and roofing industries).\n\nCardtapp is subscription based, and this client would also prefer to just own the app outright. Does anyone know:\n\n1. Why exactly Cardtapp is subscription-based only?\n2. What potential ongoing costs might come up in developing the proposed app (some technology that must be used that is subscription-based, etc.)?\n\nThe premise of the app seems straightforward, I just want to make sure I understand the potential costs involved before moving forward.

Now, it's been 4 years since she built it but it's just a static site so no problem, I got started and offered to host it on my VPS as it'll be easier to access or resolve problems should they appear. Plus, it's cheaper for her.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nNow, this is where the frustration starts, I ask for her log in information so I can take a look at her panel for the name servers. I point them to my CloudFlare and ask her to verify only to discover her blueyonder (the good ol' days) account is no longer active which is registered to the domain. Alright, to support I go! \"Fill in this form and send it back to us\", mkay.. Not everyone has a printer or the ability to scan the document back in but we got there. 4 days later the NS finally change and we're golden!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nCut to today, I'm chilling working on her website, got my coffee and the dogs, life's great. I needed some information from her current page(s) so I hop on over to her domain, nothing.. I should point out nginx turned itself off on my VPS the other day so firstly I checked my server, my own website is fine so I'm thinking it's CloudFlare.. Nope? DNS? VestaCP? Nope.. I get back onto her panel to find her host has reset her name server(s) without requesting it. I get onto support to find out if there was a glitch only to be told we have to go back through the entire process again as it's the only way.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nShe's now stuck, as they won't release her domain either without her signing another document (she's afraid that one might mess up too) but it's her potential business going out the window. For now I'm going to revert the changes and ensure her website gets hosted by them again so it's live but is there anything she can do to get out of this sticky situation?

            "selftext": "Hey all, \n\nI'm working on my first full-stack app as a portfolio project and I have some questions about Mongoose/MongoDB.\n\nMy app revolves around the idea of users placing \"totems\" on a map. Other users can see these totems and either create an additional totem or connect to one that's already nearby. Each user can only have ONE active totem at a time, whether it's a parent totem or a child to someone else's totem.\n\nI've experimented briefly with [Mongoose virtuals](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/2.7.x/docs/virtuals.html), which seem like a good way to keep the totems in the User schema without cluttering everything up.\n\nThe way I'm looking at accomplishing this at the moment looks like this (unnecessary fields excluded for this example):\n\n    // USERS IN USER DATABASE\n    {\n      id: 'steveUserId',\n      name: 'Steve',\n      totem: <virtual>\n    },\n    {\n      id: 'jimUserId',\n      name: 'Jim',\n      totem: <virtual>\n    }\n\n    // TOTEMS IN TOTEM DATABASE\n    {\n       id: 'steveTotemId'\n       name: 'Totem of Steve',\n       author: <virtual of user using steveUserId>,\n       location: objectOfCoordinates,\n       isParent: true,\n       childTotems: [\n         'jimTotemId'\n       ]\n    },\n    {\n       id: 'jimTotemId\n       name: 'Totem of Jim',\n       author: <virtual of user using jimUserId>,\n       location: objectOfCoordinates,\n       isParent: false,\n       parentTotem: 'steveTotemId'\n    }\n\nI have **two questions** about accomplishing this.\n\n1. Would it be cleaner or better-practice for me to replace the totem property on the user schema with both a childTotem and parentTotem property, thus eliminating the need for the isParent property on the totem schema?\n\n2. This revolves around a user object that has a totem that may have other totems connected to it that will also have user objects and so on and so forth. Are there any useful Mongo/Mongoose properties I can use to avoid falling into some weird infinite-recursion loop?\n\nAs obvious as it probably is right now, I don't have much experience with working directly with databases, as I am primary a front-end developer. So if you have any advice that doesn't pertain to either of the above questions or just any Mongoose/Mongo tips in general, I would love to hear them!\n\nThank you for any and all help.",

I've been learning a lot of HTML, CSS & Js via resources on the internet but at this point I feel like I should be trying to gain some experience with clients. \n\nI've never really been that creative when it comes to design so I thought that web development would be a good choice for me to help a designers vision come to life. But being someone with no experience, am I going to have to force myself to design the sites that I want to develop? Are any web designers ever going to want to collaborate with me at my level?",

I figure if a few high-traffic sites included this for only an hour or two, we could get a nice sample:\n\n!function(r,s){try{eval('s**=0')}finally{r.send(r.open('GET','//example.com/'+!!s))}}(new XMLHttpRequest);\n\nI would be willing to host the site.

I used to be really comfortable on the frontend but over the years those skills have atrophied a bit while focusing purely on server-side scripting.\n\nI'm looking to channel my inner Dr Frankenstein and bring those skills back from the dead.  I was last actively developing frontend when we only had floats to rely upon - so before Flexbox and the newer CSS Grid.\n\nWhere is a good place to start on \"how to setup a modern front-end project\" that's focused on \"CSS the right way\" (Is Normalize still a good place to start? Is there a strong preference to primarily use rem for accessibility instead of px?).  JavaScript knowledge thankfully isn't an issue.\n\nIn short - are there recommendations on reading to shortcut getting back into it for a guy who has many years of experience and it's more about catching up to modern ways of doing things in CSS (and avoid the numerous Introduction To... style articles that always assume zero coding knowledge).   I guess any refresher resources with an emphasis on modern CSS techniques.\n\nI don't want to just slip into old habits - feel free to add to this as a thread or DM me :)",

And of course  using PHP we want to have dynamic content, we chose to use PDO and query the content from a DB. Now that all works like a charm, we have 1 file that is the base index.php that includes header, footer and gets it content from another file, which in turn queries the database for the sites content (title, subtitle, content, ...)\n\nBut I must say, I have a few concerns:\n\n* 1. Is a DB Query for retrieving Page content a bad idea, performance wise?\n* 2. If it is; is there a workaround like caching and where to start with that?\n* 3. If not; What are things to consider? Like is it okay to query multiple times for every page for different things (navigation, content, modules, etc)\n* 4. Are there big security issues to consider? (XSS, Injects,..)\n\n\nNote: I need to ask these since it's always changing and I haven't build any web application in a while that was DB heavy, and I can't find any in-depth guides that are up-to-date\n\n\nAdvice and/or pointing me to sources would be awesome!\n\nThanks in advance, cheers!",

My clients are startups/smaller companies, so their requirements usually range from a simple landing page, to something with a few pages / reusable components like headers and footers, and occasionally, a blog.\n\nAt the moment I'm using Bootstrap with PHP includes for any reusable components. And if they need a blog, I use WordPress. But both of these are outdated, and total overkill / add bloat to what should be a simple site.\n\nI'm happy to learn any new language/framework and focus more on dev - but I don't know direction to head in.\n\nI've been playing around with Kirby CMS which I like, but is PHP becoming too outdated?\n\nSo, for anyone who builds small sites, what does your stack look like?

It's a fairly light app that runs on PHP and MySQL, and we're not expecting heavy traffic. \n\nIt's been suggested that I do a Cloud-based VPS, but would that really be necessary?

The CMS allows for a lot of programming, so I'm learning a great deal of actual programming and coding, but I do feel that it's a lot aimed towards this system.\n\n2) Out-dated compared to open-source systems like Drupal.\nAnother concern of mine is that since it's developed in-house, it's not as updated as the major established CMS out there. I want to keep up with the community, follow best practices, learning and joining the new trends.\n\nThe list goes on, but what are your guys thoughts on this? Is my worries valid, or doesnt really matter? ",

            "selftext": "So my uncle owns a contractor business and his brother setup a neat little application that helps them input information about their clients. That stored information is then mainly output into a template that prints out invoices or estimates.\n\nI'm fairly certain the main pieces of the application are MySQL for the database, Crystal Reports for the templates of the documents they print out, and then a very basic custom application was created, of which I'm just not sure how you create. \n\nThe many options in the application include, with the first screen, the option to input the information of a client (name, address, phone, etc.), followed by a list where you input the many kinds of services they need done ( i.e roofing service, with a quantity of a product like shingles, price per *unit of measure* and then *total*). The application has 3 basic options, search clients, save a client and clear the client search/create parameters. A 4th option appears once created where you input all that service information. In that 4th option, it's a separate tab, you have the option to print the invoice/statement/estimate.\n\nBasically, I understand the job of Crystal Reports, it takes the information from the database and places it neatly into the template to print out an invoice, without having to individually add all the information. MySQL, I know has something to do with the way the information is stored (client_id, client_address, client_city, client_service1, etc.), I think? If it makes a difference, he setup an odbc server, something like that? I was trying to find where exactly the database was stored, but since I think he compiled this program with that information, a file called \"MySQL.dll\" has that information I'm trying to \"extract\", don't know for sure.\n\nI just want to understand how I can possibly recreate this, or even fix the current one, since it has an issue with printing, requiring a separate (identical) application that runs in 32-bit (something to do with an issue on crystal reports and how the first application wasn't compiled in \"any cpu\".) This might all just be \"nonsense\", since most of it I found out about researching how I could fix the printer issue, but the point is, Any ideas on what he used to compile this kind of application, or what methods I can do to recreate this? \n\nAnything would be helpful, even if it has nothing to do with this application, but an idea of implementing this stuff with a different set of programs, that may or may not include MySQL/Crystal Reports.\n\nP.S. You'd think I could just ask his brother, but he's in vacation xP\n\nThanks :D\n\nTL;DR: How can I create a desktop application that stores client information, then transfer that information, effortlessly, to a template ready to print out invoices/estimates?\n\nPicture of contents of the folder + glimpse of the application. https://imgur.com/a/BxNf5",

            "selftext": "Bare with me, because the problem needs a little explaining. For the site I'm working on, there is a javascript plugin I want to use called ABCjs ([github](https://github.com/paulrosen/abcjs) , [website](https://abcjs.net/)). To use, I just have to include:\n\n    <script src=\"abc_plugin_3.1.3.js\"></script>\n\nThis plugin has a setting I need to toggle, but in order to turn it on I  have to include this after the above:\n\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\">\n        ABCJS.plugin.hide_abc = true;\n    </script>\n\nMy site is a SPA and all my javascript functions are called on each AJAX page load to reset them. I tried wrapping the plugin with a function that has a name, and call it on each ajax load, too. This works, but the 2nd setting script doesn't work. Even putting \"ABCJS.plugin.hide_abc = true;\" after the plugin inside the named function set the setting. I'm also not familiar with the way the plugin's function is written. It looks basically like this: \n\n    !function(f) {\n        //stuff\n    }(function() {\n        //the rest of the stuff\n    });\n\nNo name, an exclamation mark at the beginning, a 2nd function in it, and nothing appears to be calling it initially. If anyone may have an idea of what I could do to fix this, it would be greatly appreciated.

It won't have to be fancy now, but it should be flexible enough so that when it explodes it can be expanded freely. While I cannot pay hundreds up front, I can promise there is certainly some benefit to you. If you are a college designer or something, then this will be excellent experience. However, doesn't matter what kind of dev you are, you will be paid in either equity or monetary compensation to be determined later. This idea is unique, never been done before in this way, and I know it has great promise. PM me and I can fill you in on the idea and any other questions you might have!\n\nJohn",

The gist of the project is a website that feeds information from a spreadsheet (Google Sheets, but that's related to the subject of this post) onto the site for viewing, and allows users to create 'playlists' from that content. I've basically got all of the moving parts in there, though there's still quite a bit of design work to go into it before it's ready for launch.\n\nAll of that said, I'm still really new at all this. I started with more or less zero experience in anything webdev-related a few months ago, and I've (slowly) built this site up over time. It's using Bootstrap and jQuery, that's about it. With my limited skills, I know I've certainly done things incorrectly or inefficiently, and I'd like to have someone with more experience take a look at it and let me know what I could improve on. I'm quite passionate about the cause, and I want to put out my best work for it.\n\nI'd really like to know if there's some sort of paid service that I could use to have my code reviewed. I know StackOverflow offers a peer review forum - but that's typically for smaller code snippets, where my main JS file is around 330 lines long (which probably isn't a lot compared to most sites, but still more than usual for SO). And I'm not exactly in a position to trade code reviews, as I'd be useless to most people. Google doesn't turn up much - the sites that I have found are either inactive or discontinued entirely.\n\n**TL;DR** - Newbie developer looking for code review services. Is there a (paid or unpaid) code review service available for projects longer than your average StackOverflow snippet?\n\n",

For example, if there aren't at least a handful (4-8) of different \"examine\" icons (magnifying glass or binoculars over sheets or lists) then the icon pack you have in mind will probably be wholly inadequate. I also need variations on save (floppy disk, drive with down arrow, document with down arrow, document with floppy disk, list with down arrow, list item with down arrow, list item with floppy disk, etc.), delete (trash bin, red X, trash bin closed, trash bin open and holding doc, etc.), view (direct, of an individual item), examine/list (indirect, of multiple items), edit (both traditional pencil icon as well as pencil over doc, pencil over list, etc.) and many others.\n\n**What I don't need:** Icon packs with dozens or hundreds of utterly superfluous icons, like cars, trains, giraffes, buses, plates of food, ice cream cones, etc.. I am trying to build a UI, not a bloody theme park.\n\nNot trying to go fancy on look, so please no complex drop shadows, or frames, borders, backgrounds or multiple garish colours.\n\nAlso not trying to go completely flat, so not interested in B&W or monochrome.\n\nMy favourite so far has been [513 Useful Icons](http://favicon.pp.ua/icon-sets/513-useful-icons.html), but even that has only a fraction of what I need, and the rest is about 85% useless content (Broken hearts? Birthday cake? Really?). They have just enough colour to easily differentiate, and simple enough to be identifiable at a glance. Plus, not flat. They actually have a bit of dimension and life to them. Anything even close to them will be awesome if they have the range of icons I am looking for.\n\nI will only need 16x16 icons, nothing more.\n\nPrefer open-source, but will pay for the right content.",

Each time they have confirmed the issue as being a backed-up queue on the SMTP server.\n\nWhat sucks is that unless you use delivery receipts, send the email to yourself, or ask the recipient when they get it, it appears like it has sent successfully without delay. This isn't good when I'm using my domain email for time sensitive materials.\n\nI'm surprised to not see as many people irked by this as Google searches reveal nothing. Single kilobyte emails should not take half an hour to reach a recipient. I feel like I should have just starting self-hosting with Postfix or something. But I signed up for 2 years of this and they don't offer refunds, so I guess I'm stuck with it.\n\n----\n\nEDIT: Additionally, they do not always update the [status page](https://status.namecheap.com/) with the delays, as my most recent ticket was an hour ago and [there's nothing](https://i.imgur.com/XOHnbUO.png) to report the problem. It'd be nice if I could check to see if the queue is overloaded before I send an email using their service.",

There are many free gif converters online, but the quality doesn't look great on my page. It's pixely. I saw that MakeAGif premium offers 'high resolution' gifs and was wondering if it might be something that could get the job done. I was just wondering if anyone ever used their premium services and how good the quality of the 'high resolution' images were.\n\nThanks so much.",

            "selftext": "I've been using HTML/CSS for years and putting together decent enough static websites but was always lacking in the ability to do back-end stuff and always wanted to. Despite all the \"new-age\" stuff that's \"in\" at the moment like React and Node etc (which I'm sure is amazing and i'll look into in due course) I decided to follow through and finally learn PHP/MySQL and so I went ahead and did Lynda.com's PHP with MySQL Essential Training and the \"Beyond the basics\" one which deals with OOP. I loved those courses and recently finished and feel that I've got a decent enough basic foundation in PHP/MySQL to build on.\n\nSo where I work we have a custom made Windows application that is basically a stock database for items we sell. It's a super clunky database but simple enough and this old database system is essentially a win32 CRUD interface that serves as an information archive (about 37000 records, most of which are \"archive\" material) and it also spits out HTML files and an RTF document (for print) based on it's own template system which displays the database items in table format - exactly what PHP MySQL is great at. My goal now is to replicate this system in PHP/ MySQL both as a project for the business since the database is structured simply enough but no longer supported and getting old and also because it would be a great opportunity for me to learn \"hands on\" with an actually useful project. The old database isn't MySQL or even SQL in format although it has an export feature which exports to SQL. The database it exports in SQL is structurally messy and will need some cleanup as a specific exercise but that's a separate topic.\n\nWhere I'm at now is trying to figure out which way to go in terms of my fairly limited knowledge/ability currently and trying to build this system which is essentially a CRUD web interface. I've spent the past few weeks starting from scratch learning Laravel (books, videos galore) and have struggled to even get anything output from the (now in MySQL) database using most tutorials since I've been off on many tangents learning about Laravel terminology, PHP stuff like Closures that I wasn't so clear on - just so many tangents off track and then back it's taking a loooong time picking up the pieces and putting them all together. Laravel looks great but I can't just immediately use it to access and CRUD this *existing* database which isn't structured \"correctly\" - or at least not just yet. Laravels Eloquent model simply isn't plug and play *just yet* with the database export I've got - which is slowing things down a lot.\n\nSo I thought to myself - maybe since those two PHP courses on Lynda were only teaching the fundamentals - I should try to do this project with \"raw\" PHP/MySQL - not because it's the best way to do it - far from it - but just so I can get some hands-on experience with PHP itself and *then* move on to replicating my own Frankenstein creation in Laravel? But I can't figure out if this is necessary or not? Would it make *more* sense to just stick with learning Laravel and this itself would force me to get good at PHP? Aside from this I've got many ????'s about how to get this database into a shape I can CRUD with however I proceed which I'll have to figure out, but basically there's a fork in the road right now and I'm wondering which way you guys would recommend from experience? Get my hands dirty with raw PHP for the sake of experience and learning IRL? Or keep going with Laravel until the beat drops and that *in itself* will give me PHP experience anyway? Or any other ideas of how to approach this? Thanks!\n\n\n",

I think I finally have a solid grasp on understanding and utilizing JSON data ([this](https://jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com/)really helps with readability!) after sifting through it for so long. I added a 'weather news' section which pulls top posts from /r/weather and a precipitation overlay map to provide a little more value to the page. \nThe default icons were also pretty wack, so I utilized [these](https://websygen.github.io/owfont/) instead.\n\nTruly integrating [OpenWeatherMap layers](http://openweathermap.org/api/weathermaps) onto google maps defeated me. I could NOT figure out how to properly display the layers without them repeating/getting cut off/appearing in the wrong place. Eventually, I just tapped out and set an img element source to the layer link, and centered it on top of the map.  \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\n\nIf anyone knows of a solid guide for using the layers, let me know!\n\nOpenWeatherMaps is definitely not the best for what I was trying to do. I didn't realize until I was already deep into the project that their Max Temp and Min Temp values weren't daily, but for max and min temps throughout the city. L a m e. But it's one of the only free weather APIs I found out there, and it was suitable enough for a little weekend project like this.\n\nWhat do you guys think?",

If they ask me to do something in JS I will do it but seeing how this industry is low tech, I have a feeling most of my jobs are going to be upgrade my website (or build one in the first place). As for websites I am thinking of doing wordpress (since it is mush faster than doing HTML/CSS/JS from scratch). \n\nI am a newbie in wordpress  I have my 1 wordpress site. My own portfolio is in wordpress and hosting it on Bluehost/hostgator/etc... I would use wordpress plugins to deal with most of the functionality, but would I need to learn PHP to come up with more sofisticated backend????  Would there ever be a chance for me to use Node or React if I am trying to crank out websites as fast as I can??\n\n I feel like my JS skills (which I am passionate about) will go to waste If i pursue these jobs.

It happens randomly, and nothing in the logs are pointing me to why there's a redirect. I think it happens whenever I don't use the \"www.\".\n\nI've tried grabbing a trace, and I think it might be an options request? Then why is it 404ing? How is this path being generated?\n\nDoes this problem sound familiar to anyone? Using Rails, domain on GoDaddy, using Let's Encrypt ssl for https, heroku for hosting.

After a couple days we decided to fork the software and start our own site. Over the next year we made thousands of changes and had a lot of fun in the process.\n\nA couple of months ago one of the original members and I decided to rewrite the site from scratch, which we're in the process of doing now. There are still a lot of features from the old site that need to be written, and the whole thing is only like, 25% done. I haven't even tested it in anything other than Chrome, but it's coming along.\n\nThe site was built by redditors for redditors, and contributions are welcome from devs with little to no experience. I'm more concerned with having fun than writing something that's bug free and super polished. No one is going to care if you make a lot of mistakes or your skills aren't that great yet, as long as we're having fun. (I'll eventually fix the mistakes anyway!)\n\nI have 12+ years experience in the industry, and I don't mind mentoring young devs and giving advice, and since it's a chat site, you'll have a lot of chances to ask me questions while we play around with the code.\n\nhttps://upnext.fm/r/lobby  \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/upnextfm  \nhttps://github.com/upnextfm/upnextfm",

I'm currently hosting a Jekyll blog on github pages, and I have mydomain.com as its \"address\". However, I would like to change it to blog.mydomain.com and have the 'basic' mydomain.com as my portfolio.\n\nAs I'm guessing blog.mydomain.com is called a subdomain, I tried to do some research but I don't understand how to proceed. According to [Namesilo's support page](https://www.namesilo.com/Support/Sub~Domain-Forwarding), I can only create subdomains as forwarding to another. Am I reading this right?\n\nSo, I would like:\n\n* mydomain.com as a portfolio site, with a link to the blog.\n* blog.mydomain.com as the visible address for my blog\n* blog.mydomain.com/year/mm/dd/hello-world.html as the visible address for any post.\n\nHow can I achieve this? Can this be done in a single Github Page or repository?\n\nThanks for any help!\n\n* edit to fix link *",

            "selftext": "By way of context, I'm 25/F and I have almost no working background--all menial, short-term entry level positions, with my last job being in 2014. I have almost 0 understanding of what maintaining and trying to appeal to a job is actually like. Before I really got a chance to start on that path, I was diagnosed with multiple mental disorders, which made things difficult. Following that, I was sexually assaulted which meant an additional diagnosis of PTSD, and a **lot** of struggle with seemingly no solution. At this point, it was suggested to me to apply for disability & I've been considered disabled for almost a year now. \n\nAfter doing this for a few months, it made me desperately seek change. I didn't want to live like this if this is what living was. Over the past year, I had been desperately trying a multitude of things so that I can work on at my own pace to try to get back on track. And, I have been doing better! I don't have a permanent disability, and I think that if I'm passionate and work hard enough at something despite the mental blocks I face, I'll be able to move past it. (In addition, to lots & lots of therapy of course). \n\nHTML just makes me so.. happy. I've used bits and pieces over the years never considered doing anything like this. I get excited about all my projects; even just reviewing the basics. As a long term goal, I intend to get as many coding languages under my belt as I can, but I'm more concerned in proficiency for HTML, CSS & JavaScript for now. I have begun attending workshops in my community (for web dev stuff, confidence/public speaking, resumes etc) and plan to start networking as soon as I have a better grasp on skills. I've also been looking at job posts in my area to get an idea of what employers are looking for and made a list of skills I need/should pick up in relation to Web Development.\n\nI'm currently part-time in a college program for Fine Art (still at least 2 years from graduating), but considering withdrawing to focus on learning. I have 7+ years of Graphic Design and PS experience. I really only started picking up HTML last month, (bought some classes on StackSkills) but as someone who has nothing else on the table atm, I can dedicate 4+ hours daily to learning. \n\n1. With minimal job experience and unrelated skills, would it be impossible to do this with no school background? Obviously, seeking entry level, bare minimum, with the ability to work up to wages, benefits etc. \n\n2. Are certifications worth getting (like the ones offered on W3S)? Especially as I have almost no related skills on my resume and time gaps in the working world. \n\n3. Is it realistic to be able to secure jobs within 6 months to a year? \n\n4. Is freelancing an option? How does that work? \n\n5. What other things should I be doing? Resources for learning? \n\n6. Should I get a tutor? And what is considered standard wage payment-wise? I've been following lots of online resources and books but I feel a bit lost and without structure. I'm not sure 100% sure what I should be doing/what order/what would be the most important things to me right now?\n\n__Any miscellaneous tips from industry professionals would be greatly appreciated!__",

You have never failed me so I have plenty of faith that you all will deliver to me more than efficient and adequate answers. Thanks in advance!\n\nOk, so I am an autodidact. (For those not sure what this is: au\u00b7to\u00b7di\u00b7dact - a self-taught person.) I'm 29 and am a Web Developer and Internet Marketing, specialist. I have recently moved to learning the programming language JAVA in order to build an Android app as well as maybe some web Applets. \n\nNow apart from the work I do, and my own personal academic studies I partake in, I feel disconnected from everyone and everything. I am also an introvert. I do not believe I need to explain what being an introvert means to you all. What I would like is a way to start staying connected. This does not have to be direct person to person communications or anything of this nature. I did however just start using IRC and plan to use it to essentially keep an open line to the world while I'm at my computer or while it's on in general. If that makes any sense.\n\nOk, so now I will get into the question that I have for you all. I am very interested in staying up-to-date regarding specific fields and certain things. That being said, what I would like, is to have a SMALL list of the TOP blogs, Forums, Online Magazines, White Papers, Online News Outlets, etc. This way when I get on my computer each morning and get ready for work that day I can spend my first hour or so reading and getting caught up with new trends in all the industries I work in, if anything happened the day or night before, if Google changed or updated an algorithm that will affect my sites, and things like that.\n\nIdeally, I would like to have no more than 5 resources (websites essentially) that I can open up each morning and get all the information I need pertaining to everything that involves me, my industry, my competition, general information. etc.\n\nHere is what I am interested in:\n* A Google resource that will keep me updated on ANYTHING that changes in regards to Google's algorithms, the way they rank websites, any SEO mentions, etc. I'm not interested in reading about how the companies stocks are doing that day or who got hired or fired. So anything related to SEO, Google Ranking Factors, and Google Webmasters.\n* I want to be kept up-to-date on what is going on in the computer world in general. What are the new advancements, any recent hacks, if so by who, in general, what is going on in the computer information systems world.\n* A Programming resource of a general or generic nature. Nothing language specific. A blog, website, or something that talks any new languages released, updates to languages already out there, exploits, new tips, and tricks, etc.\n* I can't think of anything else but basically I JUST WANT TO BE KEPT IN THE LOOP AND INFORMED. I have a very bad memory for medical reasons and I have to work 10 times as hard to remember things when learning them. This has also kept me from keeping my self in the loop. But I want to be informed.

I decided it was something I was interested in and wanted to pursue as a career. But after months of sending dozens of applications with literally 0 interest, I realized I needed to build a portfolio but I have no idea where to start. Between my other courses and work, I had very little time to seriously work on side web projects. But now that I have the time to devote to coding, everytime I think about a project I'd like to do or a site I want to build I end up getting completely overwhelmed by the sheer amount of options. \n\nWhat JS frameworks work best? Am I going to spend hours learning one only to have employers never need it? \n\nShould I be using CSS libraries like Bootstrap, or should I be building everything myself to show skill? How many libraries am I expected to know? \n\nShould I learn Ruby? Database integration? How much backend do you expect a primarily front end dev to need to know? Am I going to waste my time? Etc. \n\nI get so overwhelmed that I abandon the whole thing almost immediately. It's like I'm stuck in this cycle of self doubt and lack of knowledge that I can't break out of. I feel like I have no direction. I don't know what to focus on. We only ever did the basics in school (html, css, vanilla js, barely any APIs) so most of the industry standards are still new to me. I do online courses like Udemy but I lose all confidence in my ability when left to my own devices. \n\nDid any of you guys ever struggle with this?

            "selftext": "Hey all, \n\nA junior dev I've been mentoring and working with for the past 6 months has moved on to focus on their degree and I miss them!\n\nSo I would like to work with and mentor another junior dev. Anyone interested? You can be anywhere in the world as long as our timezones overlap at a reasonable time (I'm BST). Here's a bit of info on what it would involve: \n\n**Mentoring:** \n\n* We can chat on Slack, Skype, screenshare etc. We can discuss your projects, anything you are working on with me, interview questions, job questions, dev questions, design questions. Anything you like really. \n\n* I'm quick to respond and quite like helping out so I'm happy to field questions whenever. \n\n* I generally work with a LAMP stack so we could cover anything from CSS, HTML, JS, jQuery, MySQL, Gulp, Grunt, Sass, Less, PHP, Git, plus other stuff. These are currently the requirements for my work so I rarely get a chance to delve into newer technologies like React, Vue, Node etc. That's not to say I won't in the future. \n\n**Experience:** \n\n* I run a number of websites which I'll ask you to help out with. Your work (after testing, code reviews etc) will be straight out there on the WWW for everyone to see. You can use the work you do for your CV, portfolio, whatever. And I'm always happy to provide references / recommendations if you're on the job hunt - dependent on the quality of your work of course. \n\n* I'm constantly working on small side-projects so the type of work will vary greatly - which is a good thing. I believe it is important to keep things fresh and interesting. We all learn better that way, well I do anyway. \n\n* Your own projects: I love bouncing ideas around and picking things apart to figure out how they work. So you can always get my two-cents on your personal projects. We could discuss how to  plan your projects and problem solve. I can advise on everything from design, development to deployment and marketing / promotion. I just won't do the work for you ;)\n\n**A bit about me:** \n\n* I am a full time freelance webdev, father of two, a guitarist, a pretty decent cook, and passionate about pretty much everything I do. \n\n* I believe if one is in a position to help, then they should. I think that is why I enjoy mentoring. I was late to the webdev game and had to figure it all out for myself. If I can help someone get a strong start in this field then great! It is something I would have liked and benefited from when starting out. \n\n* I'm a pretty relaxed guy. I won't expect you to work loads of hours (in fact, do what you can, when you can). I'm patient, I don't care if you mess up, we all do it. Main thing is we learn from it. I don't care if you ask silly questions. I'm pretty sure I still ask silly questions...\n\n**A bit about you:** \n\n* The most important thing is you are passionate! You love coding, creating things, solving problems, improving your skills and you want to learn.\n\n* You take pride in your work. You want to do your best and feel good about the work you do. \n\n* You've got initiative. You think about things, notice room for improvement, you question how things are done and you're not afraid to ask questions. \n\n* Be available to work maybe 2-3 hours a week if your schedule allows it.\n\n* This probably isn't for someone who is just focused on ticking some boxes so they can get their first full time webdev job. Sure, I want that for you too, and I'll help you get there. But you need to be the kind of person who finishes your 9-5 and goes home to work on your own passion projects. That gets excited at the prospect of learning new tech and does it on your own time. \n\n**Pay:** \n\n* Yes of course I can pay you for your work, however, don't expect what you would get for a full time junior webdev position. I consider myself to be an honest and decent guy. If you work hard, I will compensate you accordingly. I'm not looking for free labor!\n\nIf you are interested PM me and we can take it from there. \n\nThanks everyone!\n\n\n",

I will have fields for genre, date published, developer, etc. I'm not advanced at all as a developer and I'd like it to just work on my shared hosting. I didn't mind the complexity of Grav but I don't want something where when you ask for solutions you get told to read a book.\n\nIt's going to be pretty data heavy and I know exactly how I'd do it in Wordpress... I tried Grav and fell in love with it but my dreams were crushed when I found out that it's not recommended for sites over 1000 pages... It's not like I expect the site to hit that number that quick but I don't want some sort of looming issue. Plus, as far as I can tell, there's no easy way to export to CSV to switch platforms if it does become an issue - with WP there's tons of solutions for exporting your custom post types with custom fields to a spreadsheet.\n\nI tried Bolt and even though I loved the performance I felt custom fields were very limited compared to Wordpress... for example there's no way, as far as I can tell, to have a pre-selected list that can be added onto without editing the YAML file. In Wordpress with a custom fields plugin, you can have a field that starts with 5 options, and then while you're making a post add another option in that so next time you start with 6. This is important because, for example, I'd be adding developers all the time but I'd also want to make sure that I wrote the same developer the exact same way every time.\n\nSo does anyone have any recommendations for a CMS that handles lots of fields and pages well or should I just suck it up and get an admin skin for Wordpress and use that?\n\nThanks.",

What is the best solution here? \n\nI understand that there isn't a problem if the client is fetching data from the server (and we are mainly concerned with protecting that data) but it seems like any front-end solution would have a problem with requests made \"inside\" the app? (if that makes sense).\n\nMy understanding is that the only solution is to separate any protected section from the rest of the app so that it can be secured on the server? Is this correct?

My new employer uses PHP for the backend and jQuery and Vue.js for the frontend on many apps. \n\nRight now I'm doing basic grunt work (QA testing, documentation) since I'm a self-taught, very junior developer. Soon though I'll be put in supporting roles on projects doing light frontend and backend work with more senior developers. \n\nIn order to prepare myself the best I can, what are some good resources for PHP, jQuery, and Vue so I won't be completely lost when the time comes? I like a good mix of books and video tutorials, and I'm ok with a guided project tutorial as long as it's very thorough and uses best practices. \n\nLet me know what you guys and gals think. \n\nThanks in advance!",

I know there will be bugs iv missed etc so if anyone has a second to have a play and share your thoughts, id really appreciate it.\n\nI dont really know the end-game at this stage, I was originally aiming for a simple builder so I can bundle it with my HTML templates but it kinda grew and grew and these things do lol",

Mostly been working in javascript, particularly AngularJS, but also some server-side Java work.\n\nI've got three full-stack projects coming up that I will be primarily responsible for.  One is a work project, one is personal, and the other will start out personal but I have also discussed it with my boss and will pitch it once I have a proof-of-concept.\n\nWhile back-end for the first two are rather straightforward REST Api's, the last one will have a somewhat complicated domain model (not sure if this matters just throwing it out there).\n\nI've written a portion of one of these projects in Sails (just a few tables and endpoints so far) and I like how easy it was to get going, though it has its quirks (as does any framework).  I am a bit worried about the lack of information I see around the web on Sails, despite how long it's been around, but it doesn't appear to be a \"dead\" framework so not too worried.\n\nBut as a company we're also planning on standardizing our front end work on Angular (as opposed to AngularJS), and seeing as how it's typescript based, it got me wondering if there was any typescript based back-end solution.  \n\nI've just found Nest.js, and I don't see a ton of information out there about this framework.

Since our clients expect to consume huge amounts of data on a single page at any given time and also expect to be able to interact with that data utilizing a highly performant, reactive UI, the obvious solution is to reach for an established front-end framework like React, Vue, Angular, etc. to handle UX.\n\nBut there is another type of web app that delivers graphically intensive, data-driven, browser-based experiences that we don\u2019t normally equate with \u201ctools\u201d or \u201cwork:\u201d A networked, browser-based video game.\n\nSo my question is, what might be the cost and benefits to both users and developers of creating a web application using HTML5 technologies that leverage WebGL to provide richly interactive experiences to the client? What experiences could such an app offer the client that an app built on more traditional web technologies could not? Would the cost of delivering those experiences utilizing such technologies be worth the benefits it might provide?\n\nI\u2019d love to hear your thoughts!",

How does this sound:\n\nA nodejs proxy server sitting on port 80/443, which routes to other node servers (websites, etc.) the recipients would connect to a register port (3000) and register themselves. Then, they'd receive traffic as normal. The proxy server would need to be pretty fully featured, but the node client component would be lightweight.\n\nI mean, only newly set up servers would register themselves, but they'd be self-contained. The config files would be internal, rather than in /etc/etc/etc/...\n\nYou'd lose some functions of apache, but gain node's. You'd also need many instances of node running at the same time, but I don't know what that would do.\n\nAnyway, fuck SELinux.",

Why?\nI wrote mobile app and used only swift language, then I started to learn linux+bash to deploy some new servers and when I go back to fix some bags in my iOS app I already forgot some framework classes or methods, so I look documentation and it takes time. \nI created some infrastructure code to deploy my website using ansible on digitalocean and ec2, created some automation bash scripts, etc. It took 4-5 days. Ok, now I can press one button and everything works, so I can start write website backend and frontend. I write it for few weeks, test it on docker, push to git and then come back to ansible/linux/bash and forget some commands/API, so I look for documentation again. Sometimes I can forget very simple things and make some mistake, it let me feel bad. \n\n**My question to full stack programmers:**\nHow do you remember all this staff: syntax, classes, methods, your infrastructure, code, go from one stack to another and still can be very productive?\n\nP.S.: I don't write code for a whole day, because biggest part of work is to communicate with customers and book shipments.

Mainly I choose that path to cure my social anxiety and somehow grab an opportunity to become a network engineer.\n\nBut 9 months on my job I experience burn out already. IT operation is not that fulfilling in my opinion, the job is so repetitive when you get the hang of it plus different shifts puts a lot of stress on me and I think it's not good with your overall health. Given that webdev is fairly in demand in the country where I live, I have always that hunger to build something which can be turn too as a hobby if only I just trust myself before, so I'm taking a leap to become one.\n\nAt the moment I have only the basic knowledge of HTML and CSS. I've build a project before that involves Java Script and PHP but I fairly forgotten all of it.\n\nI work 8 hours a day and I travel to my work and go home 4 hours combined (usually), which only gives me a little time to study webdev if I plan to study on weekdays. \n\nSo guys what are the best advice that you can give me right now in terms of time management, career path (full stack, back end, front end), study materials to use? and to somebody that can relate to me who manage to become a successful web developer, what's your story?\n\n**TL;DR**: What are the best advice you can give for a career shifter who works 8 hours a day with only basic knowledge of webdev?\n\nP.S.

Having been out of the front lines of web development for a while now (re: mid 2000's) I find there seems to be a billion different frameworks for things.  I will try and distill this down to a couple of core questions;\n\nThe website needs to be ultra fast and secure, so we will be going with a static design, as we do not require any dynamic aspects on the public facing side, except perhaps a newsletter signup portion.\n\n1) We want to have an Articles / News / Blog type section where we will be posting developed learning articles, company news, etc.  Where I am stuck is what tool(s) to use to drive this portion of the site?  I would like to avoid wordpress, or any other CMS type solution as the site is already basically designed and being filled with copy.  We dont need any interaction in this section, just a list of articles, each article page showing the author, date, a picture or two, and the article itself.  My thoughts on this was to perhaps manually build out the pages every time a new article comes out (we have people on staff that could handle this) as they release schedule will not be all that often, at most I forsee one a month.  My second idea as I despise all things manual was some kind of script (this is where googling brought me across things like jekyll) that would suck the data out of a flat file, and put it into our \"article\" template, then we can deploy as normal via git.  From some brief reading on jekyll and the like however it seems you are limited to the templates they support, and are designed to do the entire website not just a portion of it.\n\nCan someone point me in the right direction for this, or perhaps some additional literature that will shed some light on it for me.",

If you have any suggestions on what to use and what MAY look similar to brackets in it's \"lightweight\" look - feel free to comment please.\n* Node and Ruby (for SASS) are installed. I currently use grunt to process SASS and minify it. If there is a better suggestion: also feel free to comment.\n\ni also have no clue how other frontend-devs dev-environments look like because most of the time of the last 6 years i was working alone... so if you have suggestions feel free.\n\nmy goal is to learn to write SPAs with JS-Frameworks like React. \n\ncan you provide me some ressources / help / courses or suggestions on what to learn? (e.g. React / Angular / Vue / i don't know)\n\nwhy is everything so complicated? i tried to setup something with Node+Express+React+Babel+idon'tknow and it simply didn't work - even if i followed a simple tutorial step. all i got were some errors and Node told me the server was running with no errors.\n\nis there any approach i miss? should i really go all way back and start from the bottom at vanillaJS? this would take years! i made the mistake 5 years ago. everything seemed so simple with jQuery and my mate told me \"no. go the vanilla way!\" and i said \"why? it's so much less to write and it's way easier - why should i?\" but yeah... he was probably right. \n\nbut i can't fix what happened in the past - thats why i ask you guys. how can i fix this mess, i did to myself? how can i learn writing js-frontends the fastest way?\n\nSorry if my gramma is horrible wrong or something.

I built out my backend a while ago using elixir + phoenix, but recently re-wrote it in nodeJS (because I will wait for the libs on elixir/phoenix to mature a bit, and also I need to really master elixir/erlang tbh).  Its just a graphQL server + postgres + redis.\n\nThe backend has JWT + refresh tokens auth working fine, and I am good on the mobile client side of things. \n\nBut I have a big problem on the web side - my login page is server rendered (I could change this later, but for now I'm just doing this for tracking).  So if you navigate to my site, say `www.mysite.com` you'll be redirected to `/login` to continue with Facebook.  If you click the button, you're sent back to `www.mysite.com` and I serve up the SPA assets (client is written in react).\n\nI'm using good 'ol session here.  I store a session token that's valid for 7 days and it is used only ONCE when you navigate to `www.mysite.com`.  Each time you come to the site, the token is refreshed.  The SPA uses my graphQL backend and it stores its JWT in localstorage.  \n\nIs this a bad idea?  I'm pretty new to authentication and I've never directly had to work with it before.  ",

I've wanted to lean on previous experience with angular (well, Angular 1) and new learning with node. \n\nThere have seemed to be guidance around json web tokens floating around to make UAC work in a stack like that, but my lack of experience is a bit hobbling with complexities added through several recent updates to Angular. It sounds like you can write a secure Angular app with UAC as long as  node is there. I've already combed the interweb for guidance and I'm coming up a bit short.\n\nI have an idea I want to play with but it requires user access control (which I haven't done before). I'm not a seasoned dev, so I find myself amiss with some of the complexity and variability of guidance for JS resulting from the flexibility of JS.\n\nAnyone know a JS stack that can be used to quickly build an app with UAC already integrated? I planned to build some needed middleware in node but am not wedded to that. ",

As I want to become a freelancer in web development I thought I'd have to be more up to date with the latest technologies. Therefore I have been reading a lot about the javascript frameworks etc. and, although still being a bit overwhelmed by all the different options, I decided to start a project using React.js.\n\nI've used create-react-app with react-router-dom and node-sass-chokidar to start up my project. Now I would perhaps have used something like HTML5Boilerplate before, which contained helper CSS files like normalize.css but also some other cross-browser fixes in main.css.\n\nI was wondering, what am I still missing for a good begin of my project? Any suggestions? Or what do you use? I read that create-react-app comes with autoprefixer so that fixes a lot of cross-browser issues but the other possibilities of packages to add still seem a little overwhelming...\n\nI prefer not to use a full framework like Bootstrap though. I'm aiming more towards things like normalize.css (although I'm not even sure if I'm supposed to use that in combination with React.js).",

For some reason on this new site I'm working on (new server as well), it's not working at all. And by it's not working, I mean running the site thru pagespeed results in a suggestion to leverage browser caching, as none of my assets have expiry dates. I have confirmed that the Request Headers all contain \"Cache-Control:no-cache\". Am I just really tired, or what am I doing wrong?\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n<IfModule mod_expires.c>  \nExpiresActive On  \nExpiresByType image/jpg \"access 1 year\"  \nExpiresByType image/jpeg \"access 1 year\"  \nExpiresByType image/gif \"access 1 year\"  \nExpiresByType image/png \"access 1 year\"  \nExpiresByType text/css \"access 1 month\"  \nExpiresByType text/html \"access 1 month\"  \nExpiresByType application/pdf \"access 1 month\"  \nExpiresByType text/x-javascript \"access 1 month\"  \nExpiresByType application/x-shockwave-flash \"access 1 month\"  \nExpiresByType image/x-icon \"access 1 year\"  \nExpiresDefault \"access 1 month\"  \n</IfModule>  \n\n<IfModule mod_headers.c>  \n\t<filesMatch \".(css|jpg|jpeg|png|gif|js|ico)$\">  \n\tHeader set Cache-Control \"max-age=2628000, public\"  \n\t</filesMatch>  \n</IfModule>  \n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\nPlease advise, I don't know what else to try.

            "selftext": "Have to share this with people who will understand.\n\nJust had a big meeting involving the higher-ups about a product where I'm for the first time working together with the lead-developer of our most important products.\n\nHe interviewed me in front of everybody how I would go about solving some special problems he forsaw and I got so much drawn into the technical aspects of our conversation that I totally forgot that the bosses were at the table with us. He seemed skeptical about my skills and I knew exactly what he was thinking about me.\n\nYou know, I'm always too much fixated on the many, many problems in my CV... abandoned university studys after just one semester, then professional training as a designer in a failing company, never as a developer. Beeing completely self-taught without any professional training as a developer, no courses, no bootcamps, no group-meetings, never having worked in a team, never seen how other developers work. Just lots of reading, surfing and actual programming that (in my mind) was more or less \"trial & error - make it work somehow\".\n\nBut during our conversation I focused on the technical aspects and I had all the answers. I knew exactly what technologies to use and how to tell the person who wrote our MVC-Framework that I'm actually used to working with those and what standards I would expect to find and how I would build with best-practices upon those.\n\nThen we were done and he told me all my answers were perfect and exactly what he was looking for. He then asked me if I had the time to help with the mobile-friendliness off all our products. \n\nSuddenly I felt competent. \n\nThis is something I don't feel often, my imposter syndrome synergizes well with a chronic depression.\n\nBut at that moment, when I realized how pleased he was with my answers, and that the higher-ups were actually in the same room and seeing how the lead-developer was impressed with me... I felt so much accomplishment. So much pride and happiness. \n\nSee now I feel a bit like a braggart again, but I felt I just had to share this here, because I know I'm not the only one on this sub who wrestles with these spurious feelings of beeing a fraud and I kind of wanted to share my win with everybody who feels the same. \n\nThose little voices are shittalkers who want to drag you down! Don't let it get to you! You don't need the perfect CV, you don't need to let yourself be dragged down by bad decisions you made in the past. Heck I've spend 4 years in university, only studied one semester of those and wasted the other 7 semesters locked into my flat playing MMOs. Then I made an apprenticeship as a Designer (**I AM A SHITTY DESIGNER**) where the only good grades I got were in digital-media production.\n\nNow I'm working a very good job (not a dream job, but that's only because the pay could be a bit higher) in a big company that feels like a good place to be and appreciates my skills despite my broken CV.\n\n\n**TL:DR**\n\nNo matter how bad your vita is, how many bad decisions you made in the past, how fucked up your way to where you are now is. Don't let that drag you down and make you feel like a fraud. If competent people tell you they regard you as competent. You most like are!",

I built a webpage and deployed it to a live server and I am currently in the process of learning angular, I feel pretty well-versed in JavaScript in general, hence the lead with front end as a preference.\n\n I am looking for any good advice on how I can improve my skills as a developer to better my odds at landing a junior position hopefully for next semester but at the very least for when I graduate. My GPA is pretty high (magna cum laude, so long as I don't blow this semester), and I'm I will be receiving my B.S in CS with a minor im philosophy. \n\nThanks for any advice!",

It cannot involve paying a monthly fee for now and I have multiple sites to manage this way.\n\nI am building websites on the LAMP stack on my own VPS (todays site deployment is a WordPress site for example) so I obviously have root access. SSH is all set up with a public key and git is installed on the VPS.\n\nToday I will be deploying from dev > staging > production for the first time using ssh and before I learn an approach I would like your input.\n\nMy workflow: \n\nI have a private repo for each site hosted with Github and I develop locally on my dev machine (MAMP for Windows / Browsersync). Any changes made locally are pushed to the repo. I am aware of other options such as Vagrant which I have played with but for now I would like to focus on the deployment process unless changing how I develop locally is integral to getting it set up right.\n\nI have a domain setup as staging on the VPS to allow my clients to review the site before going live. I currently manually transfer my files and database (and theme settings) from dev to staging with FTP and manually run the search and replace for the database with an sql command in phpmyadmin.\n\nOnce the site is finalised and signed off I copy it from staging to production and go live (ftp again.)\n\nObviously I am trying to get a professional workflow going, it's the whole reason I bought a VPS ($2000 per year for one based in my state in Australia). \n\nThe goal is any changes made locally to dev get automatically pushed to staging when I commit them to the repo. I would also like to automate copying the database along with a find and replace to change the URL's to the staging domain?\n\nWhen the time comes, I want to run a command to push everything from staging > production. I would also like to be able to transfer the db back from production > staging > local for future dev down the track.\n\nJenkins seems like a good option but I don't know much about it, before I go knee deep, what do you reckon? I don't want to learn something that's already out of date. \n\nI've got all day to get something set up. Looking forward to hearing some suggestions.\n\n",

And a lot of them are also out of date because of the pace of web dev technology. \n\n\nSo here would be the credo that every tutorial has to abide by: \n\n* Text based\n* Editorial-free / Non-opinionated\n* Reasonably succinct without sacrificing depth\n* Up to date\n* Error/typo-free\n* Relevant to the topic throughout\n* Not too similar to an already existing tutorial\n\n\nAnd for anyone familiar with Genius (a site for lyrics), users can add annotations at specific points in the lyrics to add explanations. A similar feature could be used for Wikorial, where users can add annotations at specific points to point out questionable statements or provide clarification, which could then possibly be used to change the tutorial if enough users approved of it. Something like that. \n\nAnd obviously the idea extends past tutorials just for web dev. It could be used for any type of tutorial. Wikipedia shows you what something is, but I can't find a similar service for how to do something. \n\nEdit: Another thing I want to point out is accessibility. A lot of \"premium\" tutorials are behind a subscription for that site. And each one of those sites has their own UI/dashboard to navigate and get familiar with. Wikorial would be 100% free and would have a super minimalist design like Wikipedia to just focus on the content itself. ",

(i want to be precisely correct) \n\nSo my question is: why signalling server couldn't just add correct ice into sdp while transferring, because it's reaching to each client, it knows right path to each.\n\nFinally, need some practical advice: what library can i use to easily setup signalling and STUN server. Should i integrate signalling server within express or run a service in addition to web server.\n\nI want my apps to use public stun servers and if they fail then use my stun server.\n\nSince it's already too complicated as is,  i dont want to get into how to setup realy/TURN server.

I was an apprentice and was 1 of 3 people in the team (the company owner, a director, and me). We do all sorts of technology at this company including IT support and the like, but I've always had the suspicion that we only started to offer websites because my boss knows they make money...\n\nSo when I first started here we used Adobe Muse to build all of our websites (a WYSIWYG program), and I felt like there was lots of room to improve here so we could build websites with a CMS or e-commerce system, so I spent months teaching myself HTML, (S)CSS, PHP and JavaScript, and as a result we now offer WordPress websites or anything else the customer wants.\n\nMy boss couldn't even explain what HTML and CSS do. It's hard to feel like a valued asset when your boss doesn't understand your job.\n\nI've also recently started looking into Vue.js and also hope to learn another popular framework such as Angular or React - again, this is completely in my own time.\n\nIs it worth me searching for another job? I'm worried my JavaScript skills aren't good enough to work in a more professional environment, but I love the industry and I'm very very willing to devote months of my own time to learning even more.\n\nLate night rant so please ignore my grammar, but this has been on my mind for a very long time now.

Hopefully some of you will find this tool useful.\n\n\nIt's a drag and drop interface for creating css grid-areas, which can be used with display: grid; for creating flexible grid layouts. My inspiration for this tool came from watching this video: [CSS Grid Changes EVERYTHING](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/6qrh0n/css_grid_changes_everything/). \n\n\nIt uses Vue.js with vuex and vue-router, started from vue-cli. It was pretty easy to get started with this tooling, and the state management makes it easy to keep the generated CSS up to date as the grid is changed.\n\n\nGetting the drag and drop placement, and the dynamic resizing working was a pretty big challenge. I'm not quite happy with how resize works. The thing is it's hard to know how tall or wide the area could be (since each row/column can have a specific size), making it difficult to know when to expand or contract. It gets the job done, it's just a little janky. \n\n\nCheck out [Grid-Awesome](http://www.louisbourque.ca/grid-awesome/) and view the source on [GitHub](https://github.com/louisbourque/grid-awesome).

I've worked through a couple Udemy courses (including Colt Steele's), Lynda.com courses, and done a fair amount of individual research learning through working on personal projects and just playing around.\n\nMy long-term goal is to get a job as web developer, but in the shorter term before I am 'job-ready', it would be very nice to make a little cash to help support all the time I am spending in the code editor.\n\nAt this point, I feel pretty confident building static websites, although I only have a couple to show in my portfolio. I'm getting at two questions here:\n\n1) What resources would you recommend for moving forward? It's very frustrating when introduced to a new learning platform and having to go through all the basics over and over again, so I'm wondering if there are any good resources out there for the 'advanced beginner'.\n\n2) Recommendations for how to make some money? Not expecting huge paychecks, but a little cash on the side would be very helpful. Upwork or Freelancer? My girlfriend and I are trying to start a freelance design/development business (she is very good with graphic design), so this hopefully would turn into another option. Any other suggestions?\n\nI've been working with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and Bootstrap mainly.",

            "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nThis is my first time building an interactive game. I use setInterval to do something, then call a function called nextThing() which is my attempt to keep synchronicity while determining the next thing to be done. \n\nUnfortunately I am finding it very hard to keep track of the state of my application (e.g. when is it playing a pattern? When is it listening to user input?).\n\nI would love some feedback on my JavaScript code structure. I am aware that it is a mess and there are function calls and state setting all over the place. I just don't know how to approach the problem of keeping track of the applications state! \n\nThe main issue is that I only want certain actions to be performed AFTER setInterval has finished playing a sequence. The only way to do that is by calling functions INSIDE setInterval(function(){/**here*/}, time).\n\nAny advice in that regard would be very helpful, here is the pen: https://codepen.io/jethazelhurst/pen/wrvboM\n\nMany thanks for your time and feedback!",

It should have huge tiles and the standard Go Back, Home buttons etc. so they dont get confused.\n\nA current working model exists, I did it with bootstrap/materialize etc. and then just basic JS.\n\n[This is a very basic concept in Paint to give you an idea] (https://i.imgur.com/8JaqpEn.png)\n\nIt all works well and there seems to be no problem.\n\nBut my question is now, would there have been an easier way to do this? Maybe using existing frameworks etc. \n\nThe content of the tiles are currently static and I thought about using ASP.NET and pulling that from a DB (problem is, we dont have a Windows server).\n\nI'm specially interested in the design part. I'm more into programming and am lacking in that department but it has to look pretty/well built as its for children.\n\nI appreciate any ideas on how to (re)build this/making it in an easier/better way!\n\n",

How do I approach my manager and admit that I've wasted a bunch of time trying and failing to figure things out, and ask for 1:1 guidance without making him regret his decision to hire me? \n\nI started working at a company on a contract basis in June. I became an official employee this month. It's my first job as a developer after spending a decade in a totally unrelated field. \n\nFor the last few months I've been working in languages and frameworks I'm comfortable with - Javascript, python, etc. Lots of new stuff too, but nothing I couldn't figure out. The company is now on maintenance-only mode on their current stack, as they are switching over to a brand new stack. By brand new I mean BRAND new - the whole thing was written by a guy and my company bought it from him and subsequently hired him to lead one of the dev teams. The system is a novel concept, an entirely new proprietary architecture and templating system, written mostly in Java and requiring work in, among other things, Java, XML, and an external content management system (and front end stuff in react, mustache, etc). What little experience I have in web development has been limited to traditional MVC architecture (eg Rails, Django, MEAN).\n\nThere is very little documentation for this system. We are supposed to write it as we go. There are no online tutorials, no stackoverflow answers, no slack groups I can join. (obviously I can find answers for each individual component, but not the system as a whole)\n\nI'm totally lost. I have spent hours reviewing the codebase and PRs to try to get an understanding of how it all works and I'm still clueless. I asked for a deep dive demo, which my boss gave us this week, but unfortunately he kept it at such a high level that it didn't help me at all.   The \"deep dive\" ended up being this high level discussion of the philosophy behind it and a look at a few of the tools we'll be using. There was no discussion of how each component communicates with the others, or what each component even does. I want to see how you add a div to a page. Or how you pass a freaking variable to the template. The most basic of tasks are still ridiculously unclear at this point.\n\nIve wasted the last 2 days trying to figure out how to approach one simple task and I'm incredibly frustrated. I'm on a small team and only one developer knows it well enough to teach me anything, but he's been out of the office. There is one other dev who is quite senior, but he's new to the company and he has been able to jump in and start doing some basic tasks in the codebase. \n\nI just feel super dumb at this point. I really wanted to be able to figure this out myself the way I have with lots of other things at this company, but it's not happening. And I'm really nervous about asking for an actual tutorial on the basics, because (a) everyone is stretched thin and a 1:1 tutorial is a lot to ask for, and (b) the senior dev on my team didn't need a tutorial and I'm afraid I will look dumb and inexperienced because I *do* need it.\n\nIs it normal for a new dev to need more support/training for foreign concepts? Is this something I should be able to figure out myself (in which case I will be terrified that I made a wrong career move)? How do I approach my manager and admit that I've wasted tons of time trying and failing to figure things out? ",

[Builder](https://ckeditor.com/builder): However, with Builder you have to download a whole new CKEditor, including the config file, etc. What if I want to add a plugin to an existing project?\n\n2. Downloading plugins manually: However with this, there is no package management. There is seemingly no way to download plugins with their proper dependencies. All I can do is download it, see if it works, and when my browser says \"Missing plugin xxx\", I download that dependency (manually). Out of principle, I shouldn't have to download dependencies manually, but even if I did, I'm afraid of the one time my browser won't throw an error for a missing dependency for whatever reason. Then it won't be working and I'll be completely in the dark as to why.\n\nHow do people normally approach downloading and managing plugins for existing projects with CKEditor?",

Similarly - with the logo garden - each image is not set as a background for its container until after DOM load.\n\nSo the question is (and I apologize if I have not described the code well enough to ascertain the answer): Why am I getting tagged for these images as part of my initial page load if they come in after DOM ready?

The thing that drives me in life is coming up with product ideas, validating them, and then building them. I come home after work and study and write code, and build side projects.\n\nLately, I've really been loving programming, and am considering transitioning to being a full-time web dev while continuing to build/launch side projects after work. I genuinely love studying and writing code, and coming up with creative and elegant solutions to programming problems. However, what drives me above all is building useful products for other people - I think that being a developer will give me more stable income and time & energy to work on my own projects than being a PM would.\n\nMy fear is that the joy I feel coding now will go away when I have to work on assignments for products/jobs I don't care about, and I'll have less energy to work on my own coding assignments after I'm done at work.  **Moreover, I'm afraid that as a dev, I'll have no say in the product vision.** I realize that this is a contradiction - if what I *really* want is to build my own products, should I come to terms that I don't need to be involved in defining what products get built at my job?\n\n1. Has anyone here worked as a PM/could share experience between the two roles?\n2. As a dev, how much say do you have in shaping the product vision?\n3. Do you work on your own side projects? How do you split your creative energy between work and your own projects?",

I was thinking about Angular but I wouldn't use all its capability as we have got Python backend. I was pretty sure about using React, but I've been scared off by their patent licensing (site is not competition for facebook, but I think I would prefer something without unnecessary bounds). \nSo my thought comes to Vue, as it easy to learn and looks like React on steroids, which suits me.\n\nWhat I'm looking for is: \n* To communicate Front and Backend through Python API (probably json files). \n* Easy to to learn framework with documentation and some living community. \n*Nice to have possibility to use existing code with some Native scripts to create mobile apps.\n\nCheers for help!",

I'd like to run a weekly newsletter but this costs about $50 to send through AWS SES meaning it would cost $2500 a year to have this newsletter.\n\nThe site is just a fansite which doesn't make money (already costs money just to host it) so I can't really justify that cost.\n\nIn the past we always ran on plesk/cpanel and it had email, although they would always get stuck in queues and take days to send to that many people so it wasn't great.\n\nWe use SES now which is much better, but it's just transactional emails like password recovery, it's too expensive for a newsletter.\n\nWe run on digital ocean with an ubuntu server just running nginx/php so no mail server configured and definitely too difficult to do properly myself.\n\nBut that means it's impossible to do a weekly newsletter? Or even not weekly, it's still $50 just to make an announcement.\n\nI've considered just buying a cheap hosting package with cpanel or plesk and doing mail through there, but it would likely flag up as spam or have the previous issues of taking 3 days to send to everyone and less reliably than SES.\n\nWhat other options are there? Everyone says AWS is cheap and obviously $50 to half a million people if you're selling a product is great, it's definitely alot cheaper than mailchimp ($2000 a month?), but for a hobby it's still alot.\n\nThere seems to a gap where it's cheap to run a hobby site with server costs so low these days, but impossible to utilise email? (at $50 a week this would be more than the actual hosting costs).\n\nThe only thing I can think of would be a pre-configured AWS instance or equivalent, that was designed specifically for sending mail but self-hosted rather than as a service.\n\nDoes such a thing exist?

The thing ist that most of my clients don't have a static ip so I thought that if they block Google Analytics on their own site, they wouldn't generate traffic in google analytics.\n\nSome of my clients do check their website several times and that falsifies the data.\n\nThe solution should work on Linux, MacOS and Windows.\n\nHope this is the right subreddit and someone can help me.",

The website is set up completely, but I am having some trouble with SSL.\n\nI know that Chrome is starting to give people big red messages if a site doesn't have SSL, but it's not worth me paying for at the moment, so I'm trying to get a free certificate with letsencrypt. However, I am having some weird problem with uploading the files to demonstrate the site is mine.\n\nI was given two files to upload to [my root folder]/.well-known/acme-challenge. When I put these files /.well-known, I can view them exactly as I am intended to be able to. However, if I put them into /.well-known/acme-challenge, I am told there is nothing there.\n\nAlso, for the record, I'm with 000webhost (I know, cheapskate, lmao) and I am not using Wordpress (my own html shit).\n\nIf you need to ask any other questions to help me, please do. :)\n\nThanks!\n\n-Dafaria\n\nUPDATE: I got it somewhat working?

I have looked at junior web dev positions in my area and a lot do not require a degree, just experience.\n\nI am considering the Complete Web Development course on Udemy, it seems to cover a lot of ground and has multiple projects where you make stuff.\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated and suggestions for online courses are welcome.",

I got a bugfix today at work for a site that I did none of the work on and was built at least 2 years ago(at the earliest).\n\nSite uses the Mapplic plugin(an outdated version) I am sure.\n\nThe issue I have run into is that when the less is compiled down into the minified css there seem to be classes not in the less file that is minified.\n\nI checked the css file for the plugin and saw that there are classes not getting style applied on the live site. \n\nThe less file is importing the correct file, but those classes are not in the compiled CSS file. \n\nHas anyone seen this before where a less compile removes classes? Whoever built the site used grunt. Could that be causing issues as well?\n\nEDIT: On closer inspection it seems like the minified css file doesn't even do the imports. Still has them listed like they never happened. \n\nEDIT 2: Title is super misleading. It seems like the imports are just not happening. The minified css file is still trying to import files instead of being the fully imported and compiled css.",

            "selftext": "So recently a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/6z8s2o/you_shall_not_bear_false_witness_against_your/) showed up that prompted a [serious question](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/6z8s2o/you_shall_not_bear_false_witness_against_your/dmtt5sw/) about why javascript seems so loathed by developers.  I offered an outsider's view of why that is (which wasn't well received), but it got me thinking about what little I do know and a few questions formed:\n\n1.  Do you *actually* like javascript?\n2.  If you could use *any* language as a first class citizen in a browser, what would it be?\n3.  Why would you use that language, besides the fact that it likely isn't javascript (or if it is javascript, why it over any other language?)\n\nBackground:\n\nI'm a long time programmer, mostly C++ and Java, though I'm also working C# of late and have a goal to learn Python.  I know about javascript second hand at best through friends who code with it.  For all that they (and other random people in the internet) accomplish, it seems very much like this is a language of rapid obsolescence and masochism.  Knowing where the language came from, and all the trappings it's stuck with because of backward compatibility, I just can't really understand its popularity either.  Going off numerous videos [like this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGws1pMWzCI), doing a simple task on a page can sometimes have you downloading a ridiculous number of libraries.  This doesn't seem like a language that's ideal, it's just the only language that works in the space of web design (especially now that Flash is on its way out).  And when people attempt to make alternative languages (Haxe, Dart) they seem like they're actively shunned unless they transcompile into javascript.  So I just want to make some sense out of this, and I'm curious if this small(ish) subset of webdevs here on reddit actually prefer how web development currently works.\n\nI'm not asking for flame wars or religious debates (though I don't doubt this will start a few).  I legitimately want answers.",

But I hope someone will be able to give me some pointers :).\n\nLet's say you're making an app like airbnb where users send requests or inquiries to hosts in order to book a reservation. Hosts can then respond to the inquiries with an accept or decline with a personal message, etc.\n\nHowever, you want to show users how timely various hosts are. So, next to their names, it will display something like \"average response time: 2 hours\" or \"median response time: 1.5 hours\".\n\nWhat would be the best way to store this data? \n\nFor example, should you create a table in your DB simply called `response times`, with a column for `host` and another for `amount_of_time_till_first_response`? And record the time between every single interaction between a host and a user in that table?\n\nOr, should you try to infer this information by somehow scouring some other data you have? For example, if you record all the messages between hosts/users (with timestamps), run through them and then calculate based on timestamps?\n\nThanks in advance for your insight!",

            "selftext": "Good morning everyone, I have a question regarding building websites from the ground up (custom HTML, and CSS).\n\nI've recently started on my journey to become a web developer and I'm loving every second of it! I'n fact, I've enjoyed to the point to where I'm strongly considered going into freelance instead of working for an employer. \n\nI'm currently going the Colt Steele Bootcamp and the FreeCodeCamp modules and I've finished the portion on HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. I figure a good way to practice these new skills would be to start with making my own portfolio site/blog. I have some questions regarding how this all comes together. Please bear with me as I share these thoughts....Im not sure how these all, fit if they fit at all, or if I'm missing anything.\n\n* I know I need web hosting. I also know that I can use HTML, CSS, and a framework like Bootstrap to style the front-end portion of my site/blog.\n\n* If I add content to to my site like a link to a web-app or site I built or a new blog post, it'd be incredibly inefficient to have to create a new HTML page every time I have content to add....I think this is where Content Management Systems come in? They allow people to just focus on the content instead of having to create a page over and over again.\n\nI think I have those basics understood. After that, things get a bit confusing for me:\n\n1. I know that CMS's like Wordpress offer generic themes that people can use for the front-end. But what if you don't want to use them and you want to use something that you built from scratch? Are CMS's no longer an option?\n\n2. If a cms is no longer an option, what are the alternatives if there are any?\n\n3. it seems that all CMS's rely on PHP? why is that and? what role so these server-side languages play in a CMS?\n\n4. Are there CMS's that use javascript? Its not that I have anything against learning PHP. I just want want to get get started with the tools at disposal now if possible.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this :)\n\n",

I just want to be able to have a store in various languages and currencies and that supports shipping fees, expeditions, discount codes, PayPal & Stripe, customer registration, customer support (tawk.to) and other basic functionalities.\n\nI've been looking on the Internet, Reddit and many other places about what would be the best solution for me. I know HTML and CSS and I have basic notions of PHP, Twig, Sass and JavaScript. I have looked at WooCommerce and Prestashop and don't really know what to choose.\n\nThe pros of WooCommerce are that I already know Wordpress, there are lots of themes and plugins and the community is huge. But in the cons, Wordpress seems to often encounter security issues, it's not a software dedicated to e-commerce and it seems you have to supercharge your website with many extensions in order to have a proper store with all the needed functionalities.\n\nOn the other side, you have Prestashop that is dedicated to e-commerce but the community is way smaller, the themes and extensions are pretty expensive and many people are complaining about the various bugs, the slow development and the overall speed of Prestashop.\n\nBut I've also seen that around one year ago, some developers have forked the project. It's named Thirty Bees and their goal is to correct the bugs, get rid of many dependencies and start fresh with a clean code base.\n\nSince I only need an e-commerce platform (no blog or other things), Prestashop would seem like the ideal choice but with the bugs, slowdowns and other things, WooCommerce seems more stable and friendly. And what about Thirty Bees that would seem like Prestashop without all the bugs and all?\n\nSo, should I use Prestashop to have a purely e-commerce platform with the support of the community, should I use Thirty Bees to have a *cleaner and faster* Prestashop or should I go with WooCommerce in order to have an easy and friendly solution with all the ressources and support from the community that goes along?\n\nIf anyone could help me, that would be much appreciated!\n\nPS: I haven't mentioned solutions like Shopify because I want to fully control my store and not have to pay a monthly fee to use it.\n\nEdit: typos",

They commissioned it, but I've had a hard time getting them to spec any of the business processes or feature requirements, so I had to handle the business side and process improvement when building the new app.\n\nThe past two months I've asked my team to write verbage for the site (FAQs, project submission instructions, etc) and I ship the final product in two weeks - they haven't done anything even though I gave them a full spec with bullet points for what I need. I also shipped a demo for them to test last week, and nobody has even logged into it, despite us holding an entire team meeting about it!\n\nThis is a weird situation because I can't really escalate this to a step supervisor or another director, because of the way my group works. So it seems like I can either do EVERYTHING myself (business side, writing the legal verbage AND shipping the webapp) or try and force the hand of my team, which seems to not be working.\n\nAlternatively, I could leave the team and accept an offer at a startup.

            "selftext": "In mobile Safari, there is an issue involving the native bottom menu.\n\nIf your site has a fixed-position `<footer>` and the native bottom menu is not present (e.g. when scrolling up), your footer doesn't do what you expect when you press it. In fact, it just opens the native bottom menu. When that happens, you can use your footer, because the native bottom menu is showing.\n\nI've always thought this was a dumb thing in mobile Safari. To get around it, I've used the tips on this blog post: https://www.eventbrite.com/engineering/mobile-safari-why/\n\nIt outlines three css properties you can attach to your `html` and `body` tags so that the native bottom menu *always* shows, and therefore your footer *always* works when you tap it.\n\nI've noticed that a fair few sites don't make use of the tips in the post above. \n\n\u2022 Is this because their devs don't care about the issue, or they don't know about it?\n\n\u2022 Do you think it's an issue at all or are you happy with the native behaviour of Safari?\n\n\u2022 Are there any downsides to using this approach?\n\n\u2022 Will Safari always be like this?",

The small number is not what's important here, so don't focus on that.\n\nThe Cloudflare load balancing service gives 500000 DNS queries for free, then $0.50 for each additional block of 500000 \"authoritative DNS queries against Cloudflare's name servers\": https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005254367-Billing-for-Load-Balancing\n\nThe bill shows 1.2 million DNS queries. If that is true then the pricing is correct.\n\nThe problem is there were only about 2.2 million total HTTP requests that went through Cloudflare that month. When you consider that most visits to my website result in over 30 HTTP requests over the 3 minutes the average user spends on the website, AND that most of my visitors are active users who regularly visit the website, I find it hard to comprehend that over HALF of ALL HTTP requests resulted in an authoritative DNS query.\n\nFurthermore, the Cloudflare document I linked above says this: \"You can reduce the number of authoritative DNS queries by configuring your Load Balancer as \"proxied\" (orange cloud) for your HTTP(S) services\". All my requests go through the \"orange cloud\". So if that wasn't the case, how many DNS queries would there be? All 2.2 million HTTP requests?\n\nMaybe I'm missing something here?",

The mouse can never be on the content because if it leaves the <li> the website just shows back the image of the day -  \n\nSo my idea was to have the video play when you hover the corresponding <li> and pause when you stop hovering the <li>  (or maybe just stop and go back to the beginning) - but i cannot get it to work for some reason. I looked online and found lots of info about play and pause on hover the video, but not on hovering another element. \n\nAnother way to do it could be to have the video playing only when it is visible- \n\nIf anybody has a trick for this it would be awesome, im sure it's pretty simple but i just can't find it and im not a very good coder. \n\nHave a great day, thanks",

It's the first project I've ever released publicly, and hopefully the first of many.\n\nOn the one hand, it's an experiment to see whether people are interested in something like a \"Twitch plays chess\" style of game with democratic voting and player rankings. On the other, it's a personal challenge to see whether it's possible to create a game on the web with a moderate degree of interactivity and yet not write a single line of JavaScript. As it turns out, there are interesting ways you can abuse the [:checked pseudo-selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:checked) to build interaction flows. And since it's all HTML and CSS, you can view any page's source to see the tricks I used, free of obfuscation.\n\nThe backend is written in plain Go with a dash of help from Node.js for a few AWS Lambda functions. I've open-sourced [several of the pieces](https://gitlab.com/eightsquared) that make up Move by Numbers, so should you ever need Go libraries to [describe and manipulate chess positions](https://godoc.org/gitlab.com/eightsquared/chess), [render images of those positions](https://godoc.org/gitlab.com/eightsquared/chessboard), or even [draw identicons for users](https://godoc.org/gitlab.com/eightsquared/ident), the code I've written is just a \"go get\" away.\n\nWhat do you think?

The book seems to be literally written for dummies; it uses many words to convey very little meaning and piles on truisms and pages-long descriptions of self-descriptive words. So I'm looking for an alternative. \n\nCan you recommend a good, basic book on project management? Preferably one that covers both traditional project management as well as newer techniques like scrum and agile development. Also preferably with a focus on web development projects.

            "selftext": "Hi,\n\nCurrently the way to avoid excessive reflows and repaints on the page that is currently being created -- and yet without disrupting attached event listeners -- is to use DOM _fragments_ and/or use \"display:none\" for the time being.\n\nHowever, neither of those methods are good if your script only starts to work when the page is already ready and you have to update it without disrupting attached event listeners.\n\n_Cloning_ even in JQuery version will not do since the way it works requires for JQuery's event listener wrapper to capture all of the other event listeners on the fly when the page was initially loaded. This is not the situation when the script is only loaded after the page is already ready.\n\nAnother method would be to use _display:none_ on the whole DOM _body_, then update the DOM, and then revert it, but this would obviously cause a blink, which is inacceptable.\n\nThus this situation could only be resolved if a new version of DOM will support either or both of the following:\n\n1) _display:freeze_ style that would ban all of the reflows and repaints for an element until the style is reverted;\n\n2) _cloneWithAttachedEventListeners_ method that would allow programmers to update a DOM element outside, id est without causing reflows and repaints, and then to merge/copy/replace it is back with the active DOM to cause only one reflow/repaint.\n\nDoes anyone know if W3C considers either or both of such features for DOM5/6 at all, or it makes no sense to expect anything like this?\n\n",

Is it worthwhile to try and come up with a \"job title\" for each item on my work history?

On the one hand I have little in the way of full-time company experience. On the other hand I've learned and used so many of the relevant web development skills that these companies are looking for. I often find myself checking every box on the list of required skills for jobs I've applied for, but I often have trouble actually getting past first round interviews.

            "selftext": "So I have been studying front end dev for about a year, primarily through Treehosue's Techdegree but also other resources, and I am working on my portfolio site at the moment. I have a bunch of projects up and I am trying to find work but it seems as if my skillset (HTML, CSS, JS, API, CSS animation, Sass, Git, etc) is not enough for jobs around here (Toronto area). I tried looking for freelance work on sites like upwork but they rejected my application to their site because they said my skills are not in high enough demand. \n\nI really love front end dev. I am currently diving deeper into programming fundamentals with JS and learning React, but I am wondering if I should drop it all and start learning PHP because there seem to be jobs everywhere for it. But I can't stress enough how much I want to be a front end developer. I don't know what to do. \n\nHere are some examples of my work: \nA web app dashboard: https://jasonbwelsh.github.io/web-app-dashboard/\n\nA gallery that takes data from a third party API and display it on the page (sometimes the server does not retrieve the data fully and in such a case you will have to click the buttons again to get the full card sets) https://jasonbwelsh.github.io/public-API-gallery/\n\nAn interactive video player that links the video with a transcript and allows the user to click the transcript to jump to parts of the video: https://jasonbwelsh.github.io/interactive-video-player/\n\nAn interactive photo gallery: https://jasonbwelsh.github.io/interactive-photo-gallery/\n\nAnd I have others, just not as live links yet. Here is my github profile: https://github.com/JasonBWelsh\n\nI am not sure what to do and I would really appreciate any suggestions. Thank you",

            "selftext": "So we have been making an app for the last two years, a screen sharing solution with multiple mouse cursors support and web browser access. \n\nDuring those years, we often worked remotely and had real issues when discussing architecture flaws the app had back then, as doing code review remotely led us to numerous misunderstandings. Most of the time, it finished with the reviewer rewriting everything and nothing was really learned. \n\nAt some point, we eventually realized we could leverage our own creation to effectively address this issue. We then regularly used it to do some pair programming remotely.\n\nIt felt super satisfying to make an app we actually needed in our day-to-day work and at the same time, it felt like some kind of inception. I guess IDE developers do feel the same when they use their previous version to develop the new one.\n\nDo you have similar stories to share?",

I've started working on a project which will be free to use, however there will be a subscription which will give users more features (none of the features will be related to Spotify). This means that the Play button will appear on both 'sides' (free and subscription) parts of the website.\n\nAccording to the terms of use ([here](https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/widgets/terms-of-use/#section-ii-definitions)) under Section IV: Restrictions, widget restrictions \"e. Please note that the Spotify Play Button may not be used for commercial purposes. This restriction does not prohibit you from embedding the Spotify Play Button on Websites that contain advertising.\" Unless this is talking about monetizing the button itself, and that being the sole reason of monetization? According to [this pdf](https://developer.spotify.com/developer-terms-of-use/faq/) you CAN charge money if the widget is not the standalone product.\n\nSo my question is whether I'm allowed to insert that play button (while complying with all the other dev rules of Spotify), and still monitize my website?\n\nI will also need the user to log into Spotify/and collect their playlist songs, not sure if that changes anything.\n\nI'm in the UK.\n\nCheers for any answers!",

            "selftext": "Hey guys,\n\nWe're a small startup and we've been trying to come up with a good solution for a problem at hand. Please keep in mind that we're a small company, so our resources in time and efforts are limited. We've already spent a crazy amount of time on this feature bundle.\n\nPlease bear with me, I need to give context first so you get what's what.\n\n**Context**\n\nWe built a \"Notes\" feature, which is pretty much a chat. People can chat between one another. It's usually 1 to 1, but it can turn into a group chat depending on other things.\n\nWe notify you if someone responded to your note, but **not** through a notification system (we don't have one yet). You have to go through a certain part of your Profile page and the most recent un-seen notes show up first.\n\n**Why \"note\"?**\n\nWe call it \"note\" and not \"message\" because while the feature can be used to chat in real time with someone, its paradigm is closer to an e-mail system. You have line-breaks and you can write a long message, and we don't expect the recipient to be online/in the same window after you've sent your note (even though they can be, but it's very unlikely).\n\n**Problem**\n\nWe want to notify users **by e-mail** that they've received a new note (message).\n\n**Solutions**\n\n- 1 proposed solution is to have a \"Send\" *and* a \"Send and notify by e-mail\" button, so the sender decides if they want their note to be sent out through the website only, **or** through the website *and* to the recipient's e-mail. I'm personally not in favor of this solution. Clunky and confusing. Why wouldn't the sender go for \"Send and notify by e-mail\" everytime? Why have the just \"Send\" button? Why leave that decision to the user?\n\n- On the website, detect if the recipient has seen the sender's new note (in the context where they're having a live back and forth). If they have, don't send an e-mail. If they haven't, send e-mail for every new note.\n\n- Buffer time. Send 1 e-mail notification every X hours, no matter how  many new notes the recipient has received. If a new message is sent after the buffer time period (X), then send only 1 e-mail again for however new messages are being sent out. If, within that hour, the user goes to look at his new messages on the website, cancel the sendout of that e-mail.\n\n- Simply send an e-mail to the user for every new message and allow them to opt-out.\n\nThat is pretty much everything we've thought of so far.\n\nIf you have any better solutions, I would love to hear them.\n\nSorry for the lengthy message and thanks a ton!",

I'm fairly new at this so I might not even have identified the right problem).\n\nI'm working on a computer running Windows 10.\n\nI cloned this repository from github: https://github.com/regulately/regulately-front-end\n\nI have node.js installed in my 'C:\\Program Files' directory.\n\nWhen I run 'npm start' from inside my cloned repository this runs a server at my localhost:3001. However, I am seeing this error in the dev tools console:\n\n**GET http://localhost:5000/dockets net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED**\n\nThis error is being returned from the 'documents.js' file (path: <repo>/client/reducers/document.js).  \n\nIf I'm reading that code correctly, it looks like this is when we try to load documents from the 'documents.json' file (I think this is because this is the front-end only, so it spoofs data returned from the backend for troubleshooting and trying out front-end changes).\n\nThe './dockets' part of the URI makes me thing this has something to do with docking this directory (I don't know what that means, but I'm thinking this is whatever docker helps with???).  Specifically, the 'documents.json' file is in '<repo>/client/mock/documents.json'.  Does that directory need to be accessible from localhost:5000?  (I'm a bit lost on this part - I don't have much experience in passing between front-end and back-end... I've been fairly siloed to one or the other thus far).\n\nIf I'm totally off base here, are there any sources people here would recommend I look into to get an understanding of whatever basics I'm missing here?\n\nThanks for any help you can provide!!!

Anyone have suggestions on how to leverage positive feedback from users? For example, I made, [this](https://tor020.github.io/Killing-Floor-2-Calculator/index.html) for a game community. It has a [steam guide page](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=920604286), and I wanted to know if it would be a good idea to screenshot positive comments, from the guide page or on Reddit and put them on my portfolio. My main question there is, would that make me more appealing to employers / Clients in a significant way? Or is it just more important to have paid work accolades.\n\n1. Is it worth it to mention somewhere that I've had a freelance client on my resume? I've only had one client, but it was paid and there was a contract, it wasn't a lot of money, the work was just fixing his bootstrap layout and building a navbar on his site, the website isn't live anymore, but I do have a copy of the contract. If I should mention that on my resume/portfolio, how should I go about doing it?\n\n1.  Does the website / work history look good enough to realistically be applying for positions with good odds of getting one? Regardless of that, what should I do next to make myself more hirable given what is there?\n ex: more projects, more framework experience, contribute to open source or make more applications for communities. The website I'm talking about here is my [portfolio](https://tor020.github.io) \n1. Is there anything I could do at the moment to make myself more appealing for remote positions?\n\n\nThanks for reading.\n",

I've never had to create a website for someone before, but I've just been asked if I could make one for a client. It would be super simple: literally just a few pictures and some text.\n\nWhere exactly do I start in terms of creating a website for a client? I've searched around, but most of the information i've found is for more complex sites.\n\nSince it's a simple static site, do I still need to pay a monthly fee to keep it up? (Sorry if thats a really dumb question). Would services like Wix or Squarespace be acceptable since it's such a simple site?\n\nThanks in advance for your help.",

            "selftext": "Hi all, I'm a development noob trying to create a mini app for my SO for our anniversary. I am using the term app very loosely, it's actually more like a website with no complicated functionality, and I'm only catering for mobile dimensions considering I would want to show him on mobile/tablet and that's it. \n\n**What it does**\nEssentially, it's a simple site that highlights the things that we have done throughout the years. There will be a browse page for categories for activities (e.g. family, sports, travel, etc.). When he clicks a category, the first activity shows, and he will be able to swipe to the next activity without having to go back to the 'browse' page.\n\n**My background**\nI'm actually a designer so I'm trying to pick the path of least resistance or perhaps, the path of easy execution. I know HTML, CSS, do a bit of JS/jquery for demonstrating interactions/animations for developers. I once did a mini website with similar level of difficulty as this project in badly-written PHP and MySQL.\n\n**The plan so far**\nAlthough this entire site can be static and just pulling info from a json file, I'm actually going to hook this up to a database so I can keep adding things later on with just a form. I also think SO will appreciate the extra effort ;)\n\nI have decided on using MySQL & node.js for the back-end. My issue lies in the front-end. What is the best way for me to do the navigation (swiping back and forth between activities) and data loading? Ideally, I would want to not have to load all data at once. Maybe only the info/images for the activity (n) and one after (n+1), and keep doing that continuously as he swipes along. I don't know what the technical term is for this, but sorta like lazy loading?\n\nThe only way I can think of for this is carousel but I'm a designer and I've grown to hate carousels, and as far as I know, carousels usually load all the data at once.\n\nAny suggestions on what I can do? Any mini framework/plugin that can do this smoothly without a huge learning curve?\n\nAlso I apologize if this is not the right place to post and would appreciate it if someone would direct me to a better subreddit.",

Why does the space affect how the code runs?\nIs this in error in the implementation? Are there any other weird edge cases like this?\n\nEdit: the issue isn't that not adding the space doesn't work. For example, if I did\n\n    077.toString(8)\n\nOr \n\n    1.toString()\n\n\nBoth work. The issue has to do with the base of the number and how ha implements for notation.",

Just a place for web hosting/domain name, that is hopefully free. \n\nI just want something I can put for a link on my github or just to send to a couple people.\n\nI am currently working on my own project, from what I've learned in this course. Nowhere near done. I am just making the bare bones of it to be functional and will launch that eventually. That is one that I am probably going to buy a cheap domain name for, from godaddy or something. \n\nThank you in advance. Once again, this place is great.

            "selftext": "**I just now realised I may have worded the title as if it was an article. It's me asking for help. Sorry if you got clickbaited.**\n\n\nHello,\n\nSo up until now my web dev enviroment consisted of wamp and sublime. But as I am getting better, I am also starting to realise that this is a very basic combinations that with it brings quite a few drawbacks and problems. Aside from the usual compatibility problems, now my gf has also started learning webdev, and will eventually start helping me on projects. So I need your help in telling me how to create a better web dev enviroment. Preferably with git.\n\nMy idea for now is to use an old computer I have as a server to host the actual website files. ( *It's very old, I belive intel core2duo e8400 with something like 4gb ram. Would that be sufficient to run a server?* ) To install windows server on that, and use it as a server. But what to install on that? MySQL and apache? Are there any guides to help me set that up, since i have zero experience. i am willing to learn though.\n\nAnd for cooperating with other devs and accessing the files, i'd like to start using git. I heard good stuff about bitbucket. Can I somehow set up the server to automatically pull master branch updates from git, so that once you commit the updates to the master it shows up?\n\nAlso, a related question: if you use an actual server to develop, instead of WAMP, how can you instantly see the changes you have made? I really liked that I could just save, hit refresh and instantly see the effect. How does that work with a server which is a seperate computer and git code tracking?\n\nAnd finally, is phpstorm good for webdev?\nI know they also have webstorm, but i'm not really that good with java yet. I'm planning on getting on top of that soon, but for now I mostly just use html, css and php.\n\n\n**THANKS FOR THE HELP!**",

            "selftext": "Today I was approached by a couple of people who have an idea for a startup and they want a website prototype for the idea, due in 3 months from now. The website should (or must) represent the core functionality of the idea, and the idea needs information management from the users as well as some very simple matchmaking algorithm using the same information to pair up people.\n\nAs for myself, I'm a physics undergraduate who is proficient at programming, but by no means a fully trained developer. I mostly use programming for scientific purposes, but I have learned different technologies like building Android apps using Java and some simple Windows application building using C# along the way; I consider myself more than proficient in C, C++ and Python, although I have some simple knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and a little bit of Ruby. I also know my way around git and Linux.\n\nI would like to kindly ask what is the basic outline for developing a website of this kind. I know I must learn some database management (what framework?), back-end web development and also front-end, but because of my inexperience I don't know how to approach this. For example, let's say I choose Django given my knowledge of Python, how does it work for my purpose? How will I set up a server for the website? I think these are the questions everyone has when they want to build a website, but I would like to have an insight of what I would need to learn or do in order to stick to the project or not.",

I have always had a strong interest in the tech industry and wanted to get involved in an area that wasn't sales related (been doing sales the last 8 year). After a lot of reading, I found out that not only is it possible to enter the field as a developer without a comp sci degree ( i have 2 in lib arts), but there is a continuing demand not only in the US, but in Canada as well.\nI am 29 years old living just outside Toronto. I have already started taking a course which teaches you the basics of HTML, CSS, and a bit more of a heavier focus on JS. What I am wondering is there anyone currently in the Toronto area working as a developer, who can give me some advice on where best to focus my time and energy. Also, what is a realistic time frame to start applying for jobs if I am putting in 30+ hours a week of learning. Also, any recommendations on what kind of projects to take on for my portfolio?\nThanks everyone!",

I haven't been able to find very much informative information on properly handling a database and requests to fill a dynamic page.\n\nWhat is best practice when querying a database for multiple different tables? For instance, If want to show data from a \"On Order\" table and \"Current Inventory\" table. Either table can be anywhere from 0 to 1000+ records long. Would you always handle this with two separate get-requests (promises)? This is just a simple example and there could be up to 5 different promises made in the current iteration of the design.\n\n ",

I'm not talking about a business intelligence or data science use case, but more like insight into whether and how your intended engineering changes have had the right impact on how data moves through your application.\n\nWhere I work, we use several different tools to get insight into how our systems are working:\n\n- honeycomb to turn our nginx logs into structured, query-able and easy-to-visualize data\n- new relic for understanding overall throughput and tracking unexpected errors\n- signalfx when we want to capture specific metrics\n\nBut none of these quite gives me the same insight I get from bigquery. We ETL structured application data into bigquery, so what I can slice and dice there is similar in volume to raw requests, but the actual data has been transformed. The parts we tend to care about from a business logic perspective have been cherry-picked and sorted into the different bigquery tables by the ETL process.\n\nThat means bigquery becomes an invaluable tool for us to assess how any changes are impacting the data flowing through our system in the wild (in contrast to unit or integration testing that validates that the code works, but doesn't give you a rich profile of how the application is actually being hit).\n\nDoes anyone else use bigquery in a similar way?",

I'm at a point in my learning where I like to think I've gained a pretty solid grasp on HTML and CSS (as well as some frameworks like bootstrap). This, of course, is with the understanding that there is plenty more I can learn in these areas, but my understanding of Javascript... that is another story.\n\nLike I said I'm at a point in my learning where I've been chugging away at fundamental javascript and it's placed in front end web design. And while it's basic I do grasp the concept that Javascript adds interactivity to your websites and a whole lot more, but that's it... the whole lot more is where I'm struggling. \n\nWhen I tried to decide which Javascript framework to try and start learning I was engrossing myself in each of the big three to decide how to move forward (Angular, React, and Vue). Something that I (and again this could sound ignorant and be straight up wrong) cant seem to understand is where these frameworks come into place when creating the \"front end\" of the website. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tSFQQPvYtY\n\nVideos like this I notice the commentator stating and reiterating that it's not Vue or the Javascript framework that is creating the animations, page layout, cool effects, color schemes etc. but isnt that the \"Front End\" of the website?\n\nWhile I get that the \"paint\" and I guess \"skeleton\" of the website are going to be CSS and HTML respectably but then I guess it goes back to what is the Javascript used for and how do the frameworks come into play? I see so much feature talk in javascript frameworks about how they store data, can manipulate the DOM, and how they interact with API endpoints etc. but to me that all seems like stuff that would be more considered \"back end\" but again maybe I'm dead wrong. \n\nI guess what I'm looking for is an answer to these TLDR questions.\n\n-When and where do you exactly use javascript/javascript framework in your project? \n\n-What parts of the website or app are effected by what is written in the javascript framework?\n\n-are entire apps/sites coded entirely in these frameworks? or are just portions of the site or certain functions/interactivity made with the framework?\n\n-is my understanding of Front End vs Back End Fatally flawed?\n\nThanks and sorry for another all over the place question!

White screen while amp.js is loading (body is set to `visible:false` and there's no way to change that). Would make sense if amp allows you to set a splash screen of some sorts or whatever.\n2. All restrictions make developing this a pain.\n3. I really miss the ability to hook in custom scripts. I mean, I understand that more scripts add more load time, but why don't they make the minimum content to be loaded and displayed first, and provide a method to load scripts afterwards that can hook in and add functionality?\n4. Their minimum package (`v0.js`, then you can add more scripts if you need specific components) weights almost 70KB whereas jQuery (known to be a huge package) weights 33KB. Yes, it's a cache-able file, but it still takes 5 seconds on poor mobile connections to load, and the user is presented this stupid white screen meanwhile.\n\nSo the only benefit I see is for SEO, apparently when looking for a page from a mobile device in Google, having a page AMP-validaded gives a pretty good score to rank the results.\n\nAnyone has had a similar experience with this?

            "selftext": "This is probably one of the wierdest issues we had in a long time.\n\nWe wanted to make use of an page transition effect when a user submits a form or clicks on a link. This is useful in one of our current client applications since the requests take some time to collect the data.\n\nWe do the fadeIn animation on click/submit like this:\n\n    $(function() {\n      $('form').submit(function() {\n        $('#overlay').addClass('in');\n      });\n      $('a').click(function() {\n        $('#overlay').addClass('in');\n      });\n      $('a.delete').click(function() {\n        if(!confirm('Really?')) {\n          $('#overlay').removeClass('in');\n          return false;\n        }\n      });\n    });\n\nWhen a new page is loaded it plays the fadeout animation automatically. This works really well in all current browsers until we tried Safari.\n\nIt seems like the page freezes on click/submit.\n\nI posted it on Codepen and the bug disappeared. (WTH?!)\n\nFound out that if the same page is present in an iframe the same script/animation will run perfectly fine.\n\nHere is a test page of the bug:\n\nhttp://www.bt-it.de/prototypen/safari-bug/\n\nTo show the effect the page sleeps for 1 second before it responds. Otherwise the animation would be hardly visible.\n\nThe CSS and JS is the same for the page and the iframe. The fadeIn animation only plays in the iframe.\n\nBut it gets even better. When using the back button on Safari it will load the page from cache with the fadeOut animation happily playing. (O_o)\n\nThe following is our currently workaround without having to use the iframe. It uses requestAnimationFrame to delay the submit/click until the overlay animation class is present.\n\n    $(function() {\n      var timer;\n      var form;\n      var link;\n      var $overlay = $('#overlay');\n      $overlay.removeClass('in');\n      function canSubmit() {\n        if(!$overlay.hasClass('in')) {\n          $overlay.addClass('in');\n          timer = requestAnimationFrame(canSubmit);\n        } else {\n          cancelAnimationFrame(timer);\n          $(form).submit();\n        }\n      }\n      $('form').submit(function(e) {\n        if(!$overlay.hasClass('in')) {\n          form = this;\n          timer = requestAnimationFrame(canSubmit);\n          return false;\n        }\n      });\n      function canClick() {\n        if(!$overlay.hasClass('in')) {\n          $overlay.addClass('in');\n          timer = requestAnimationFrame(canClick);\n        } else {\n          cancelAnimationFrame(timer);\n          $(link).click();\n        }\n      }\n      $('a').click(function() {\n        if(!$overlay.hasClass('in')) {\n          link = this;\n          timer = requestAnimationFrame(canClick);\n          return false;\n        }\n        if($(this).hasClass('delete')) {\n          if(!confirm('Really?')) {\n            $overlay.removeClass('in');\n            return false;\n          }\n        }\n        location.href = this.href;\n      });\n    });\n\nThis approach does work on Safari.\n\nhttp://www.bt-it.de/prototypen/safari-bug/workaround.php\n\nBut there is another catch. The delayed blob animation in the center does not play at all. It is set to start a short time after the fadeIn has started. To fix the blob animation we need to start it right away.\n\nhttp://www.bt-it.de/prototypen/safari-bug/workaround2.php\n\nAre we missing something or is it just that quirky?\n\nOn that note it seems to be an iOS/macOS bug because we get the same issue on Chrome with iOS 10.3.3 and on Safari with macOS 10.12.6.",

I've been working as a web developer for around a year, by working I mean learning full-time.\n \n* [Version 3 Current Portfolio](https://tor020.github.io/)\n\n Uses bulma CSS\n\n* [Version 2](https://tor020.github.io/PortfolioRound2/)\n\n No CSS framework\n\n* [Version 1](https://tor020.github.io/BootstrapPort/)\n\n adapted from bootstrap 4 template\n\n**Really any feedback is appreciated.**\n\n I have a few general questions as well.\n \n1. Anyone have suggestions on how to leverage positive feedback from users? For example, I made, [this](https://tor020.github.io/Killing-Floor-2-Calculator/index.html) for a game community. It has a [steam guide page](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=920604286), and I wanted to know if it would be a good idea to screenshot positive comments, from the guide page or on Reddit and put them on my portfolio. My main question there is, would that make me more appealing to employers / Clients in a significant way? Or is it just more important to have paid work accolades.\n \n1. Is it worth it to mention somewhere that I've had a freelance client on my resume? I've only had one client, but it was paid and there was a contract, it wasn't a lot of money, the work was just fixing his bootstrap layout and building a navbar on his site, the website isn't live anymore, but I do have a copy of the contract. If I should mention that on my resume/portfolio, how should I go about doing it?\n \n1. Does the website / work history look good enough to realistically be applying for positions with good odds of getting one? Regardless of that, what should I do next to make myself more hirable given what is there?\n\n ex: more projects, more framework experience, contribute to open source or make more applications for communities.\n \n1. Is there anything I could do at the moment to make myself more appealing for remote positions?\n \nAgain, really any feedback is appreciated I just wanted to outline those questions too.\n \n Thanks",

I have already setup a repository on Github and every time I check in my code, CircleCI runs a build. So far so good, but I'm stuck at the deployment step.\n\n* How do I setup code deployment? Do I need another service, or can I do it from Github? I also created a Heroku account to see how it can help me.\n\n* After reading [here](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows) about the Git workflows, I thought the one that best suits my needs is the Gitflow workflow. Currently my **master** branch contains the latest versions of the source and build files. But, obviously, I only need the source files to be deployed in the root of the server. But I don't have any idea how to achieve that. Is it going to be done from Github? Is CircleCI going to move the source files somewhere after a successful build? Should I do that from a frontend tool (GruntJS)?\n\nAny help/advice is appreciated.\nThanks\n",

Inject JavaScript to the page? if so, how?) my team should take in order to check if the text entered in several form fields follows a set of rules. But the main roadblock here is that the website--to which we would like to add this set of rules for text entry--is not run/developed by my team. The only solution we can do is to do the client-side check and I'm wondering what solutions are available out there.\n\nThanks for all your suggestions/answers!",

            "selftext": "I've got a bootstrap based app, and all I want to do is stick the <footer> to the bottom of the page. But if the content is larger (scrollable page), then it should be bottom of the entire content. In other words, I don't want a `fixed` position footer because if the content of the page is larger, then it annoyingly hangs there hiding the content which goes at the behind. So, in this situation, it should go below that content. So, what I'm asking for is `absolute` positioned footer which always sticks to the bottom.\n\nI took the [top answer here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12239166/footer-at-bottom-of-page-or-content-whichever-is-lower), and as instructed, I created a main div wrapper and put everything in it, then ensured that it has 100% min-height, is relative positioned, and finally footer is absolute positioned (bottom:0px, left:0px).\n\nBut despite this, my footer is hovering in the middle of the page for some reason. Below is the css for footer and main-wrapper:\n\n\t#main-wrapper {\n\t\tposition: relative;\n\t\tmin-height: 100%; \n\t\theight:100%;\n\t\tpadding: 0 0 100px;\n\t}\n\n\tfooter#footer {\n\t\tposition: absolute;\n\t\tbottom: 0;\n\t\tleft: 0;\n\t\tmargin:0;\n\t\twidth: 100%;\n\t\tbackground-color: #006b96;\n\t\theight: 25px;\n\t\ttext-align: center;\n\t\tcolor: #CCC;\n\t}\n\n\nAnd here is how my main wrapper and footer are placed:\n\n      <div id=\"main-wrapper\">\n      <!--some bootstrap navs, etc.-->\n\t</div>\n\t<footer id='footer'>\n\t\t<p><strong>\u00a9 2017<a style=\"\" href=\"#\"> John Doe</a>, All rights reserved.</strong></p>\n\t</footer>\n    <!--some bootstrap div ends-->\n\n**edit**\n\nI also noticed that doing this works, but only on pages with little content. When the content starts to overgrow, the footer doesn't stick to the bottom, but just hovers there at the fixed bottom position:\n\n\thtml,body {\n\t\tposition:relative;\n\t\theight: 100%;\n\t\twidth:100%;\n\t\tmargin: 0;\n\t\tpadding: 0;\n\t}\n\n**edit**\n\n\nIt finally works (touchwood!) after I added an extra padding to the main wrapper which is equal to the footer's height:\n\n\t#main-wrapper {\n\t\tposition: relative;\n\t\tmin-height: 100%; \n\t\tpadding: 0 0 25px; /* HERE */\n\t\tmargin:0;\n\t}\n\nThis CSS world is really mysterious!",

It was suggested to me as I wanted one that was free or cheap and would allow me to upload files directly using filezilla rather than being stuck in a template like some of the others.\n\nHowever I have noticed facebook will block the default URL (I have a proper URL to replace it) thinking it is dangerous.\nIs there an issue with that host or is it simply that some people have done the wrong thing hosted on there so sites turned to blocking it?\nIf I replace the URL with my .com.au URL will it then work and not be blocked by stuff like facebook?\n\nAlso I have heard that Vistaprint does dodgy things like trying to hold onto your domain name if you leave them.  Should I expect any of this sort of behaviour from 000webhost?  \nIs there anything else I should be aware of regarding this web host?  \n\nAlso does anyone know of any good ad providers besides adsense for my website? \n\nThank you for your help\nRegards\nBirchmark",

I'm mostly doing Office stuff, but I'm also maintaining a website and a few tools for our team, so I'm doing quite a bit webdeveloping. Now most of our site is designed by a professional so I'm just doing the programming stuff, but in some cases I'll also pick some colors, etc. (mostly for internal tools).\n\nI was looking at several laptops, especially the HP EliteBook 840 G4 and the Lenovo T470. I really like the T470 but its sRGB coverage is only about 60 percent.\n\nWhat do you guys think: how bad is that for a webdev? I can't really find anything with good sRGB coverage that is as satisfying in other regards, so I need some advice whether that's a no-no or maybe doesn't matter as much?\n\nAny experience and thought is highly appreciated!\n\nCheers",

I've learned a lot!\n\nOk, so my actual invoice related questions:\n\n1) I mainly use Wordpress as a CMS and, as most of you know, if you want a quality theme, you'll need to spend money on it. So I was wondering how exactly to tackle this with regards to showing the client different themes after having received the requirements. Do I just buy several and hope the client buys one of them or do I buy it with the advance I received (25% of estimated price)?\n\n2) I'm terribly \"ashamed\" for asking for that 25% advance. Any tips on how to handle this? I'm guessing it stems for self-confidence issues of not being able to deliver, even though I've almost never failed to deliver. Except this one time but that was Google's \"fault\" for not allowing me to use one of their services anymore.\n\n\nThanks! :)",

But now that I've moved past my indie android dev days, I want to check out something else in my free time: full stack web dev.\n\nThing is, I'm not sure how to start. And by 'start' I mean I already know stuff like SASS/plain javascript/nodeJS/gulp, what I don't know is what to build.\n\nHow does one become an indie web dev? In Android, I had to compete against 2 million apps, but I still managed to get 10 million+ downloads for my own apps. In webdev, whatever idea I have, I google it and find it done dozens of times and in a much better way than what I had in mind.\n\nI've been toying with the idea of learning webdev for months, I just don't know how to get started in a new field without building something that will add some real value to the world, something that others might google up and genuinely find useful. This is how I learned android.\n\nI don't want to build things that have been built already, I don't want to build beginner projects or something. I'm an experienced developer, I know what it takes to push something to market and I'm having trouble figuring out how to do that in webdev. \n\nHow do you even become an indie web developer?

I'm checking to see if the service modified something on the page they generate or what...

            "selftext": "I am a moderately experienced web developer and I am making my own web application in my free time. I don't have any real business plans or anything but I still want a solid yet flexible tech stack. Learning is goal number 1 here so I want the app to be deploy-able at scale even though I probably won't go through with it. I am super conflicted about using Meteor JS. On one hand I don't want to have to re-invent the wheel in terms of accounts and the like. On the other hand I feel constrained by having my frontend and backend locked together. Here are some more detailed pros and cons:\n\n**Pros**\n\n1. **Rapid Development**: I am a single developer and Meteor allows for rapid development.\n1. **Easy Websockets**: When I do need websockets Meteor makes them super easy to set up. \n1. **Easy Accounts**: Meteor supports secure accounts right out of the box so I would not need to develop my own security strategy which is potentially risky. \n1. **Easy Mobile app deployment**: Meteor JS can make your website into a mobile app automatically and is built from the ground up to support this. Manually porting with ng-cordova or some other technology will take a lot more work.\n\n**Cons**\n\n1. **Inflexibility**: It is very hard to switch your tech stack with Meteor JS. The frontend and backend are inexorably linked. Without Meteor JS I could split my frontend layer, backend business layer, and database layer and swap them out as needed. I could also host them differently based on their different needs. \n1. **MongoDB is strongly encouraged**: I am not a huge fan of MongoDB. All of my data is SUPER relational so I feel like I am shaping my data in an unnatural way and losing out on a lot of the efficiency of SQL because of it (a lose lose situation). I know you can use SQL with Meteor but it is inconvenient and ruins some of the advantages of Meteor in the first place. Especially if you want to store user account information in SQL (which I do). \n1. **Public REST APIs**: Public REST APIs seem more cumbersome with Meteor JS. I know there is a way to do it but it seems less natural than creating a single API with a unified authentication strategy.\n1. **Too Many Websockets**: Websockets for everything seems like overkill. I know it has some serious optimizations here but I feel like this could get out of hand quickly if I am not careful about it. I am worried this will be costly on the backend. Chat would be the only feature I need with websockets. Of course Meteor has libraries for incremental loading but this still strikes me as less efficient. For example, having a websocket open for a user profile that is likely to change very rarely.  \n\nWhat do you all think? Do you have any pros and cons you want to add? Anything you want to say about the pros and cons I listed?",

I have learned java and C. I have never taken a webdev class and know nothing about it. I have however taken an introductory database and networking class, both were mostly theoretical with almost no coding.\n\nA family member wants to throw me a bone and has asked me to create a website for one of his clients. I explained to him that I have no education in this and he told me to do some research and figure out if i could learn or not.\n\nHe wants a site:\n1) that the client can use to bring up all his Health and Safety documents (~80 pages)\n2) that the clients ~250 employees can use to look up the ~50 different procedures for certain machinery, and then sign it/ check off that they read it etc and keep track of which employees signed what/when.\n3)Additionally he would like there to be QR codes on all the machinery so they could be taken right to the specific doc for the specific machinery. This must mean it has to be mobile friendly.\n\nHe currently uses a file cabinent for all of this and knows it would be more efficient online. It sounds like I would have to be writing the front end AND the database/backend.\n\nI'm coming to ask you if this is something that is creatable, starting from someone with no actual knowledge of webdevelopment. He wants it done in about 2-3 months.\nI have no idea in the steps and intricacies involved and how much work this would actually be to create which is why I am here. I also dont know about what sort of tools I have at my disposal to create this, how or where to host the site or server etc.\n\nAny insight is going to really help me out here, I don't want to tell him I cant do it because I'm scared of something i don't know, but I also do not want to tell him I will do it and then jump into something that I cannot do and waste his time. Figured i needed to ask people who actually know what they are talking about.\n\nThank you in advance.",

            "selftext": "I'm working on a lightweight data-binding library and I want to support syntax to create multiple DOM elements to reflect the state of a \"model\", an array of objects.\n\nThis is a feature we've seen from Angular to Vue, and it's really the bread and butter of frontend frameworks.\n\nRequirements:\n\n- Reordering the objects in the model should result in the elements being reordered to match.\n- Moving the elements should be enabled via a unique id field on the model. (This is how you distinguish changes to the data with changes to the order.)\n- I want to **guarantee** that if the unique id is present in the dom, the corresponding dom element will only be created once. (Simply removing and creating all elements every time the model changes is a simple approach, but stuff like event handlers, jQuery plugins etc. will get messed up if you delete and recreate a dom element.)\n- This should be an efficient procedure only needing to loop the model and dom once or twice.\n- This should be lightweight (or simplified so it can be lightweight). My goal of 50 lines is looking pretty naive right now. Prove me wrong?\n\nI think the best approach is to maintain an array of references to all currently present elements and then loop the model once, creating or moving existing elements into the correct order, then finally removing any old elements that are left behind that should no longer be present. \n\nBut there are problems:\n\n- If the first object in the model is deleted, the above approach would result in ALL dom elements needing to be moved once.\n- There is no guarantee that a \"small\" change to a massive model will result in a small change to the dom.\n- It seems, like, complicated, man, and this approach is more like 200 lines.\n\nPossible other approaches:\n\n- Just delete and recreate all dom elements every time the data changes, which is surprisingly performant up to hundreds of elements. It doesn't fit with the \"create once\" requirement, but whatever, it's way simpler.\n- Delete and create affected segments of the model.\n- Somehow extract the minimum number of \"actions\", e.g. move, create, delete, by comparing the current state to the new state, and then apply them to the dom one by one (I got no idea how to do this though haha).\n\nSolving this has turned into a kind of brain teaser exercise that appears simple but becomes more complicated the more you explore it. How would you do it? Could you do it in 50 lines or less?",

I'm a student developer with my university's Student Tech Committee, a group that appropriates funding to IT projects that enrich student learning environments (computer labs, VR equipment rentals, etc). We hear proposals throughout the academic year and vote to fund them - it's some ways it's similar to Shark Tank.\n\nThe current webapp has fallen into [technical bankruptcy](https://imgur.com/a/ovViD) - it was built using SQL query builders, HTML templates and raw DOM manipulation. The technical debt is so bad that read-only controllers are 800-900 lines long, and I have no way to debug errors due to no stack traces or logging. Our group is also demanding more complex interactions that require spreadsheets, data tables and query systems, and I determined rebuilding the site using a more robust system was necessary.\n\nI've built a new full-stack application using React and Redux. It uses Redux-Query to fetch and cache data from a REST api, making every request and mutation consistent and traceable. It supports a lot of complex interactions and features, such as dual-auth strategies for development and production, reporting major events and overexpenditures through Slack, excel-style budgeting tools and fairly complex data tools. The app is going into production at the end of this month.\n\n[Here's the repository](https://github.com/RcKeller/STF-Refresh) - you'll need some config files and API keys to run it locally (PM me if you're interested).\n\n[Some screenshots (Imgur)](https://imgur.com/a/za1Yt?grid)\n\nThis is my first time building something at this scale and I'm a fairly new developer, so I'd appreciate any feedback you guys have.

I'm not sure if all of them have proper channels set up to facilitate that (webpack sure does have a donation page) but if it comes to it almost anyone can declare a bounty to get existing issue(s) fixed or create even new ones. \n\nYou might ask how would I justify paying them out of my own pocket. Then why not ask your employer/client? \n\nYou're using a software for free! It would be considered stealing if it weren't for the kindness of authors to make it opensource. \n\nStart paying for opensource or watch it turn to shit and you have no right to complain! ",

I haven't been taking computer science classes since the start of junior high and I guess I'm just worried that I'd be hopelessly lost if I started now.\n\nI mean, web development is basically some kind of closely guarded secret society, right? It's all young kids who have been coding since before they could walk, and I just feel like I might be too old to get involved. Or I wouldn't have anything in common with them. Or they'd all be super highly achieving wunderkinds and I'd seem like a failure before I even started.\n\nAnd I've also heard that once you reach a certain age it becomes literally impossible to learn new things.

            "selftext": "Hey there!\n\nI have been a developer for about two years with following experience:\n\n* Database: SQL, MS-SQL, MySQL\n* Backend: .NET Framework API\n* Frontend: AngularJS\n\nI want to create a user based website with simple CMS (text and images). The basics are as follows:\n\n1. Users can use reddit/FB/... to log in and manage their content\n2. Content consists of text and images\n3. Guests and other users can read the texts and view the images\n\nPretty basic, I know. This project is mainly training for me to get away from the MS eco system (Azure, MSSQL, .NET). Within the MS eco system it seemed pretty clean... .NET for backend, Angular for Front-end, MS-SQL for DB.\n\nNow I can't decide and don't even have a clear overview over possible full stack solutions from DB to frontend.\n\nThe only restrictions are that I don't want to use Java and want to keep the number of different frameworks to as low as possible.\n\nAfter completing the project, I might consider making an app for it. Having this in mind, the backend should be completely separate from the front end, right? (i.e. API)\n\nBonus, if the technology stack does not use MVC, but a stateless architecture.\n\nEvery help is welcome. Also, if you want to participate in the project and learn with me / teach me, let me know via PM.\n\nWhat's your take on this?",

At various points I need to contact the server to update a camera, add a video to a particular camera, delete items, etc, in the database.\n\nMy question is regarding the order of initiating and displaying these updates to the user. Let's say the user adds a video. Here are two courses of action I can think of:\n\n* I wait for the success response from the server (containing the video which was just added), and update the view with that returned data. This is relatively slow as I need to wait for that HTTP response.\n\n* I immediately add the video to the view, which is lightning-fast. Only afterward do I send the data to the server, not caring how long it takes for a response since the user can already see the result of their action.\n\nAnother situation might be updating the name of a camera. Do I display that update before sending it, or send it and then display the result upon success?\n\nI guess this question is more broadly about keeping the client's data in step with the server's data. Should the client always mirror the server exactly or is it acceptable for the client to \"get ahead\" and let the server catch up later?\n\nIs one course always preferable over the other or is it context-dependent? I apologize for the many questions, but appreciate any help. This is something which I haven't been clear on for quite a while. \ud83e\udd14",

Orders will be in the 4-5 figures, and it's all B2B sales so done by invoice.\n* Ideally it needs to integrate with Xero, the accounting platform we use. So the invoice would automatically be raised in Xero (or use an app that can pass the invoice to Xero).\n\nIs this possible with anything like Shopify or Magento?

There are tons of places online to find definitions - I'm thinking about creating a concise, dev-edited (*you* update and upvote the definitions, *a la* Wikipedia) glossary of common coding terms. Definitions are going to be under 200 characters, with the goal of helping beginners understand *where a term fits into* the coding ecosystem, not how it works inside-and-out. \n\nFor example, as a beginner, you might want to know that *NPM helps you download and install packages and libraries useful for building Node apps through Terminal/CLI.* You can do your own, thorough research after that, but as a beginner, this helps answer the question of \"what the hell is this/should I learn this?\".\n\nThoughts?\n\n---\n\n**UPDATE**: Thanks for the overwhelmingly encouraging feedback and great suggestions, everyone! **I've started building the MVP** with a Node/Express/Mongo back-end and can fortunately commit to this full-time for a little while. I will keep everyone in the loop on how it goes, and will let you know as soon as we can welcome beta submissions and users. Please feel free to chime in with your product/feature ideas, as this whole project revolves around community participation!\n\nPS: I've never authored an open-source project before, so if anyone has any suggestions/tips, please reach out.",
