            "selftext": "Hi all!\n\nI'm hoping for some advice about swarm robotics simulation.\n\nI'd like to test some swarm robotics algorithms with highly simplified agents (ideally thousands) in a liquid environment. I'm imagining rigid spheres that can move by magically exerting a force on a liquid medium in an arbitrary direction. Fluid dynamics could be much simplified, but I think I would need viscosity just to keep things stable. Also I'd like the agents to be able to produce dilute substances that diffuse by Fick's Law (\"passive scalar transport\" seems to be what I want). \n\nIt looks like computational fluid dynamics libraries like OpenFOAM and Palabos can do this, but having any sort of moving solid object in the flow seems to lead down a rabbit hole of \"immersed boundary methods\". So far, immersed boundary methods sound like computational overkill for some simple rigid spheres, especially when I want lots of them, but perhaps it's the only way? \n\nThere's also robotics simulation software. ARGoS sounds promising with its pluggable physics engines, but there doesn't seem to be a fluid dynamics engine so far. Webots' website says they have a fluid dynamics engine, but it sounds like I would need to buy the pro version to have any control over it, and that's a lot of money.\n\nThanks for any advice you have!",

            "selftext": "Sorry for the wall of text. It all boils down to this: I believe I have been taking on far more responsibility than a single engineer (even a veteran engineer) should be able to reasonably accomplish, my bosses are frustrated with lack of progress, and I would like a reality check by people with experience in the area. Please read the wall of text below for details.\n\nFor the past ~1 year I have been working for a medium sized university full time under the title of \u201cMechatronics Design Engineer\u201d. I have a BS and MS in mechanical engineering, with a focus on robotics. I started this job right out of grad school. My official work experience other than my thesis research (which involved robot design/wiring/programming) is 3 co-op terms (two in a manufacturing engineer position and one at a major auto manufacturer where I programmed industrial robots). I consider myself a jack of most trades, but a master of none in most areas of robotics. I can code, I can wire, I can design. \n\nI was hired by a very small group of researchers at this university (2 people (a married couple in their 70s), one with an MS in electrical engineering, and one with a Ph.D in a biological field, who periodically hire students who help them and write their thesis on the work they did). They had been working on a technology they thought could revolutionize a certain field of medical care, which I believe is true. \n\nThey hired me to design a device that could implement this technology and ultimately for us to pass it through the FDA and bring it to market. They hired \u2013me- because in order to implement this technology successful, it must be fully automated in the form of a 7 degree of freedom robot. They were on a tight budget, and I had the skills to make it work. Seeing the potential of the new technology, and being na\u00efve to the difficulty of getting something passed through the FDA I readily accepted the job. \n\nOver the past year, I have been expected to single handedly bring this device into existence while my two bosses handled the managerial responsibilities (funding, market research, writing research papers, etc.). After about 9 months of my bosses pressuring me and lots of stress I created a working prototype (a ~900lb device). When I say single handedly, I mean I have done all of the following by myself in roughly chronological order: concept sketches, CAD modeling, ordering parts, machining/welding all custom parts by hand in the university machine shop, assembly, reworking, wiring the entire system, programming the device, testing, troubleshooting, and documentation of all of this. I have had to come up with creative solutions to numerous problems no one has ever had to address before and which seemed impossible, and somehow I made it all work. We have submitted patent applications for solutions I have come up with. \n\nAlong with all of this, I have been responsible for maintaining the documentation that is required by the FDA. To say it is a chore is an understatement. We did hire a company to consult us on this task who has provided us with document templates and who attempts to keep us on the right track to FDA approval. I have successfully lead two design reviews so far with investors and engineers in attendance. \n\nAt this point, we have successfully tested the device I have created on several human subjects, but it is very much a prototype. I made it work, but by no means is it up to the standards of the FDA in terms of IEC60601 and similar standards. Our next step is to re-design the machine to be compliant with all of the necessary standards, and submit it to the FDA. This seems like a near impossible task with our current budget and timeframe. (1 year from now)\n\nHere is the question I made this post to ask: Is too much being expected of me? Every engineer who has personally seen our device has told me that they could not believe I did all of this myself in the timeframe I had. These were all experts in their field, people who knew what they were talking about. In spite of this, the entire time I have been working on this project, my two bosses have had a constant heir of impatience and frustration directed towards me regarding apparent lack of progress, and failing to meet deadlines they had set far in the past, before I came on board. This phenomenon is amplified every time we get a reality check in the form of finding out there is a new obstacle we must overcome.\n\nA recent example of this was in the form of quotes we received from a handful of medical electrical device companies for outsourcing the design of the electronic controls/enclosure for the next iteration of the device to ensure FDA compliance. The quotes were in the ~$250,000-$500,000 range, which is way outside our budget for any one item like that. They have been pressuring me to do it myself, and express impatience and frustration with me when I tell them it is not something I can do successfully in the span of a couple months along with all of my other responsibilities designing pretty much every aspect of the next iteration of the device. I have never designed a custom PCB before, let alone to the standards of the FDA.\n\nTo try to summarize things, I feel like I have been doing the job of an entire team of engineers by myself, and fear that I will get blamed for not doing MORE if the project goes under, most likely due to us losing funding, and getting a bad review for my next job in spite of doing what I believe is far more than one person should have been able to accomplish all things considered. I have been giving this job 110% of my effort from start to finish. They are paying me $75,000/yr if it matters. Am I justified in feeling how I do, or am I unjustifiably playing the \u2018poor me\u2019 card? \n",

            "selftext": "I'm working on a motorized wheelchair design to provide mobility to a bunny that only has the capacity to move three out of four of her limbs. I've never worked with robotics or electronics before, but I am a software developer by trade and have no problem picking up new things. I'm looking for help in reviewing the design I have, as well as locating parts. Price isn't an issue, I'll be paying for the parts, and assembling whatever I need to myself.\n\n-=Silver, The Bunny=-\nHere's the Silver, the handicapable bunny that made me tear up (https://www.reddit.com/user/jennagadski is her caretaker). She's in a onesie to keep her diaper in place (she doesn't have any bowel control due to paralysis).\nhttps://i.redd.it/l0pbtlzu1noz.jpg\nhttps://i.redd.it/hc4b3qpi1noz.jpg\n\nOriginal posts\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Rabbits/comments/730mod/happy_bunny/\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Rabbits/comments/730m5k/clean_diaper_clean_clothes_and_a_belly_full_of/\n\n-=The Wheelchair=-\nHere's an image of the design I've put together. It's an augmentation to a non-motorized PVC-based sling wheelchair. \nhttps://i.imgur.com/LudDvb7.png\n\nMy questions are...\n1. Does this look like a reasonable design? Please criticize, you won't hurt my feelings. I've never done anything like this before.\n2. Has anyone used capacitive sensing with animal fur? Does it even work?\n3. Can someone recommend a power system for this thing? Preferably rechargable like a cell phone battery so it doesn't have an ongoing cost to the owner. I'd also like to hide everything electronic inside of the tubing so the bunny doesn't have access to it, so smaller is better.\n4. My biggest concern comes from getting the cam wheels working properly. I saw these for sale (and they looked good), but I don't think they articular left-right. Does anyone know of any motorized cam wheels that both turn left-right, and drive forward. I would strongly prefer to have the motor and wheel integrated so it's easier for me to get everything working together.\nhttp://www.robotshop.com/en/cytron-power-window-motors-w--5-wheels--pair.html?gclid=CjwKCAjwu7LOBRBZEiwAQtfbGBpdK51NIo17DDBo-X77xstyy9zJUGxaGM5tqzWBXOh4g8NSp5Tf-BoCVtMQAvD_BwE\n4a. If I can't find any motorized cam wheels that also turn left-right, what are my options? I was thinking about combining forward motion cam wheels, with a motor that could apply torque to twist them to get that left-right motion. Does that sound right?\n5. I would like this chair to have a top speed, and not go very fast even if the motors are capable of much more. After all it's going to be a bunny, not a person at the helm (though I don't expect Silver to be in her wheelchair unsupervised). I assume I can regulate this mainly by clamping voltage. Any ideas?\n6. For the safety of the bunny I was also thinking about a simple distance sensor angled downwards to keep her from going off an edge, and one facing forward to keep her from running into a wall. Either one of them would simply cut the power to the cam wheels if the distance values they got measured too low (too close to the wall) or too high (too much distance, a sharp drop must be in front of me).",

            "selftext": "Trying to make this short because im a rambler. So im currently on an undergraduate research project working with KUKA robots. I have ZERO background with programming or robotics except for what ive been \"learning\" for the past 2 weeks. The software we are using is RoboDK. My supervisor wants me to be able to hand write a simple code (in KRL, which I dont know either) to import directly into RoboDK. How can I do this? it does not take text files as i have been trying to write them in notepad and attempting to import directly. What software/program can i use to write a code that saves as a form of .src file or something compatible with RoboDK? *generating the program in RoboDK is not an option as we are trying to learn how to manually write the code* ",

I just moved to the San Francisco Area last year. I took a transfer from the midwest with the same position and company. I am currently only being paid about 70-80k/year, which seems extremely low to me as a BS EE with 4 years of work experience. To be more specific the device I work with utilizes mechanical, electrical, pneumatic, and robotic (a Denso 6-Joint Robot Arm) components to produce things in pharmacy clean-room environments. I mostly teach the pharmacy techs how to use the device, configure new consumables to be used in the device, troubleshoot/fix the device when there are problems, or install new devices or ECRs to improve the devices. I currently do not do any design work, and have not really done any since college. The work is OK and I believe it is making positive change in the world, but the pay is simply not good enough and I see no viable career path unless I get promoted into management. I am afraid I am painting myself into a corner... What do? Does anyone have some advice or ideas of careers I could easily transition to that have a more linear progression path and pay? Some have suggested manufacturing robotics, but I am unsure of the best way to transition or what other skills I may need to pick up. I am open to potentially moving, though I generally would prefer SF, LA, San Diego, Sacramento, Portland, Seattle, Philadelphia areas, and not to be in the Midwest in general unless the offer (Pay:Cost-of-living ratio) is stellar.

It also needs to have a good dynamic response, hence why we are considering BLDC motors. The application is for vibration suppression, similar to a gimbal stabilizer, except the mass is not at the center of rotation, and the gimbal/gearbox combo would be moving a moment arm. \n\nI was wondering if anyone had any experience with this, and whether or not the gearbox would ruin the response of the motor.\n\nThanks for any comments!",

I'd copy/modded it for delta robots, stewart platforms, zarplotter, traditional 3 axis cncs, etc.  It was getting too cumbersome to manage all that nearly-identical code in separate github repos, so I've brought them together into a single firmware that (I hope) is clearly separated by machine style and board type.  \n\nThe \"dev\" branch currently supports all these machines.  In the coming weeks I will be adding 4- 5- and 6-dof robot arms, kossel delta robots, and more.\n\nI hope this makes your life a little easier.

Not move at all just give a loud jitter noise for minutes, when suddenly one of them starts sweeping like a charm. Tried it many times, sonetimes it's the other motor but the same phenomena. Checked for contact issues and I presume it's not the case... I am cluless at this point. Do you have any advice? Thank you very much in advance!\n\nEdit: Whenever I swap the MG996R servo to a tiny SG90 is sweeps perfectly.

There are a lot of awesome programs like FIRST that are designed specifically to promote STEM for post-secondary, but the difficult is in identifying groups and activities that are inclusive for professionals, hobbyists, and the general public to take part in. For example, the programs linked to in the wiki of this subreddit currently all appear to be geared toward students. \n\nCan anyone recommend a good resource to start searching for inclusive programs?

I've done a tiny amount of embedded programming (Arduino, MSP430, still have both boards) but I want to take it to the next level. I have a few questions. \n\n1. ROS. Is this something that needs a kit or special hardware or anything? Can I run this on the boards I currently own?\n\n2. Everyone that I see recommends a robotics kit. Can I not just run ROS with servos and sensors and stuff that I wire up myself? What's the importance of the kit?\n\n3. Assuming a kit truly is the best way forward, is it going to be too easy? I got the Arduino when I was first learning embedded but I quickly grew out of it, it really shields you from learning the true nuts and bolts.

The students participate in a yearly robotics challenge known as the FIRST Robotics Competition. They work tirelessly each year to build and program a ~150lb robot to play in that year's game.\n\nThis past year we took up the challenge of adding ROS to our robot for control and we had some early success that we're now sharing with the larger community - just in time for ROSCon too! (I wish we were there presenting - perhaps next year).\n\nThe white paper is available as a PDF here: \nhttps://www.chiefdelphi.com/media/papers/download/5169\n\nThe code is available on GitHub here: \nhttps://github.com/FRC900/2017VisionCode\n\nZebravision 5.0 is a radical departure from previous paradigms of robot software architecture and completes the computer vision team\u2019s take over of team 900 on the whole :slightly_smiling_face: The work centered around the implementation of ROS or Robot Operating System into the team\u2019s overall software framework.\n\nThe main goal was to improve the facility of Jetson to RoboRio communication but ROS represents much more than that. This leap in software interfacing not only allows the two systems to communicate in a dynamic manner, but also lays the foundation for sophisticated control paradigms built upon the open source ROS framework. This distributed computation model will allow advanced work on robot sensor processing, motion planning, environment perception, localization, and mapping.\n\nThis is our work and we hope you all enjoy it!\n\nAs always, if you have any questions then we'll be answering them.

I currently have 0 robotics knowledge but I do have 4 years of programming experience (mainly OOP / concurrent Java stuff). \n\nI'm not aiming to get a career in the field but I find it very interesting, currently doing a udemy course where I am learning about analog electronics. I'm good with a soldering iron and have relative access to a 3D printer. Could any of you guys recommend a project for me? One with some resource that require you to learn rather than just following a step by step guide. \n\nThanks, Joe",

I did research in hydraulic wearable exoskeletons, actually not too bad to build an easy prototype.  In that project I had the same problem I am facing now.  I need a fast actuating shut of valve that can be controlled at a voltage that is reasonable, preferably 12vdc or lower.  If I need to go higher as per suggestions, I'm fine with wiring in parallel.  Im trying to get decently precise amounts of liquid into each glass.  Preferably something that is fairly easy to mount.  Any suggestions?",

Recently I find myself really interested and passionate in getting into the robotics companies which either building autonomous delivery robots or those robotics kits for kids education. I am considering to apply for a mechnic engineering master degree but I am not sure if this is possbile because I have an economics degree during underground. However I am good at math and physics. The main reason I want to get into robotics is because that I want to do something innovative, creative and at the same time create value to ppl's life. I beleive robotics can be huge to both consumer and enterprise markets in the recent future. Please let me know if anyone has any ideas or suggestions how I might be able to get into those fields with my current background? Thanks a lot! (or is there any school programs can open for adult students who have no robotics background whtatsoever but really want to learn for further career development and change?)",

I have a master's in ME and did a thesis on a robot that operates on voice command while also doing micro controller integration. \n\nOn one hand, I want to do design of novel robotic systems and start a career. A PhD would mean more years of low salary and less \"practical experience\". On the other hand, I have a 3.95 GPA, enjoy creating unique projects with real world applications, and believe I can do the PhD.\n\nDoes the PhD open more doors to R&D in robotics in the industry, or would the MS suffice? It seems like most job postings require experience with software (OpenCV, Fanuc, TensorFlow) and prefer experience, but I'm not sure.

It'll have two 7-DOF arms, RGBD camera sensor, omni-drive mobile base, extendable torso, run ubuntu 14.04 w/ ROS, and a bunch of other features.\n\nThe breakdown of the robot w/ CAD renderings is here: https://slaterobots.com/tr1\n\nSorry if there's not much information. I'm still tightening some things up, so I'll have a lot more information about the project by the end of October--including lots of videos.\n\nI'm really just interested in some high-level feedback on the concept. Would any of be you interested in a product like this? It's pretty expensive, but I think it has potential to be a really practical platform for building applications.\n\nThanks for your feedback!",

I am however, extremely interested and would like to pursue a career in autonomous robots, computer vision, machine learning, self-driving cars, factory 4.0, etc.\n\nI am considering a CDT Program (4 years of Masters + PhD) in autonomous intelligent systems and robotics in the UK at the Universities of Oxford, Bristol or Edinburgh. My question is, **would the market be as hot as it is now when I finish (2022)? Would there be a talent hunt in self-driving cars, production automation, drones, guidance, space robots, etc?**\nI would love to work on the forefront of some of these areas from an industry/company point of view or from an organization such as ESA.\n\nI am gutted I didn't move quicker earlier on in my career and switched, but I think a strong background in aerospace could also be interesting for a robotics career (space robots, rocket guidance...).\n\n**What do you think? Any advice? And any specific reading** I could do to gain more knowledge of these technologies (programming languages, AI, Machine learning, sensing...)?\n\nCheers",

The original design required a colour sensor but I only have a light sensor.\n\nI have changed SetSensorColorRed to SetSensorColorNone but nothing happening with the snare. I have checked readings from port view 2 and it changes from 30% to about 51% when pedal is pressed down. \n\n[original code] (https://pastebin.com/xP7Qh2uS)\n\nI'm sure it is an issue with coding logic. I am a beginner programmer. \n\nAny Ideas?\ufeff\n\nThank you.\n\nedit: Success!! Just needed to read a bit more and realize that function SetSensorColor is exclusively for a colour sensor changed it to SetSensorLight and with an adjustment on pedal to cover more of the sensor everything is now working correctly.",

But I've been wanting to get into the robotics industry since I was a kid and am finally trying to make the jump.\n\nI've already picked out a program and will likely transfer either next semester or next year depending on my acceptance. My questions is this:\n\nUntil I transfer into my robotics program (and potentially during), where should I work?\n\nI have very some experience with CAD and python. I understand I'm not likely to find a job willing to train me. But is there any poition I should be looking for? Some kind of entry level assistant position? Is there a specific type of institution to which I should be applying? \n\nMy apologies if I've broken some rule or if this is the wrong subreddit. This is my first post here.

So recently I decided to scrap business school and my safe goals of being some middle management lackey for a giant corporation I don't care about. I want to do something that matters to me. Basically I want to be involved with prolonging human life and having a helping hand in our evolution. Weird, I know but that's not my point. So it's a toss up between a few things but I'm wondering what degree would serve me best if I wanted to get into prosthetics or any type of human/mechanical augmentations.

I found a video where Quanzer demonstrates 3DOF gimbal actuation, but I cannot find an analogous product on their website. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmb1dta-dc0\n\nI am not too familiar with commercially available gimbals for filming purposes/quadcopters, etc, but thought perhaps this type of equipment could be adapted to serve as a spherical joint.\n\nUltimately, I would like to implement different control schemes on the 3DOF actuator, so I need to be able to communicate programmatically with the motors (PWM signals, or whatever they use). \n\nAnother option option is building my own device, which is possible, though I would like to avoid this if there's an existing product out there. \n\nAny input will be appreciated, thanks!

            "selftext": "I'm majoring in Computer Science because I want to get into robotics, and I'm taking an introductory course in computational thinking. While studying, I was wondering about machine learning and robots that are given a task and learn about themselves and give themselves their own instructions to complete the task. I realized that while this is impressive and a step closer to AI, it's not real artificial intelligence. I then realized that even in movies, robots such as the Terminator (specifically in T2) aren't real artificial intelligence either. The Terminator is a robot with the goal of protecting John Conner.  It learns from him, and eventually emulates human emotion, but even this doesn't make it a true AI. In the end, its goal is still to protect John Conner, and it destroys itself because it sees itself as a threat to his safety. It was at this point that I realized the dictionary definition of artificial intelligence is wrong. Artificial Intelligence is a program that imitates human intelligence. However, programs nowadays already do that to a primitive degree. What they have not imitated yet, is the human ability to set our own goals. \n\nA robot is a computer that receives input, and acts according to that input to achieve a certain task or tasks. \n\nAn artificially intelligent robot would be a computer that has the ability to set its own goals and act on them, and change its goals at its own discretion. Obviously we have yet to come close to a program that does this.\n\nThis is probably old news to most people, but it kind of blew my mind when I thought about it. \n\nWhat do you guys think about this idea of AI? Do you agree with it? Disagree? Let me hear your thoughts, this a subject I love discussing. \n\n",

            "selftext": "Hello! \n\nI have an IMU with 3-axial gyroscope and 3-axial accelerometer. According to the datasheet of the sensor (MPU-9150) and a quick test I\u2019ve performed, the axes of the gyro and the accelerometer are aligned. \n\nI attached this IMU to my index finger and recorded a dataset in which I repeatedly put the hand flat on the table and then raise it a bit and bend the fingers. I was trying to estimate the orientation of the IMU using Madgwick filter algorithm, but I was getting really strange results. \n\nhttps://imgur.com/jGFyGD9\n\nI tried with another IMU (same model) and also got quite unexpected outcome\n\nhttps://imgur.com/0cdMDSB\n\nTrying to understand what is going on, I\u2019ve looked at estimating the orientation of the IMU using just gyroscope or just accelerometer data and here\u2019s what I got:\n\nFor the first IMU:\nhttps://imgur.com/e6mrEuT\n\nFor the second IMU:\nhttps://imgur.com/l24PQgl\n\nThe gyroscope drift is HUGE! I mean, I was expecting some drift, but definitely not over 200 degrees in 2 minutes. I think it\u2019s seriously messing up with the algorithm\u2019s performance. Also why is this drift sinusoidal? Is that normal? Is there something I can do about this drift or may it be a hardware issue?\n\nAnother thing is why is the orientation estimation from gyro and from accelerometer no aligned it terms of the sign (it seems like the axes of one of the sensors should be flipped) although the axes of the sensors are for sure aligned?  \n\nCan anyone help me with understanding what\u2019s going on and how to fix it? Thank you in advance!\n\nP.S I should probably mention that prior to using the data, I have performed a simple calibration procedure based on [D. Tedaldi, A. Pretto and E. Menegatti, \"A Robust and Easy to Implement Method for IMU Calibration without External Equipments\", In: Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA 2014)]. The calibration pipeline requires the sensor to be moved by hand and placed in a set of different, static poses. At first the accelerometers are calibrated taking measurement samples in the static intervals. Then these results are exploited to calibrate the gyroscopes, employing a numerical integration technique.\nUsing the raw data yields very similar results though\u2026\n",

However, this field of work is draining. It's not difficult, just extremely tedious and unenjoyable. \n\nI was wondering if anyone had some resume advice for what I should focus on in this last semester of my studies? Currently, I'm teaching myself HTML to give myself more of a proficiency with coding. I know C++ and Matlab, so I feel weak in that area. Also, I have experience with Solidworks, so I'm going to be attempting to strengthen my CAD design over these next couple months to help out. My capstone was robotics based, so I hope that that helps, but I'm relatively unsure because I went to a small school that didn't have a whole lot of funding for massive robotics capstones.\n\n\nRight now, I don't know if I should attempt to go to grad school in the fall, search for robotics internships since I only have some minor experience in the field, or just stick it out at the firm I'm at to save up some cash and pay off my student loans while continuing to learn more languages.\n\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated.

            "selftext": "I'm interested in designing a boost converter using the TPS61021A chip from TI.\n\n\nData sheet: http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tps61021a.pdf\n\n\nOriginally, I wanted to build a Manhattan type dead bug prototype circuit by following the example circuit on page 12. I bought components off Mouser by going by the guidelines given in page 13-14.\n\n\nFor the inductor, I bought the exact Coilcraft inductor specified in the datasheet so there is no problem. But when it comes to capacitors and resistors, I calculated the values I need, but there are different types/power rating/mount type, and I don't think I bought the most suitable ones. Here are the ones I bought, along with labels corresponding to the components in the circuit on page 12:\n\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/NR5aMAP.jpg?1\n\n\nA few issues:\n1) R2: Notice how big R2 is. I believe this is because I bought one with too high of a power rating. This is definitely not suitable.\n2) R1: This looks like a typical resistor. Notice how it says \"metal film\" while R2 says \"metal oxide.\" For my application, does it matter what type of resistor to use?\n3) Capacitors: I believe I got X7R ceramic caps for all. Do you see any problems with the capacitors? There are no problems with the values. I also believe I took into account of capacitance derating under dc bias voltage. Notice the high voltage value for the capacitors on the bag.\n\n\nAnyway, those were purchased a month ago. Then I realized it's hard to make a dead bug style circuit since the IC chip in question is of the WSON package which is way too small for me to work with. I plan to make a PCB prototype. Are there places where I can send in the components and an Eagle file and they can prototype cheaply and quickly?\n\n\nThanks",

I can't seem to find any educator discounts for these kits. The library has 10 WeDo kits that for the most part work. I was just wanting to pick up 2 EV3 kits for the kids that really enjoy to seem to build things. \n\nThey work with 5-10 year olds, but the more advanced kids I wouldn't talking the library into doing an extra day for them. Maybe help these kids get into botball competition programs or something when they hit highschool. \n\nThe $350 or so for a kit is steep. My wife may kill me if I drop $700 on two kits for this. \n\nAnyone know if Lego offers Educator discounts? I can't seem to find anything.  \n\nkits: https://shop.lego.com/en-US/LEGO-MINDSTORMS-EV3-31313?p=31313&track=checkprice\n\n",
