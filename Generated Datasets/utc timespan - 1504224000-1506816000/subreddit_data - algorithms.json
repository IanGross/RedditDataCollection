            "selftext": "Hi, i came up with data structure that allows inserting keys in O(log n) amortized time, and lookup by key in O((log n)^2 ). \n\nAll you need is an array and some extra space that's at least half the array. It works like this:  \n\n### Inserting\n\nInsert keys at the end of the array but group them in blocks of size 2^k , when there are two such blocks of size 2^k merge them in increasing order to get a block of size 2^(k+1).  \ne.g: suppose you need to insert `1,5,3,4` in this order:  \no Insert 1: \n     \n     +--+\n     |1 |\n     +--+\no Insert 5:\n\n      +-+-+\n      |1|5|\n      +-+-+\nBut now you have two blocks of size 1, merge them:\n     \n      +----+\n      |1 5 |\n      +----+\no Insert 3:\n      \n       +-----+-+\n       | 1 5 |3|\n       +-----+-+\no Insert 4:\n\n       +----+-+-+      +------+------+     +----------+\n       |1 5 |3|4|   => |  1  5| 3  4 | =>  |  1 3 4 5 |\n       +----+-+-+      +------+------+     +----------+\n\nNotice that for 4 we had to do 2 merges: one betwen blocks of size 1, and one between blocks of size 2. \n\nIt can be seen that every 2^k insertions we have to do a merge between blocks of size 2^(k-1). The time complexity for merging two blocks of size n and m is `O(n+m)` obviously. So for n insertions we have the following complexity:\n\n     2 * n/2 + 4 * n/4 + 8  * n/8 + ... + 2^k n/2^k = n + ... + n = n * k = n * log2(n)\nThat is: an insertion is on average `O(log(n))` by the amortized analysis above.  \nTo decide when to merge two blocks it's enough to look at the base 2 expansion of n, no extra data structures are required. It's an array + space needed for merging, which is `n/2`. \n\n### Searching\n\nNote that at most there can be `k` blocks when `n = 1 + 2 + 4 + ... + 2^(k-1)`. To search apply binary search to each of the `k`blocks:\n\n`log2(1) + log2(2) + ... + log2(2^(k-1)) = 1 + 2 + ... + (k-1) = k*(k-1)/2` \n\nBut ` k = O(log2(n))`, therefore the number of comparisons is `O(log2(k)^2)`.\n\nI hope this is clear enough, i've implemented and benchmarked it against a red-black tree implementation i had. It is indeed faster for insertions because it only operates on an array, no pointers whatsoever. But the `log2(n)` extra factor for searching does make it slower than searching in a balanced tree.\n\nHowever its simplicity and low mem overhead makes it an attractive data structure for maintaing a dictionary.  \n\nDoes it have a name? Is there anywhere i can find more about it?",

All I know is that `R add(R a, R b)` and `R mul(R a, R b)` satisfies (if necessary, unitary) ring axioms (`e` is the multiplicative identity, `z` is the additive identity, `R inv(R a)` gives additive inverse).\n\nSay, I have two polynomials in `R[x]`, `P` and `Q`, represented as arrays (coefficient representation). \n\nMy attempt: I don't think this is possible. Every ring with characteristic 0 contains a homomorphic copy of `Z` but, in general this is not possible. So, it seems like this is impossible since we need a homomorphism `R` to `Z`. But there is only one homomorphism `Z` to `Z`. So, we need `R` to be an isomorphic copy of `Z`, which limits applications?\n\nQuestion: Is there a good algorithm to multiply two arrays in better than O(n^2) for structures other than `Z`?\n\nBetter Questions: What is the algebraic intuition behind FFT algorithm? Why do complex numbers (which is `Z[x]/(x^2 + 1)`) and integers interact like this? Can I do something similar by using other maximal ideals of `Z[x]` (or possibly even of other rings)?\n\n**Disclaimer**: I'm so sorry if my math is sloppy, I haven't done algebra for some time.

            "selftext": "So I recently stumbled across a game called [98 cards](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vdh.ninetyeight.android&hl=en) on the Google Play Store. After playing with it for a bit, I became interested on how to create an algorithm for solving the game. If you don't want to download the game, a description is as follows:\n\nThere is a deck with 98 cards, all numbered from 2 - 99. This is then shuffled and you are dealt 8 cards. On the table, there are four discard pile prompt cards are on the table: two showing \"1\" and an up arrow and two showing \"100\" and a down arrow. A player must play at least two cards from hand onto one or more discard piles, with cards on the 1 piles being placed in ascending order and cards on the 100 piles being placed in descending order. After playing two cards, you get dealt two more cards from the actual deck, still randomized, and continue on. One tricky aspect to play is that you can play a card exactly 10 higher/lower than the top card of a discard pile even when you would normally have to play in a descending/ascending order, e.g., if a 100 discard pile is topped with an 87, you can play any card lower than 87 or you can play the 97. Similarly, if a 1 discard pile is topped with 39, you can play 29 or any card higher than that.\n\nThe cards you get a randomized. How do you play to place the most amount of cards on the discard piles.\n\nI thought about using a greedy algorithm (even though there is luck involved) where, from the 8/7 cards you have you discard the most extreme ones (i.e, for the lower pile, you would discard 2 instead of a 5, and for a higher pile, you would discard a 98 instead of a 62. But, if you only had low numbered cards, you would discard 2, then 5 (in the 1 pile) rather than to discard, say, 39, to the 100 pile.). What do you guys think would be the optimal strategy/algorithm for this problem?\n\nEDIT: You can only play 2 cards. After 2 cards, you always go back to 8 cards (until the deck of cards to place runs out).",

Assuming I use a dictionary, I want to create a dictionary of size X and randomly assign each element with Y index values of the dictionary itself. \n\nMeaning I could take a dictionary of size 5, and assign each of those 5 elements with 2 index values ranging between 1-5.\n\nThe constraints would be that the index value can not be assigned to its own index, so the 2nd index can only be assigned values 1,3,4,5; And Y must always be less that X, in order to prevent assigning duplicate index values to the same index.\n\nWhat I have so far is being done with a list rather than a dictionary, but I'm not sure if this is the best method. I'd like to keep the algorithm running at 0(n) speed as well, even if the size of the list/dictionary is huge. Either way, this is where I'm at. \n\n\nSo, I make X a list of size 5. I set Y equal to 3, meaning I want each of those 5 elements to contain 3 index values. In the for-loop I create another list excluding the index value I'm currently assigning values to.  \n\n    X = range(5)[::1] # [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]\n    print(X)\n    Y = 3    \n    assigned = []\n\n    for k in range(0, len(X)):\t\n    \tXExcluded = [x for i,x in enumerate(X) if i!=k]   # if k==3 then [0, 1, 2, 4]\n        print(\"EXcluded: {}\" .format(XExcluded))\n    \t\n        assigned.append(list(random.sample(XExcluded, Y)))\n    \tprint(\"assigned: {}\" .format(assigned))\n\nSample Output:\n\n    [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]\n    EXcluded: [1, 2, 3, 4]\n    assigned: [[1, 2, 3]]\n    EXcluded: [0, 2, 3, 4]\n    assigned: [[1, 2, 3], [3, 2, 4]]\n    EXcluded: [0, 1, 3, 4]\n    assigned: [[1, 2, 3], [3, 2, 4], [3, 4, 1]]\n    EXcluded: [0, 1, 2, 4]\n    assigned: [[1, 2, 3], [3, 2, 4], [3, 4, 1], [0, 1, 2]]\n    EXcluded: [0, 1, 2, 3]\n    assigned: [[1, 2, 3], [3, 2, 4], [3, 4, 1], [0, 1, 2], [2, 3, 1]]\n\nOne thing I would really like to implement is someway to average out which index values are being assigned over time, because right now the algorithm may assign certain index values more than others. This may be more apparent when starting with smaller lists, but I'd imagine this wont be as much of a problem when starting with a very large list since it would allow the randomly sampled index values to better average out over time.",

            "selftext": "(I'm really not sure where to post this, since it's not really a question looking for a solution, I'm really just curious and looking for other peoples ideas)\n\nOk, so here's some background for this question:\n\nThe now-retired swedish strike aircraft [Saab 37 Viggen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saab_37_Viggen), used an Inertial Navigation System ([INS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertial_navigation_system)) for navigation as well as some weapons employment. The basics of how an INS works is fairly easy to understand, it's basically a continuous summation of accelerations in all directions, to put it simply, which is used to calculate your current position, based on a known starting point, and the sum of all your movements over time.\n\nAs you might guess, this makes it quite susceptible to drift over time, because the system has no real world references, and there's no such thing as a perfect inertial measurement. To correct this drift, they allowed pilots to input manual \"fixes\" where they would fly over a landmark and manually tell the flight computer \"I just flew over this point, adjust your understanding of position accordingly\". Pilots could also do this via the ground-mapping radar by putting a crosshair on a landmark visible on radar, this is essentially the exact same as the fly-over fix.\n\n\n**However, the part I find really intriguing is this:** The aircraft could automatically find and apply navigation fixes using a combination of the [radar altimeter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar_altimeter) (***NOT*** the ground mapping radar), and a height map of the operational area stored in the computer during mission planning.\n\nConsidering that the CK37 computer used in the aircraft was initially developed in the late 60's, it was very slow, and had extremely limited memory (I think ~25kByte *total*). Yet somehow, it could continuously and accurately determine your exact position (within a few meters), using ONLY your radar altitude directly below you as the input, by comparing it to a height map of the area.\n\nHow did it do this? Are there any algorithms or techniques that stand out as a potential solution to this? The clock speed of the computer was only ~2 Mhz, and it was obviously preoccupied doing a lot of other things too. Yet the updates occur frequently - in practise it could find a new fix every 10 seconds or so if the terrain was nuanced enough to give useful data. Completely flat terrain would give poor performance of course, since there's no pattern to detect.\n\nAs far as I understand from reading, the radar altitude was stored for a short while - basically it kept a short history of altitudes. But the data is basically 1-dimensional - it's just a short list of altitudes above ground (in meters), at a fixed interval. Like:\n\n    {192, 190, 183, 176, 189, 200, 210, 189} // etc\n\nAdditionally, the \"map\" of the area stored in the computer (in a small cartridge actually) was relatively low fidelity, the distance between measured points was relatively long.\n\nAny ideas?",

I've been having trouble implementing it in  C++ due to my limited experience in it. We are working with files that are around 100 million unsorted integers.\n\nWe can use any language, so I was wondering if I implemented it in node.js will its really take 5x to 10x longer?  I'm asking just because I don't have a lot of time to test and implement my self and don't want to go down that rabbit hole if it's not worth the trouble. Thanks for the feed back.\n\nedit: for those wondering I went with js using node for merge sort since I was having a problem with vectors in c++. I wrote bubble sort in c++.
