Then my question would be, what would be the most logical date to celebrate C's birthday? Is there some milestone or event that could be regarded as C's birthday?",

What I'm having trouble with is reading in the characters that are part of the crossword and not part of the words that I'm searching for.  I've tried a number of things, mainly looking for a '\\n' character so as to stop taking in input when I reach the end of the first line so that I know how big the word search will be. (It will always be N*N length with a maximum length of 50*50).  Also, I have to use a two-dimensional array for the input.  But the biggest hurdle that I need help with is getting the input stored into my two-dimensional array.

            "selftext": "I am currently attempting to program a basic BJ/21 simulator. I am starting with a simple HIT/STAND analyser for hard, soft, and pair totals. So far, it has been going good, until I have to move a node from Free to Player. The compute throws a SIGSEGV when trying to access Free via the transfer function, and for some reason, gdb shows that Free points to NULL, rather than a node from Shoe (for which I invoked before.) It seems Free does NOT receive a node from the Shoe list and for the life of me, I cannot find out why a node is not passed. \n\n\nThe object of the algorithm is to set up a Player/Dealer two card hand, test to see if any of the actors (that is Player or Dealer) has a two-card 21...or a natural as it is called. When neither possesses a natural, the program will then compute the EV for hitting standing based on the random drawn configurations of each Player/Dealer hand.\n\n\nIt begins by drawing Dealer to either Hard 17 (10, 7 as an example) or Soft 18 (11, 7 as another example.) After Dealer completes their draw hand, the program will then take the first node from the Shoe list and append it to Free. Free would be the 'free' card we use to compute a HIT. We will pass Player, Free, Dealer and the address of Strategy to compute the Expectation and the frequency of occurrence. STAND will be computed as Player, Dealer and the address of Strategy. \n\n\nAfter HIT/STAND have both been analysed, the program will then append the node in Free to the end of Player and as long as the Player total is less than 21, the do/while loop will continue.\n\n\nThe issue is the memory access violation that the computer throws when I dereference NULL, an action for which I do not explicitly command the system. Maybe better trained eyes can spot where I went astray.\n\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/anonymous/e00e36b8fea64db65bc9634d5ba16b1b",

            "selftext": "Hello, I've recently written a program for class that calculates the area of a trapezoid. Since my professor wants us to use PCFs, we've been trying to create them. Only thing is that each algorithmic step has to have it's own PCF so every printf or scanf statement must have it's own PCF. Now I wrote the base code and that compiled fine with no issues so I moved onto making the PCFs for the steps. For one of the steps where I have to input values, it doesn't work as intended.\n\nI input a value and it returns a value of 0.00 for the first variable - but the weird thing is that it takes my input and puts it in the second variable. It also appears that the calculation is messed up since that also displays 0.0\n\nHere's my updated code:\n\n    //Preprocessor directive to allow use of printf()\n    #include <stdio.h>\n\n    //Programmer-created function prototypes are below\n\n    void intro_msg (void) ;\n    void prompt_base1 (void) ;\n    float read_base1 (void) ;\n    void prompt_base2 (void);\n    float read_base2 (void);\n    void prompt_height (void);\n    float read_height (void);\n    float calc_area (float area, float base_1, float base_2, float height);\n    void display_results (float);\n    void outro_msg (void);\n\n    int main()\n    {\n        //LOCAL VARIABLES FOR MAIN ( ) ARE DECLARED BELOW\n\n        float base_1 = 0.0, base_2 = 0.0, height = 0.0, area = 0.0;\n\n        //STEP 1 - INFORM USER PURPOSE OF PROGRAM: THIS PROGRAM\n        //      CALCULATES THE AREA OF A TRAPEZOID (ACCOMPLISHED WITH A\n        //      PROGRAMMER-CREATED FUNCTION CALLED intro_msg ( ) )\n        intro_msg( );\n\n        //STEP 2 - PROMPT USER TO INPUT LENGTH OF TOP BASE\n        //      (ACCOMPLISHED WITH A PROGRAMMER-CREATED FUNCTION\n        //      CALLED prompt_base1( ) )\n        prompt_base1( );\n\n        //STEP 3 - READ USER INPUT FOR LENGTH OF TOP BASE\n        //      (ACCOMPLISHED WITH A PROGRAMMER-CREATED FUNCTION\n        //      CALLED read_base1( ) )\n        base_1 = read_base1( );\n\n\t //STEP 4 - PROMPT USER TO INPUT LENGTH OF BOTTOM BASE\n        //      (ACCOMPLISHED WITH A PROGRAMMER-CREATED FUNCTION\n        //      CALLED prompt_base2( ) )\n        prompt_base2( );\n\n        //STEP 5 - READ USER INPUT FOR LENGTH OF BOTTOM BASE\n        //      (ACCOMPLISHED WITH A PROGRAMMER-CREATED FUNCTION\n        //      CALLED read_base2( ) )\n        base_2 = read_base2( );\n\n        //STEP 6 - PROMPT USER TO INPUT HEIGHT OF TRAPEZOID\n        //      (ACCOMPLISHED WITH A PROGRAMMER-CREATED FUNCTION\n        //      CALLED prompt_height( ) )\n        prompt_height( );\n\n        //STEP 7 - READ USER INPUT FOR HEIGHT OF TRAPEZOID\n        //      (ACCOMPLISHED WITH A PROGRAMMER-CREATED FUNCTION\n        //      CALLED read_height( ) )\n        height = read_height( );\n\n        //STEP 8 - CALCULATE AREA OF TRAPEZOID\n        //      (ACCOMPLISHED WITH A PROGRAMMER-CREATED FUNCTION\n        //      CALLED calc_area( ) )\n        area = calc_area(area, base_1, base_2, height);\n\n        //STEP 9 - DISPLAY AREA OF TRAPEZOID\n        //      (ACCOMPLISHED WITH A PROGRAMMER-CREATED FUNCTION\n        //      CALLED display_results)\n        display_results (area);\n\n        //STEP 10 - SIGN OFF\n        //(ACCOMPLISHED WITH PROGRAMMER-CREATED FUNCTION CALLED outro_msg ( $\n        outro_msg( );\n\n        //STEP 11 - TERMINATE PROGRAM\n        return 0;\n\n    }\n\n    //Programmer-created function declarations are below\n\n    void intro_msg (void)\n    {\n        printf(\"\\n Hello, this program will calculate \\n\");\n        printf(\" the area of a trapezoid \\n\\n\");\n        return ;\n    }\n\n    void prompt_base1 (void)\n    {\n        printf(\"\\n Please enter length of top base: \\n\\n\");\n        return ;\n    }\n\n    float read_base1 (void)\n    {\n        float base_1 = 0.0;\n        scanf(\"%f\", &base_1);\n        return base_1;\n    }\n\n    void prompt_base2 (void)\n    {\n        printf(\"\\n Please enter length of bottom base: \\n \\n\");\n        return ;\n    }\n\n    float read_base2 (void)\n    {\n        float base_2 = 0.0;\n        scanf(\"%f\", &base_2);\n        return base_2;\n    }\n\n    void prompt_height (void)\n    {\n        printf(\"\\n Please enter height of trapezoid: \\n\\n\");\n        return ;\n    }\n\n    float read_height (void)\n    {\n        float height = 0.0;\n        scanf(\"%f\", &height);\n        return height;\n     }\n\n    float calc_area (float area, float base_1, float base_2, float height)\n    {\n        area = (base_1 + base_2) * height / 2 ;\n        return area;\n    }\n\n    void display_results (float area)\n    {\n        printf(\"\\n The area of the trapazoid is: %-2.2f \\n\" ,area);\n        return  ;\n\n    }\n\n    void outro_msg (void)\n    {\n        printf(\"\\n Hasta la Vista \\n\\n\");\n    }\n\n\n    \n\n\nAny help is appreciated",

The other option was creating functions `cloop` and `dloop`, but that functions would need too many arguments, and whenever I want to change something I would have to add even more arguments.\n\nI think that using a goto here makes the code more clear, you can immediatly see the purpose of the `if x`. I even added that useless comment so that people won't be too scared. If something goes wrong, [blame this guy at stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/9695942).\n\nSo, what do you think, is this an acceptable use case?

missing something fundamental\n\nI'd really appreciate if someone could look at my lrsll_popBack and lrsll_delete functions and let me know what I'm missing, I think I have far too many if checks in there to update the head and tail of the list but after watching the linked video several times and messing with double pointers I keep thinking I get it and then can't do it.  \n\nA review of the rest of the code would also be welcome but I'm still very new to C and I realise it's all a hot mess right now. \n\nMy code is below and also in github at

This byte might be written during operation before shutdown.\n\nWhat's the best way to manage these states? Would it make more sense to have....\n\n    //program.h\n    typedef struct states{\n        uint8_t STATE1 = 0x00;\n        uint8_t STATE2 = 0x01; \n        ........\n    };\n    extern const states mystates;\n\n\nor \n\n    //program.h\n    typedef enum states{STATE1 = 0, STATE2, ...};\n    extern states mystates;\n\nAnd then refer to that in program.c (and possible others that include program.h )? \n\nIt's pretty minor but neither of these seem like a fantastic way of doing this to me. Also is it safe to compare an enum type (which I believe is guaranteed to be of type int) to a uint8_t? \n\nBonus question: I've read that if you're going to have a global variable it's \"cleaner\" to declare it as\n\n    extern <type> foo\n\nin the header file and initialize\n\n    foo = 100;\n\nin the .c file. Why is this considered better style vs\n\n    extern <type> food = 100;\n\nin the header? Seems like if it's all in the header it's easier to track down and change the initial value if need be.",

Anyways, I need a hash table that will be updated only once a day, but accessed for lookup millions of times during the day.\n\nIn any other language I've used, this would just be a built in feature... or at least available in a well used / reviewed library. This doesn't seem to be the case with C (am I just looking in the wrong places?)\n\nAnyways, I'm curious what you would do to get this done. Do you write something from scratch? Do you copy and paste someone's 'solution'? Is there a good lib?\n\nThanks.",

            "selftext": "Hi everyone, I'm hoping someone with a better low-level understanding can help me out. I was playing with double pointers and went down the rabbit hole of understanding the memory allocations. Here's what I have\n\n    #include <stdio.h>\n    #include <malloc.h>\n\n    typedef struct test {\n        int i;\n        int j;\n    } test;\n\n    int main() {\n        test **testCollection = malloc(sizeof(test*)*5);\n        for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {\n            testCollection[i] = malloc(sizeof(test));\n            testCollection[i]->i = i;\n            testCollection[i]->j = i * -1;\n        }\n\n        fprintf(stdout, \"Size of struct=%lu, int=%lu, pointer=%lu\", (unsigned long)sizeof(test), (unsigned long)sizeof(int), (unsigned long)sizeof(test*));\n        for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {\n            fprintf(stdout, \"\\nTest struct %i contains i=%i, j=%i at memory address %p. The pointer is stored at memory address %p\", i, testCollection[i]->i, testCollection[i]->j, testCollection[i], &testCollection[i]);\n        }\n        return 0;\n    }\n\nThe output is below, I''m on a 64 bit system. \n\n    Size of struct=8, int=4, pointer=4\n    Test struct 0 contains i=0, j=0 at memory address 00511CB0. The pointer is stored at memory address 00511C90\n    Test struct 1 contains i=1, j=-1 at memory address 00511C00. The pointer is stored at memory address 00511C94\n    Test struct 2 contains i=2, j=-2 at memory address 00511C10. The pointer is stored at memory address 00511C98\n    Test struct 3 contains i=3, j=-3 at memory address 00511C20. The pointer is stored at memory address 00511C9C\n    Test struct 4 contains i=4, j=-4 at memory address 00511C30. The pointer is stored at memory address 00511CA0\n    Process finished with exit code 0\n\nOk so size of struct = 8 bytes. That's cool, sizeof int on my system is 4 bytes. Looks like it all lines up ok. The double pointers seem to line up with my expectations. Pointer size is 4 bytes and they are at 00511C90, 0511C94, etc...\n\nHowever my confusion is with the memory addresses of the structs (8 bytes). I would have thought that my addresses would be 00791CB0, 00791CB8, 00791C00, etc... where they are 8 bytes apart but instead they appear to be 16 bytes apart. Can anyone explain this?\n",
