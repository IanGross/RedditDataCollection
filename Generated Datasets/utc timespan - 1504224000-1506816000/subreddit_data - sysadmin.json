A client machine got corrupted and we decided on a reformat because it was still stuck on win 10 1511 and hadn't gotten updates in over a year. Upgrade assistant wouldn't let me keep anything so I decided just to backup andreformat.\n\nWe're a small shop so we don't have imaging in place although it's something we're currently looking into. Anyway, since I'm not on site and the computer is not connected to the DC anymore after the reformat, I figured I'd try to use offline domain join. It has gone fine up until actually trying to log into the affected account again. Predictably I'm getting a credentials error since I'm not on the organizations network or connected to the DC\n\nThe reason why I want to be on the Domain account and not a local account is so that the backed up files and program installs show under the correct profile.\n\nIs there any way to get this accomplished remotely? I know this seems like a very stupid question but it's kind of new territory to me. Short of that is the migration process of a local account to a domain account feasible? if that's the case, at least I can get the heavy lifting of reinstalling programs and stuff done on the local account.\n",

They have a document management system/software that allows a scanner user to scan documents into a private folder (\\\\SERVER\\Images\\Private) and to a regular folder(\\\\SERVER\\Images) . The way the permissions are set up is the scanner user has write and list folder contents permissions for the Private folder but not read. This was working fine on XP but is acting strange on Windows 10. No changes to the user, share or NTFS permissions were made. The user will scan a multi-page document but only the first page gets scanned in and then I get a \"unable to write\" error. I've been messing with the permissions with no joy and can't seem to find any good info with Google that has helped. It's Friday and maybe my brain is toast and I'm missing something simple...Anyway thank you for your time and help as always /r/sysadmin. \n\nTL;DR Switched to Windows 10 and now user can't scan to a network share like before. \n\n",

I called them Saturday at 1 to make sure someone was still on, and they said the tech was scheduled. Turns out they created a new billing number / account with the new circuit, never gave us the info, and then closed the ticket as \"new circuit created.\"**\n\nTuesday night: outage. My night tech calls it in. They schedule a tech for Wednesday morning.\n\nWednesday: AT&T tech is onsite all day and can't fix the problem. Other suites in the same building are online on AT&T Fiber, so the demuxer is definitely working, which means it's either the shitty gateway or the port on the demuxer. Still, at EOD, it's 24 hours hard down.\n\nThursday morning: AT&T support can't get it working. The same tech is there.\n\nThursday midday: AT&T decides \"fuck it, we'll move you to a new port on the demuxer.\" This also strips us of our 5 public IPs, which is completely unacceptable (remote workers, VPN, et cetera) - we'd have to roll an entirely new VPN package and deploy to 200+ users around the country. This is presented to us as the only option to get it up and running in a reasonable timeframe - they said it would take two weeks (!) to get a construction crew out to fix it.\n\nThursday night: I'm on premises updating the firewall with the new WAN IP information. The AT&T tech on-site confirms that everything is up and, after I specifically request it be put into IP passthrough, swears that the device is in full IP passthrough. I verify the connection's up, regenerate the VPN package, send it to the tier 1s for deployment when the users come in, and go home. 48 hours of hard-down on a business fiber connection. Joy.\n\nLater Thursday night: I try to get into the firewall from the office - and the fuckers didn't set the modem into IP passthrough, but left the firewall component on.\n\nFriday morning: I call AT&T support, scream at the voice-input-only IVR (fun fact: screaming \"FUCK YOU\" at it over and over will transfer you to Lubbock REALLY quickly). They attempt to get into their crappy gateway to convert it to full passthrough - and guess what, it can't be accessed remotely. I demand the first available appointment, and I'm told that they can't get anyone out before Saturday morning, 8 AM to 4 PM, no more specific than that.\n\nAt this point, it's 48 hours hard down and 60 soft, and at the least, it'll be 48 hard down and 84 soft before it's fixed fully.\n\nI'm furious - we've had a 48 hour outage due to their incompetence, and I'd simply bet that that some asshat gave away their IP block in the first place and reassigned it to another customer. I've had the client yelling at me, my bosses have been yelling at me, and I now have to burn a Saturday to clean up AT&T's fuckups.\n\nIf it weren't for the fact that GFiber isn't in that area (and the only other option is Spectrum coax, which has fucked that company over repeatedly in the past, and as a result, the owner refuses to get), I'd tell AT&T to go fuck itself. The only upside is that they went from 100 / 100 to 500 / 100 for $60 less a month, but I can't but think that AT&T is doing that either in a way to enrich themselves or to cover up the fuckup and our loss of the IP block that we've had for years.\n\nEDIT: Policy (not my policy!) was that the VPN was set up using the WAN IP address as the target. I'd rather a hostname and simply use an A record pointing to that, but I don't make policy, I just drink as a result of it.",

For me it was largely to go a consultant versus FTE, that eliminated a large portion of my stress and anxiety. (Now I just design the solution and make recommendations and let an implementation team handle the rest).\n\nOutside of work i have a variety of hobbies.\n\n2014 Ducati Diavel - My main interest, ride it to clients when i need to be onsite\n\n2005 Mustang GT - Project Car, building this into a Coyote 5.0 sleeper car for track/drag racing.\n\nGetting my kids into STEM related projects - i spend alot of time teaching my kids programming, and working with hardware so that they have an appreciation for the tech in the home and help flash start their passions (Currently building a Mame Cabinet with a RetroPie Build)\n\nTaking bike rides with my Great Dane in tow (Harder than i thought it would be lol)\n\nAlso recently took up Kayaking as it always interested me but was afraid to do it. The last two weekends we've been out on the Salt River (Me and my Wife). Last week was interesting as i got spun around on a rock and down in the drink i went with my cell phone. (We are going again tomorrow but i purchased some waterproof cell phone bags and got some awesome selfie sticks for our GoPro Hero Sessions complete with floats incase they get dropped.)\n\nAnyways, we all work hard, so i just wanted to see what everyone else does to burn off stress from the work.",

However, there's something that I'm not sure I understand which the page mentions:\n\n>DHCP in a Windows failover cluster. This option places the DHCP server in a cluster with an additional server configured with the DHCP service that assumes the load if the primary DHCP server fails. **The clustering deployment option uses a single shared storage.** This makes the storage a single point of failure, and requires additional investment in redundancy for storage. In addition, clustering involves relatively complex setup and maintenance.\n\nI've bolded the part that confuses me. In the demo, both servers have their own storage. At no point, was I asked about pointing DHCP to a different fileshare to save its config/db. Any idea, what they are referring to when they say single shared storage?\n\nAlso, has anyone set up DHCP Failover in Windows Server 21012 or higher? Any gotchas or things to be aware about?",

I compared the Root Hints (checked to use them) and it appears one or two are missing when checked at rs.internic.net\n * I do seem to have a large amount of ports for dns.exe after doing a netstat, but thought that might be normal. \n\n * Going through the DNS log, I do get some SERVFAIL on some internal items and some external lookups. \n * I don't see anything in the DNS Event Log, just informational.\nAny ideas are greatly appreciated on this Read Only Friday.",

We use them with our VMWare virtual servers, via an iSCSI connection within each respective guest. They cost around 40k each when we bought them. These have been very reliable for us over the past few years, but lately we've noticed our software slowing down. \n\nBasically, we want to add some flash storage to the mix to speed things up. We have reached out to Dell and HP about getting a quote, and the cheapest option was like $160,000. Which is ridiculous, we don't have that kind of capital on hand. Nor do we really need the kind of performance (or capacity) that kind of device would provide. We're not a web hosting company or anything like that, we just need our local databases and servers to respond a bit faster.\n\nMy questions:\n\n* Is there a cost effective option for us to get 10-20tb of enterprise network flash storage? Any recommendations?\n\n* Is it best to do some sort of Hybrid option? Or would a smaller purely-flash box be better?\n\n* Would it be worth it to upgrade to 10gig between our servers for this? Or would gigabit do? How does this affect cost?\n\nThank you!\n\n",

So tuesday I was out of the office, no voicemail or call from Comcast. Wednesday rolls around, still no call by mid-afternoon. Call them, get a note put in the ticket and get told it'll be witihin 24 hours. Okay fine.  \n\nOnto Thursday, I call since I haven't heard back and Tier 1 puts another note in the ticket and I get told the same thing \"You'll receive a call back within 24 hours from our Tier 2 team.\" Okay fine. At this point I'm pretty agitated at Comcast because I'm just trying to get this issue resolved for my customer.  \n\nSo today rolls around and guess what? **STILL HAVEN'T HEARD FROM TIER 2...**so I call them. I get told that Tier 2 hasn't updated the ticket, let alone look at it. Tier 1 tells me that they have no way of contacting the Tier 2 escalation team, okay so let me speak to a supervisor. Well the supervisor says they have no way of contacting Tier 2 which I think is a load of shit.

At this point we're using google forms and sheets to track help requests because the teachers are having a hard time adopting Helpdesk.\n\nI've had some experience with Connectwise Automate as a helpdesk solution/automation tool and thought it might clean up some other issues we've had in the district with our patching utilities, but it ends up being quite a bit more expensive than the services we would be canceling to adopt it, and it doesn't do image deployment so it's hard to justify as a replacement for everything.\n\nI'm not sure what else is out there, and I know this is less of a \"sysadmin\" question, but that y'all also see a lot more utilities and probably have had more real world experience with a lot of them. \n\nThanks!\n\nTLDR: We've looked at a handful of ticketing solutions and have resigned ourselves to google forms and sheets for our small tech team. We're having troubles with inventory integration and are considering migrating that with our helpdesk.

I recognize that there is a \"What X Service is Best for Y\" every month, I did do a brief search and checked out some of the other help desk information topics but wasn't seeing much about inventory integration, mostly just people being like \"I really like X service...\" and was looking for a bit more detail.

It seems there have been advances in print services and there is now Type 4 drivers. This seems to be a forward upgrade strategy and really focused on Windows 8 and newer clients. \n\nWe have a mixed bag of Windows 10 and Windows 7 Clients. In Windows 7 When you connect to a new type 4 printer driver share, it will install a generic microsoft point and print driver which is limited in functionality. I could install an older version of a PCL 5e driver and it will download and install the correct driver on the Windows 7 machine, but I worry about crashes, printing performance etc. \n\nI was just wondering what other people do and if they have a the same layout. I like the idea of keeping server 2016 as the new print/file server because we will eventually all be on Windows 10 and I know Server 2016 would compliment it well. \n\nSomething that just occured to me is I could create a legacy printer share for those users with Windows 7 and have one with an updated driver for the Windows 10 Machines. \n\nYour feedback is appreciated. \n\nThanks.

Writing that I suddenly feel far less qualified than my day-to-day experience suggests - in my last job I had to keep taking over from our MSP because I knew what I was doing better than they did, and in my current job I seem to know more about IT and infrastructure now than our old Technical Director did. May say more about them than about me though.\n\nNo certs, but I do have a decent degree in a technical field (certs are on my to-do list, but just haven't found the time to commit yet). My experience is 90% Windows desktop and server, with a little Linux server and some networking, web, etc, thrown in.\n\nBoth my bosses have been really good at paying people as little as they can get away with (and my current industry is notoriously low-paying), so I'm convinced I can do better for myself. I've managed to do everything asked of me in both roles, but I really want to move somewhere I can actually get some training/mentoring, and not have to figure out everything myself (thank you, /r/sysadmin) and make up standards as I go.\n\nThe only job I've applied to recently is around \u00a340k plus ridiculous bonuses at a hedge fund, but obviously that's going to be an extreme outlier from people with far too much money.\n\nCan anyone give pointers or suggestions as to what compensation I should be looking for in my next role?",

My coworker wants to deploy it to one user, wait 2-3 days, and then deploy it to that entire department afterwards.\n\nI'm worried about this, because I have to constantly check after deployments to see if everything is OK, and I would hate to drop the ball and then the next day there are X number of users who can't even do anything.\n\nWhat do you expect of your coworkers when dealing with deployments of this type?

            "selftext": "My IT career is almost a decade long now.  All of my positions have been at MSPs, and I've genuinely loved my work.  Obviously there are always ups and downs with any position, but something has changed recently.  I don't know if it's me or the work, but the end result is something resembling burnout.\n\nMy first company took a chance on me because I knew some people; I had no college degree, no certifications, and no experience.  I was paid a relatively meager starting wage (upper 20k's), but gained a crazy amount of experience in the time there.  I was laid off after a few years, and after a small stretch landed on my feet at another MSP.  This new one serviced enterprise-level clients, and exposed me to a whole lot more than the previous job.  I gained some certifications, rose quickly, and really matured into what I would call a \"sysadmin.\"\n\nEventually, burnout occurred.  I wasn't convinced that it was the work at that time, as the MSP I was working for started grinding everyone up.  I wasn't the only one working long weeks and getting angry about it, but I was the first to blow up about it and quit.  The work was fine, but the volume of it was crushing, and there were loads of empty promises that went unfulfilled for months.  When I finally put my foot down and said I was leaving, they counter-offered with a huge raise and I declined it.  I also don't regret it; I value quality of life and mental health over money, every day of the week.\n\nSo now I'm at a new MSP, and at first everything was pretty great.  Though I think almost anything would have been great compared to the last place.  I settled into a bit of an account management role, while still being an escalation point for the service desk.  It was a good balance between predictable and unpredictable work.\n\nHowever, the company has started a transformation.  Without being specific, they are becoming very metrics-based, and very rigid about \"roles\" and \"separation.\"  Part of that is sending people onsite regularly to managed clients for proactive administration.  I actually very much believe in this work, as we're providing a service that all places want to but few places make time for.  However, I'm now one of those people that is on-site all the time.  That in itself would be fine, but I still wear all my other hats.  The rigid role separation applies to everyone but me and a couple others.\n\nIf I were to make my own job title, it would (tongue-in-cheek) be the following:\n\nAccount Manager/Proactive Systems Engineer/Sr. Systems Engineer/Project Oversight Engineer/Mentor/Service Desk Engineer\n\nThe proactive administration has really served to find the sins of our project and onboarding teams (which is super-valuable).  I'm often on-site all day, but no one took the responsibility from me to answer client questions, so I'm checking and responding to emails at least an hour or more a day, while onsite at a client.  In addition I'm writing reports about mishandled projects, still the primary point of contact with a dozen clients, still get a dozen escalation questions a day, and get frowny-faces from co-workers and clients alike if I take too long to respond.\n\nThen, on the days I'm actually in the office, I still help answer the service desk phones, still am a coach for the whole department regarding ticket processing, still take the lead in framing and refining our best practices and documentation, and help spoon-feed our sales department so they get the quotes right (because they won't if you don't include every single little thing).\n\nAll the while I have among the best (if not the best) billable rate in operations, and am the closest to perfect in my time sheet accuracy (which is a big deal now that we're all metrics-based).\n\nI need to finish my MCSA for Server 2012, but I have not had the heart to study a lick.  I've had my test date scheduled, but have pushed it six months in a row now because every time I come home, I'm mentally exhausted and even anguished at times.\n\nThere's the part of me that thinks this is just weakness or laziness, but now that I type it all out, I'm plainly burning (or burnt) out not necessarily by the volume of work, but by the breadth of responsibility I've been given or taken on.  I'll fully cop to the fact that I willingly took a lot of this on, and I'm bad at saying \"no.\"\n\nAll the while, I've been with this company for going on 3 years and have received a single 4.5% raise.  I also think I'm a bit underpaid overall, based on experience and location.  I know my lack of a college degree or even formal certification hurts my pay ceiling (and the area I'm in, essentially a suburb, won't lend itself to the highest salaries), but I'm confident in saying I'm among the best all-around engineers in this company.  Anyone who might have more experience or knowledge than me is lessened by poor documentation, poor communication, or just unreliability.  I'm not afraid to say that I am a rock to be relied upon and the glue that holds things together.\n\nI don't know what kind of advice or repsonse I'm looking for, but I've been feeling this for quite a while, and would like to know if anyone else has had this kind of situation.  I'm not hell-bent on leaving this company, but I may demand some level of change either in my responsibilities or pay (preferably both).  I feel the resentment and pessimism creep into my communication with coworkers and bosses in subtle ways, and I absolutely hate it because I'm normally a very optimistic and upbeat person.  I love the people I work with, and they're starting to see a real unhappy dude with rising blood pressure.",

            "selftext": "All, \n\nHoping to get some input/ideas on this issue before diving in this weekend.\n\nBackground story: A few months ago, we completed a fileserver migration from Windows to FreeNAS+CIFS, no problem. After that, we migrated to a new domain (clean environment, yay!) using SetACL (https://helgeklein.com/setacl/) on the new fileserver. No real problems there.\n\nNow for the issues: \n-Every Monday morning, members of one security group can't access one SMB share on the server. The other shares they have access to, including the public (open to domain users) and their home share work fine.\n-One user's home share (not associated with the other department's security group) won't map. \n\nI believe something is timing out over the weekend, presumably between AD and FreeNAS. A reboot of the NAS fixes the problem until the next Monday. \n\nNAS Setup:\n-The NAS is joined to the domain\n-AD service checking is enabled on the NAS, no issues reported there\n-AD timeout has been increased, no change in problem\n-I've adjusted the SMB minimum and maximum protocol on the NAS, no change in problem. Currently the minimum is SMB2 and max is SMB 3_11\n-I've been through the syslog, Samba4, and Winbind logs. Logging level is turned up to full, one step below debug. Nothing apparent causing the issue there. \n\nAD Setup:\n-The malfunctioning security group is identical to all the others.\n-The user with the home drive issue is identical to all the others. I have reset ACLs on her folder, deleted and recreated, and now let AD create a brand new folder. No change. Planning to delete and recreate her profile next.\n-The user with the home drive issue now has the wait for network at logon GPO enabled. No change. \n\nWindows reported errors vary, but it usually reports a permissions issue.\n\nDue to the intermittent nature and scale of the issue, troubleshooting it has been a pain in the ass. I'm coming in Sunday (hopefully the timeout occurs by then) so I can do some uninterrupted troubleshooting without the pressure of getting it online ASAP (the quick fix, a reboot). I'll edit with more details as I think about them. Any ideas or suggestions? \n\nAnything helps, thanks!  \n       \n       \n        \n\n\nEdit: Finally found the issue after a rebuild. The only shares that were having issues were the \"open\" ones authenticating via the Domain Users group. Standard security groups work fine. freenas-debug and other utilities show the group/translated sid. Maybe it has something to do with the scope or some underlying difference between the builtin groups and manually created ones, who knows. Either way, creating a security group for all relevant users and replacing \"domain users\" in the Windows share ACLs with the new group worked.",

I'm doing that with the hopes that I'll be able to open and edit an .FDM file that I found and can't seem to open with the built in designer functions in Outlook 2016. I'm hoping to not start from scratch with the form.\n\nWhat I want to know is, how stupid is this? The way of doing this is so old that I'm worried a newer version of Outlook will be released and no longer support the feature of forms in public folders. And I know public folders aren't really recommended or En Vogue lately. But it's what they want. I just don't want to steer them down a bad path for me or them. What is the good path. (Short of jumping into the boondoggle of Sharepoint) Can you offer some guidance? What is the best practice modern replacement for this old technology?",

When users log in for the first time (with their accounts in the new domain, which have been synced over with MMAD, except for the HomeDirectory and ProfilePath attributes) on their newly migrated workstations, their U:\\ (user) drive (AD User HomeDirectory attribute), which is a file share on the file server in the old domain. I've mapped all the HomeDirectory paths to DFS in the new domain, which just points at the Users share in the old domain.\n\nWe have both Roaming Profiles and Folder Redirection enabled in GPO. Folder redirection redirects Documents/Pictures/Music/Videos to that U:\\ drive share (technically, to %HOMESHARE%%HOMEPATH%).\n\nThe first few batches of workstations I moved didn't have this  issue of their User folder getting deleted, but they did all get an error about their roaming profile not being accessible and so the cached local profile was being used. I fixed that issue yesterday by enabling a GPO, Computer Configuration/Administrative Templates/System/User Profiles/Do not check for user ownership of Roaming Profile folders ([this issue](https://support.quest.com/migration-manager-for-ad/kb/27571)). I also just yesterday realize the HomeDirectory and ProfilePath AD User attributes (in the new domain) hadn't been updated by the Quest software and still had the DFS share in the old domain, so I fixed that on all of them with PowerShell. Those are the only things that have really changed, but this morning, every single person I migrated last night had to have their User folders restored from backup.\n\nAnyone have any ideas?",

On their PoS terminals (Optiplex 3020s running Win7; domain joined), files randomly end up being deleted, which impede the function of the PoS software. We have copies of those files in a server folder and I wrote a batch script to copy them back into place, but the list strangely seems to be growing, and I don't know why.\n\nMy first guess was \"the antivirus program\". Checked the logs, no entries. Moreover, this seems to be happening at random times, on random machines (there are six; it's happened on all of them at one time or another), rather than scheduled scans or when the file is accessed. Hard disk scans come back fine.\n\nThus, it seems that the best avenue of resort is to get some sort of logging going to see when the files get deleted.\n\nThank you for your thoughts!",

In addition to the down time, we also received a botched IP address from them that has us on a few spam filters for email.  \n  \nI've been talking with my bosses to determine the best course and I have been tasked with migrating the server over to a different platform. After doing some research on a few cloud based solutions I believe that azure will be the best bet. It also helps that we have tech soup, and are eligible for 5k/year through them.    \n  \nSo, I unfortunately do not have the time left from in my other duties to accomplish this goal. I haven't really dealt with Azure much either. So, I feel it would be best to hire the task out to a vendor.

Kept saying update sources not found or error connecting. Nothing has changed with the firewall to my knowledge and this is a secure environment so changes are tracked hardcore. I talked with Kaspersky support and they swear up and down its FW related.\n\nThe setup (that has always been working) is creating an address group with an address for each Kaspersky download server then allow our kaspersky server to pull updates from the server with a policy set up to allow http traffic to be pulled. We also have a conditional forwarder in place on the DC so it will resolve using our environment that hits the internet. From here I'm not positive where to check with the FW to troubleshoot further.\n\nAny help would be appreciated, just let me know if i need to explain better. Thanks",

If I enter the username and password in for 5 attempts, it connects to the RDS server and tells me the account has been locked due to too many bad passwords.

The affected workstation is not able to process logins normally with ANY user accounts, so I know the user/password credentials are not the issue.\n\nThe problem appears to be related to the way in which the workstation sends the credentials to the RDS server, but I have no idea where to start looking for this issue.

Then it asks if I want it to auto create the snipe DB user password. I say no and enter the one I want. So far, so good.\n\nThen, right after it says \"MySQL Phase next.\" it prompts me to \"Enter password for user root:\" \n\nI've tried the password for my \"administrator\" account. I've tried the password for the snipe DB. I've tried the root password for MySQL that I set during OS install. I've tried first running \"sudo su -\" to get a shell running as root before running the install.sh . I've even tried setting the root password using sudo passwd root before running install.sh and providing the actual root password for the box. \n\nEvery time without fail I get \"Error: Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost' (using password: YES)\" , or in rare cases I get it just sitting there blinking a cursor at me.\n\nIf it gives me Access Denied the installer just continues with \"Creating MySql Database and User\" where it asks for my MySQL root password, but I don't know what broke in that step where it didn't accept my password.\n\nIf it just blinks at me I can hit enter a half dozen or so times, then it seems to suddenly jump to the bottom of the installer with a whole bunch of questions having been answered with their defaults. \n\nI've tried the install multiple times and I'm just not sure where I'm going wrong. Which root password is it looking for, and why won't it accept anything I'm putting in?\n\nI'm not too bad with Ubuntu/Linux but it's definitely a secondary skill for me. The vast majority of my environment is Microsoft-based. So that's why I opted for the pre-rolled install script instead of a manual install. Sorry if I've missed anything really small or obvious.",

Me (SysAdmin) and our SysEngineer are very impressed with Storage Spaces Direct + HyperV 2016 fir a hyper-converged environment.  Our director needs some persuasion on reliability of S2D for this environment.  He has concerns since it's Microsoft's software and the track record MS has with breaking things via updates.\n\nEngineer and I have researched S2D and have seen the pros of using SMB3 vs iSCSI with a traditional SAN.  We just need to really find someone who is using this in an environment and get some feedback.  We are looking to do 9 hosts, each with NVMe, some SSD, most 15K SAS, and few NL SAS drives to give us what we need.  Each host will have 6x 10GB NICs and 768GB RAM.  This will give us about 6TB of Fast Cache, and 100TB+ of datastore with really fast storage.\n\nAny experience in production would be great. We are building a test environment in the next few days to play with.\n\nEdit: To those who crap on MS updates, we will have 2 node redundancy, so we will be able to update one node, test, roll back if we need to and be safe.  If a second node goes down during this, things will still be fine.  We don't see the need to pay for extra hardware, extra software licensing and use more power for equipment and cooling if we can accomplish the same thing or better via S2D.  SMB kills iSCSI throughput in everything I can find, so I just want to see if anyone is using S2D in an environment of our size.",

So it's fallen in my lap to manage this. At home I play with ubuntu Plex server, Unifi APs, and other \"homelab\" type stuff, but I'm **not** trained at any of this. \n\n#Basics\n\n* Small office / warehouse and we're moving sites to a different town - so we need a different IT support office\n* Old site allowed us to use their wifi/network (with separate VLAN/wireless/ethernet for us)\n* New site will have nothing but an internet drop\n* Our revenue arrives in the form of fax or email POs. Those orders get converted to physical products, packaged and shipped. The invoices go out email. \n* 7 people, 7 computers. All will be hard wired.\n* \"Courtesy\" wifi - i.e., not needed for production, just mobile devices, looking up manuals / email etc.\n* Email is served from corporate via MS Exchange - so just need an internet connection with the right ports.\n* Need to add local and cloud backup - currently we just use attached USB drives. Better than nothing, but we need to get better at this part.\n* No LDAP/Radius/Etc - just use PC passwords - but we need to do something here for a central/local/cloud backup\n* VOIP phones (ringcentral - but we can switch). Not very happy with the polycom hardware we have though.\n\n* Will have need for telecommute VPNs.\n* Finances uses Sage, which is served via remote desktop from cloud service.\n\nI'm in the middle of working with a couple local IT providers as well as direct with Sophos and Meraki providers. Really at the start of this process.\n\n# Backup\n\nAs mentioned, we use attached USB drive now. But that isn't good enough. The current thought is to go simple with a Synology NAS that grabs a copy of the user folders once a day or so. Then uploads a snapshot to the cloud on a nightly / weekly basis. This would take some habit changes on the part of users to ensure they put all files into their Home directory, but it would be simple.\n\n* Software and setup to grab the user's PC data? Other than using something like Cobian to manage this?\n* Do I need a LDAP (or other) user authentication for this, or can I simply use the separate NAS login credentialing? We're only 7 people, so really just worried about accidental screwing things up, not deliberate. (i.e., User A just doesn't muck around in User B's folders).\n\nI suppose the worst case is either the building burns down or we get ransom-wared. The likely case is somebody deletes or corrupts a file they need.\n\nWe're not a legal or health care firm, so the data security and retention needs aren't there.\n\n#Questions\n\nWhat I really need is a basic primer so I know the right questions to ask. I'm 99% sure we're going to use a local or remote sys-admin to manage the install. I can confidently run ethernet wires and manage the physical install, but it's the system setup that I'd rather not have to do.\n\nThe critical stuff: email, VOIP, finance is all cloud. So we just need basic internet access (with appropriate small business level security) to do 95% of our job (I think?).\n\n* I'm pretty sure we need some sort of user authentication to manage PC log-ins and NAS access. Where should I look so I can learn the basics?\n* Any feedback on Sophos vs Meraki vs Fortinet vs other?\n* Any issues with mixing providers? (i.e., a Sophos WAN with Unifi APs) (Other than 2+ management screens vs. one)\n* Advice on Local / Cloud backup?\n",

Thanks to an office 365 limitation we want to split some archives up, anything 2 years or newer goes to the inbox while anything older goes to the archive. That is easy to get software for and is not a big issues.\n\nWe have PSTs that are 18-60GB in size (shoot me). My predecessor didn't want to increase our prior 2010 on-prem storage nor take the time to host PSTs in an archive on that server in online archives so people used those. On-top of that he had told them to manually move everything into it and not keep things in the inbox (please hit me with a truck). So i have archives that are highly highly corrupt thanks to this.\n\nI have ran scanpst all I can on them, to the point where it finds minor inconsistency but I can do no more with them. What I am looking for is a tool that is reputable that we can buy to split these, re-merge them, maybe split again, and repair. Bonus points for the ability to use multiple PST's at once.\n\nBelow are the ones I have tested, but I am looking for some idea's on what I should look at or testimony on those I have listed below.\n\nStellar Phoenix Outlook PST Repar\n\nSysTools Outlook Recovery\n\nKernel for Outlook PST Repair",

I was planning on using this server as our on-prem LabTech server, but I am worried that it is not using ECC ram (as labtech uses a database). Buying a new server at the moment is not possible, since we just dropped a ton of money to get antivirus and labtech.\n\nSo, what are your thoughts? Current Specs - i3-2100, 8gb RAM, 1x 500gb SATA HDD\n\nKeep it as is and then put it on a new server when we can buy a new one? Go to Server Monkey and buy a cheap refurbished server? I could really use some help\n\nEdit: Thank you for all your help. Yes I know all the flaws that everyone has been pointing out and everything else that is wrong here (all IT team are domain admins are their main account, plus 1 'shared' admin account with the same password across the board). I know there is no RAID redundancy. I know its an old server. I am just trying to work with what I have and make this place better, and slowly phase out the old servers (yes we still have a couple 2003 servers) and upgrade us. Another major issue is virtualization. My boss is pretty much against it, so 1 box = 1 service. So it's not like i can come out with a decked out r730 and just run a bunch of VMs (which I would like). Only time will tell",

            "selftext": "# Background\n\nI was using a Windows 10 machine with 8 GB of RAM. I probably had way too many multiprocess Firefox Nightly tabs in RAM at once. The machine was swapping heavily. Then it hung for maybe a minute; I couldn't even move the mouse. After that, I saw a Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) for maybe half a second. Finally, the machine rebooted. I have no idea what the bugcheck code or description was; the BSOD disappeared too quickly.\n\nWindows didn't create a Memory.dmp file.\n\nThere are various reasons why a machine might not create a memory dump file. For a list of half a dozen reasons, see the article [\"Windows does not save memory dump file after a crash\"](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/130536/windows-does-not-save-memory-dump-file-after-a-crash).\n\nFor [safety reasons](https://superuser.com/questions/1254314/windows-first-saves-crash-dumps-to-the-pagefile-it-only-moves-the-data-into-a-s), when Windows decides to save a memory dump to disk, it doesn't create a new file; instead, it overwrites the pagefile with the memory dump. After you reboot, it fixes things up on disk.  If you'd like details, see the article [\"5 Phases of Dump File Generation\"](http://www.carrona.org/dumpgen.html).\n\nIn my case, maybe the paging file was too full of swapped-out Firefox tabs. No, that doesn't make sense. OK, fine; maybe the [dump_ miniport driver](http://www.carrona.org/dumpgen.html) was corrupted, and Windows detected the corruption.\n\nOr maybe the page file was too small. [This article](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/brad_rutkowski/2007/10/16/not-getting-kernel-memory-dumps-in-windows-vista-or-windows-2008/) adds:  \"If the pagefile is not big enough, switching to minidump at dump time can\u2019t be done easily.\"  So perhaps the pagefile wasn't big enough to hold an \"automatic memory dump\", and Windows decided not to create any memory dump at all.\n\n# The real problem\n\nHere's the weird thing.  In \"Advanced system settings > Advanced > Startup and Recovery\", I had \"Write an event to the system log\" also enabled.\n\nYet the System log showed only error 6008:  \"The previous system shutdown ... was unexpected\".\n\n# Question\n\nSo there was no bugcheck event logged to the System log. Why might no bugcheck event have been logged?\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n# Edit\n\nA second question.  Can Windows really write an event to the system log if there's a BSOD onscreen?  Does it actually just write an event to the pagefile, and that event gets copied to the system log after I reboot?",

            "selftext": "Hey Everyone\n\nI'm debating on whether or not I should go back to school.  I believe my employer would pay for it.\n\nI'm 31, engaged, and about to buy a house.  Pretty soon some little ones are probably gonna come along (prob 2-4 years).  Right now I've got a good job as an admin (public sector FTW).  The deadlines are pretty flexible , coworkers and bosses are great, and the after hours interruptions are pretty sparse.  The pay is the only real drawback (our benefits are also getting cut back) but I feel like it's hard to put a price on a good work place where you enjoy what you do.\n\nI have my bachelor's degree in a liberal arts area but I totally lost passion for that field and grad school was pretty much a necessity if I wanted to get good employment.  I've always been a lifelong computer geek.  I've also been a self-learner and found anything computer science interesting.  \n\nAfter seeing a potential grim future in retail management, I decided to go back to school at a community college where I was able to get an associates in programming and an associates in IT to market myself.  I really hunkered down and studied hard during this time in my life.  I would read those damn Deitel programming books cover to cover. I would also play around with all sorts of servers in my home lab. From there I ended up finally getting my foot in the door (this was in 2011 when jobs were scarce) as a tech at my first employer.  I then moved on up to where I am now a year later.  \n\nI guess I'm conflicted because I could easily see myself staying at my current job for a long time so I don't really see much of a benefit in having a Master's as far as moving up the chain.  I'd almost just be doing it because I really like understanding the inner workings of things and currently have a Fair amount of free time which won't last forever once kids come into the picture.  I often find myself reading articles and watching videos related to anything from algorithm design to policy based routing implementation.  People think I'm nuts but I genuinely enjoy learning about these things.  I'm sure some of you folks here can relate.  With all of the accredited online degree programs now I'm really thinking about putting my learning towards a Masters.  The fact that it would be paid for makes it even more appealing.  \n\nMy concern is burnout, there are some days, though they are rare, where I just don't want to do anything tech related when I get home from work.  I'm also pretty sure I have to pay the money back if I were to not graduate for some reason.  I also dread the idea of possibly having to take any undergrad pre-reqs in order to get into a program.  I'm a whole lot lazier these days than I was when I was in college (just being honest).  \n\nHas anyone here been in a similar situation?  If so what did you end up doing and do you wish you would have done the opposite?  Also to people who ended up getting a Masters in the field (not an MBA) do you feel like it really benefitted you in the workplace?",

The website is 100% HTML. Everything is HTML5, no javascript, no flash, no PHP, no ASP, our webdev did a amazing job. So I can literally host this with anything.\n\nNow my real question, what is the 'norm' for hosting a small tiny site like this? I set up a Windows Server 2016 VM, joined it to our domain, and gave it a NIC on our internal network, and a NIC with a public IP. Now our 'public IP' is routed through a SonicWall NSA for routing purposes, and has botnet/antivirus gateway/security services enabled on it. Only port 80 and 443 are allowed to that system via the Sonicwall NSA. All Windows firewall rules are locked down for public to only allow 80/443. Is this more or less secure than say giving it just a single NIC on our internal network, and simply adding a NAT translation for anything coming in to a outside public IP to route to the internal network IP instead, just for specific ports? \n\nAlso, any tips security wise to lock down the 2016 server would be appreciated!

            "selftext": "Hello all my fellow sysadmins,\n\nI am in quite a bind this month, i currently work for an MSP and we service a realty company, they currently have a dell PowerEdge T110 server with windows server 2008R2 installed with the FSMO roles of DHCP server and DNS currently active. I was tasked with creating a contingency plan for this server and to be honest it is a nightmare, they have 1 SCSI hard drive installed on the server with 2 partitions, 1 for the OS, 1 is a recovery partition and on the system there are also 4 mapped network drives where they all share files for real estate listings (they have 10 to 12 users sharing files through active directory). They also have 2 RDP sessions that remote into a virtual server running on the same machine under Hyper-V, this is used for the lotusnotes suite of applications (a domino server) I want to at least put into place a hardware failover solution for the SCSI drive but i am having a hard time, i would like to clone the drive to a new SATA drive but from what i have read this can be troublesome and i have an entire business on the line. Have any of you dealt with a situation like this? I need to be able to either migrate all of there stuff to a new piece of hardware INTACT or clone it INTACT with MINIMAL or NO downtime or DATA LOSS. The sysadmin before me put together a system with 0 fail over solutions and this system is honestly over 10 years old and hanging by a thread, if it was up to me i would just gather all of the data they use in lotus notes and key it in manually to a new software solution that works in a similar fashion after i built a new server and installed server 2012 or server 2016 and set everyone up with accounts, put them into groups and created my GPOs but im dealing with people who are for lack of a better word cheap. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Oh and by the way all the users are running windows 7 machines that connect to the domain.\n",

To start, the business is a help desk for local small business and residents. We take credit cards through a small card reader connected to the ethernet and do not store any card info locally. We have two locations that are connected via a site to site Cisco VPN (RV042G) and I believe it may be causing some of the failures. Listed below are all of the failure points reported by Trustwave:\nBlock cipher algorithms with block size of 64 bits (like DES and 3DES) birthday attack known as Sweet32, CVE-20162183\nSSL Certificate Public Key Too Small\nSSLv3 Supported\nTLSv1.0 Supported\nSSL version 3 protocol padding oracle attack (POODLE), CVE2014-3566\nSSL/TLS Weak Encryption Algorithms, CVE-2013-2566 CVE-2015-2808\nI have been doing research for days on what these are and how to fix them but have gotten nowhere. Our two stores are being charged monthly for these failures and I have been tasked with the job of becoming compliant. I have seen the suggestion for adding another phone line for the credit reader but that would increase our monthly cost, which is not an option. It was suggested to use the provided fixes from Trustwave but I could not find anything that resembled a fix for any of the vulnerabilities.\nI have read many fixes on forums for some of these vulnerabilities but nowhere do they specify where I am actually making these fixes. I have 3 Windows workstations at my office and there are about 6 workstations and 2 servers at our other location. In my office, I have an ISP provided modem converting the cable to an off the shelf wi-fi AP. I can update this post with the networking hardware for our other location as it has been over a year since I have been there. Our server is used or Quickbooks and OSticket but we ran a scan with them turned off and we still failed. (The listed failures are strictly for my office and not the second location.)\nMy first plan has been to set up two PFSense firewalls containing our out of data VPN in a form of a DMZ so that the external scan would not see the issues. But learning the software has been a bit of a hurtle. I'm sure with time I will get the hang of it but for now, I just wanted to make sure I am not wasting my time.\nAs far as Windows vulnerabilities I always make sure all workstations are all updated, and I am always up to date on infosec twitter to make sure none of our customers/office has any open 0days. I considered myself pretty technical but these vulnerabilities have been kicking my ass so any input would be greatly appreciated. If anybody needs any more information let me know.\nThanks again.",

I bought one of these a bit a go with the grand plan of upgrading the RAM, filling the other CPU socket, and loading it up with drives for a Windows Server but my dreams were dashed when I booted it to find a ROM. What I am looking for is any help getting this to boot Windows Server 2016. I contacted Coraid support and they confirmed it was possible but provided no details. Currently I have an HDD in one of the bays and a USB with Win Server 2016 on it. The BIOS offers options for USB booting but I can never seem to get it to recognize the USB. The only thing I can really seem to get out of it is either the ROM prompt or a weird \"boot: \" prompt that doesn't allow input.\n\nThanks a bunch in advance!

While we do have a few truly shared computers (5 or more people may log on them during the course of the day) that currently have a full install of office on them that I don't mind keeping, my question is about the 'one-off' shared useage case. \n\nSo say I have 50 users, all licenced for O365 Business Premium. Bob travels to our satellite office, and he forgets his laptop. Alice is out of the office so Bob logs onto Alice's computer (Alice is also licensed and has Office installed) - can he run Office applications? Does he have to 'reinstall/reactivate' under his user account? Does this count as 1/5 of his installs? How long before this install counter is reset?\n\n\nThanks for the feedback",

Ideally this is to map out existing security procedures in place in order to help identify overall strengths/weaknesses so we can adjust accordingly.  I had started by listing our applications and their built in auth processes and then surrounded that by our network and how users authenticate to that (including which protocols are used).  But I'm having a hard time turning it into a semi-pretty diagram I can present to management that would clearly show them what might require stronger access controls/auth methods or where access to similar types of data aren't in line with each other (maybe it only takes 1 logon to access private data via one method but takes 3 logons to access it a different way).\n\nSo yeah, anyone know of any fancy or pretty diagram types to help display this kind of data?  I've been image searching various diagram types but having a hard time finding one I can adapt into my situation.  I figure worst case I can whip something up manually in Visio with blocks representing apps and data types and lines for auth methods and protocols but I was hoping to be a little more creative/professional than that.  I would be very appreciative for some suggestions on any more professional charts or diagrams that are out there.  Thanks!",

Ok; so technically the local loop is provided by a local carrier but the actual call routing is handled by Level3 IP services. As a backup to this we have implemented a handful of SIP trunks and the main inbound numbers will automatically fail over to the SIP number when Level3 sees it go down.\n\nSo yesterday the PRI went down and inbound calls failed over as they were supposed to. However the call quality was choppy at best - unintelligible at times. I called the SIP provider and they said the issue was on our end. The dispatchers were not satisfied and some of them even used their personal phones. Level3 had a major outage with their network yesterday that was fixed around 6:30 or so the ticket says.\n\nHOWEVER the next day I just decided to do a traceroute to our SIP IP's only to find out that they too; go through Level3's networks at some point. Specifically ae-8-13.bar1.cleveland1.level3.net. Extensive testing of the SIP trunks today shows cal quality is spot on and the problem doesn't exist.\n\nEven when you think you have perfect redundancy, things that you don't know about don't and it can stab you in the back.",

Here is a rundown of the issue I've experienced.\n\nSince I have been here, I created an AD account for myself, as well as created a mailbox for the account. I am able to access this account via OWA. However, when I've tried to add the account to Outlook for Android, I am unable to get a connection to the server. I have noticed other users are using the Outlook app on their phones just fine, but these were setup before I came here. But today, I noticed another issue with a user who is trying to setup their email on their personal laptop which has Office 2016, and I am unable to get their email to connect. I have done some googling, but I haven't found a resolution to this yet. Normally I would have looked at their own laptop as the issue, but I am unable to connect to my account either unless it's through OWA, unable to set it up in Outlook for Android or Outlook 2016 on my main computer.",

That group could be hardcoded, it doesn't need to have a list of groups to select from.\n\nI am looking to set up the wiki to include documentation for various business processes, etc.  Some of these pages will refer to processes that are controlled and/or officially approved, and only a specific AD group should be able to edit these once they are created.  \n\nI've tried setting up MediaWiki, which does have a plugin for LDAP Auth which works fine for handling user credentials.

The wireless policy is deployed out via group policy.  We use an external dhcp server(not Windows).  On Windows 10 clients the wireless will not connect automatically upon restart(most of the time).  Sometimes when the laptop gets reset it will automatically connect and we can login to the domain fine.  Most times however if the user doesn\u2019t have cached credentials on the laptop, they will get a cannot contact domain controller error.  The issue doesn\u2019t happen if we connect via Ethernet.  The problem only happens with wireless.  My testing is specifically on a Dell Latitude E5470, but the issue happens on other manufacture/models also.\nI have tested this on a domain joined laptop and an unjoined laptop to make sure it wasn\u2019t a policy issue.\nOn a domain joined laptop I can login to the computer using cached credentials and then sometimes it will automatically connect to wireless, sometimes not after logging in.  Sometimes I need to manually click on the wireless list in the system tray and connect, then it immediately connects and is fine until a restart .  Also sometimes just leaving the laptop at the login window it will automatically connect to wireless after 30 seconds or so.\n\nOn the unjoined laptop, at the login screen it will stay not connected or connect to wireless, until I login, which sometimes it will connect automatically, and sometimes I need to manually click on the wireless list in the system tray and connect, then it immediately connects and is fine until a restart.  If I logoff the laptop, it will disconnect from the wireless and remain so until logging in and the above repeats.\nIm not finding any radius errors on the radius sever event log.\n\nAny thoughts on what I can do to help this issue?  Thank you for any ideas.  Feel free to ask any followup questions.\n\n**UPDATE:**  It seems like Windows 10 1607 was the problem.  Updating the clients to 1703 cleared up the issue and cant replicate the issue at all now.\n",

We've checked the spam/malware filters in exchange online and don't see anything.\n\nThe external users never get any NDRs, and we spoke with a few of the sysadmins at the external organizations and they are saying that the reply got sent out of their email server without issues.\n\nThis is happening with multiple different external clients, using different email services, and none of them get any NDR. \n\nWe have tested using external email services and never had any issues replying to their emails.\n\nThis has been going on for well over a year and I have tried everything I could think of, has anyone ever had something like this happen before, or any ideas?\n\nAlso, they use goldmine as their email client\n\n-Edit- I've also tried\n\n- Moving between office 365 tenants, setting it up fresh\n- Checking Spam / black lists that I could find\n- Calling previous ISPs and DNS providers to see if any records for our domain is still in their system\n- Clearing the external users autocomplete cache in outlook and remaking the contact\n- Message traces in exchange online\n\n\nAnd a few more things that I can't recall..\n",

I guess no one here wants to deal with that.\n\nI may be new in the IT world but I'm sure there's something that can and needs to be done. My boss isn't against fixing it of course, he just doesn't prioritize it. He says that I can try to learn how to do it myself, but I don't want to do it in production.\n\nI found a bunch of guides while googling but a lot of them are different. Guess there are a few methods of doing so, and each environment has it's own parameters to consider before doing so.\n\nWhat can I do? Should I just push him to call an integrator?

The local account 'Philipp' was logged in and running 'CCleaner' alongside myself logged in as the domain account.\n\nThere's no reason for any local accounts to be on this domain joined server, so I logged the account off. The account logged itself back in after about 5-10 minutes. I disabled the account in Local Users and Groups, but the account re-enabled itself and logged in again.\n\nI restarted the machine entirely after disabling the account, but lo and behold, I can see it logged in after I log in myself. I've removed this machine from the domain, removed the network cards and turned off the VM.\n\nI've got no idea what the payload is, what this thing was trying to do or even how long it's been there for. I tried searching through Event Viewer to see when it was created or logging in but as soon as I opened Event Viewer, the thing wiped it clean... 0 entries...\n\n\nIf anybody has any suggestions beyond just rebuilding the VM, I'm all ears. I'd like to try and patch any vulnerability before opening myself up to another intrusion like this.\n\nThanks!",

So, please forgive the tone of this post if it starts to sound like a rant (which it sort of is). It has come to my attention that our Administrators, who have no IT experience whatsoever, have taken it upon themselves to completely reorganize the directory structure on our file server. This has caused no end of trouble since this has broken mapped network locations, file & folder permissions, group policies and God knows what else across the whole company. So, I'm here picking up the pieces trying to adjust to the changes. My first question would be how to request that they please leave things alone when they don't understand the ramifications of making changes without first consulting IT. The way they see it, it's their network and they can do whatever they want with it. \n\n**Edit**\nWell, good news, bad news. The bad news is that even more changes have been made. The good news is that I don't report directly to administration. *My* boss is going to have to handle this one. Hopefully he can get them to see reason.",

            "selftext": "Hello everybody,\n\nI'm working on a project where all our mobile phones (50ish) have to be replaced soon. Before I can present the project to management I need to know (in general terms) how we will do the deployment of the devices and it's price and time investment. They also expect all the data (pictures, smses, apps,..) to be transfered over from their old phones to their new ones. Most of this wouldn't be a problem with google backups but most of these devices were put on 1 google account by my predecessor (less setup work).\n\nSo here is my plan atm, If the user doesn't have a private google account we set one up based on their exchange email (manual only from what I can find). We then use a MDM to quickly deploy the new devices to a basic setup (google account, language settings, virus scanner, exchange account added, calendar set up,...). Once we have a basic phone a new user would receive we can then get the old phone and transfer over all the data through... Anytrans? Probably some kind of 3rd party app that can also transfer the text messages.\n\nSo what do you think? is a MDM overkill for 50 people? Did I forget anything? Am I suggesting the correct or wrong tools for the job? Never did anything like this and I would prefer not having to install 50 phones with their data manually.\n\nThanks in advance, any advice is welcome!\n\nEdit: [mobiletrans](https://mobiletrans.wondershare.com/) looks pretty good to transfer all the images and such over.",

After some fixing of peoples computers and taking the responsibility of a few servers, I am now the dedicated sysadmin here. Don't worry, we still pay our old IT service provider to come over every week or two to help me out since I don't have all the know-how and wisdom that's needed to take 100% percent over this place. Not even close.\n\nNow before I moved to this city I worked as a java programmer and my old company used JIRA and Mediawiki with a little bit of Scrum here and there and it was a bliss. This online shop here is very chaotic. Most of the information and ToDos have spread around on papers, post its and emails. Decisions are constantly made on the floor and not well communicated. So I bought a Dell R430 and want to spin up some VMs with... yeah that's my question. Atlassian seems to be pushing all the customers straight to the cloud to a point where the [kanban boards for JIRA Core are not going to be released on the server version besides being available for cloud customers](https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-45690) (yes I am very salty). As a German company going to the cloud is, besides being a stupid idea, so difficult that it's not even an option. I am hesitant to invest time and money into solutions from a company that clearly tells us to go cloud or gtfo.\n\nThis leads me to the point where I am looking for alternatives. The market for \"groupware\" as it seems called is swamped by cloud offers like Trello or Flow. I would like to have a groupware that\n\n- Offers an on-premise version\n- Offers visual, nice looking kanban boards\n- Offers a visual, easy to use Wiki (I already launched an internal Mediawiki server. People are using it but it's a little bit too clunky for most people in the fashion industry)\n\nRight now I am taking a really close look at **taiga.io**, but for the love of god, I can't get it to run properly on an Ubuntu server. I know that I am by no means a Linux pro but I've set up a couple of Linux servers (including JIRA and Confluence servers) over the last years by googling and following the instructions, slowly understanding a few of the key concepts regarding Linux servers. I've followed the Taiga docs *very* closely and all  I just get [this](https://image.prntscr.com/image/WMNbTs_pSWqPkJc6OtCtPQ.png) screen.\n\nSo what are solutions that you guys would suggest to get this office organized? Any opinions and stories regarding Atlassian, Taiga and other alternatives are welcome.\n",

EDIT: AFTER THIS, INSTALLED A TEST OS AND USING HD TACH I CAN ONLY GET 63/MB SEC OVER LAN WITH THIS SETUP, AND I SETUP SAME TEST ON THE HOST OS W HDD IN THERE SAMSUNG SSD ALSO BUT 2 GEN OLDER, IT GETS 464MB/SEC\n\n\nor do I have to create 30 individual ISCSI LUNs with 60GB each ?\n\n\n\nEDIT: \n\nreading more on this topic i found \n\n\"iSCSI LUN (Regular Files): The iSCSI LUN is created by designating a portion of the volume space for its usage. You can expand its size later when necessary. This type of iSCSI LUN provides the flexibility of dynamic capacity management with Thin Provisioning, VMware VAAI hardware acceleration support, Windows ODX support, LUN snapshot and LUN clone.\" \n\nso does that mean if I make 30 of the 60gb ones.

I'm currently handling software licensing for the company, but from what I've looked at so far this is a much thornier sandwich. \n\nOur current situation is that we're not sure if we have enough CALs, not sure if we bought the right CALs, not sure who bought the CALs, and not sure what happened to the guy who was previously supposed to be maintaining them, Cal.\n\nThe way I see it I need to:\n\n1. Determine what software we have that resides on windows servers, and what version of server each of them are.\n\n2. Determine which machines are touching each of these servers (if they're touching multiple servers, like exchange and another file server, they need CALs for each, right? Or no?!).\n\n3. Determine which users are touching these servers.\n\n4. Figure out how many of each kind of CAL we possess.\n\n5. Determine how many CALs we need from what I learn in steps 1-4\n\n6. Use some kind of math or something to figure out which type of CAL is more cost effective for us to purchase, in order to shore up our licensing.\n\n7. Figure out what RDS CALs are used for exactly, and whether we need them.  \n\nIf anyone knows how to do any of these things, or knows a good resource for learning more about this, I'd super appreciate that info.  \n\ntl;dr I'm about to be ass-deep bent-over in CALs and I am not prepared.\n\n**EDIT**: Learning more, still fuzzy on RDS CALs.  It's like, if someone uses a machine to access something on a windows server, then a device or user CAL works.  But one of the network guys was saying if we put a certain software (Cygwin terminal) on a terminal server, for users to access and use to access data on a Linux server, it would require RDS CALs.  \n\nThat last sentence is confusing, but maybe this will help:\n\n**User on a Windows PC** *accesses Terminal Server* -------> **Windows Terminal Server with Cygwin** *Passes Commands to Linus Server*-------->**DB on Linux server** *Replies to request*\n\nThis situation requires an RDS CAL, because they're using the server to access an additional server?

            "selftext": "Hi Guys, \nJust after some opinions. \nI'm finding myself writing more and more scripts for various tasks across our Enterprise org. It's only small, 150 servers, 600 odd workstations, but we're extremely reliant on our systems so there are loads of areas for improvement. \n\nPowerShell (and other types) of automation are really helping in a lot of areas, but coming from a typical sysadmin role, I lack the background in code maintenance etc.\n\nI've decided to start looking into Github (hooked into VSCode) for maintaining my scripts and versioning however I'm looking for a good place to centralise the actual running of the scripts. \nOther options for this type of thing would be appreciated, I want something more than just a folder in OneDrive where I store my scripts (though that does have auto versioning ;) ) \n\nI'd like to be able to run all scripts on various server groups, on various schedules from a single product. Ideally, I'd like to get a single pane of glass type approach so we can see an overview of all the scripts running all over the show. (as opposed to various scripts running in task scheduler on various machines and an Excel spreadsheet keeping an outdated record of these) \n\nAnsible and the use of playbooks and WinRM to launch powershell looks promising, but I'm keen to hear others thoughts. I'm sure many of you have been in this position, and I've read through various posts, but as always, things change and something a year ago may not be pertinent in 2017. \n\nI don't mind if it's Agent / Agentless. For workstation automation, software installs and scripts, we use ConnectWise Automate (as it's bundled for us). I find it okay for workstations, but not reliable enough for the Server side of things. \n\nThanks SysAdmins! \n\n** Edit \nHas anyone used Jenkins for this, and have they used it in conjunction with a source repository and just point Jenkins to scripts stored in said repo, so that updates to scripts in the repo's get run by Jenkins by just updating the one script? Just keen on experiences with this. \n\n",

            "selftext": "Hey sysadmins. Looking for some advice you may be able to give from your own experience. We currently have a rack in a datacenter we use to host VMs in ESX. We have pretty much all types of VMs from file servers, DCs, web servers, SQL servers etc. We have a pretty nice setup with good redundancy on all levels - but we currently use Synology NAS devices and NFS for the VDMKs (over a 1gbps network). We have a bunch of 4 bay DS916+ with SSDs in Synology SHR (kind of like Synology version of Raid 5 I think). TBH, speed usually isn't too much of issue - unless we're doing a backup of a VM or other large data transfer - then things can slow down for other VMs. So we have to schedule any type of large-scale data movement for night. But the storage is definietly the bottleneck speed-wise.\n\nWe are at a crossroad where we can make a few changes to the infrastructure. Our options are to move to DAS on the hosts (HP DL380s) or stay on NFS and beef up our network and hardware (10gbps network and something like the Synology RackStation RS3617xs+). I supposed DAS is always going to be faster, but for some reason I still like the idea of separating compute and storage. And so far the Synologies have been rock solid.\n\nI'd love to see what people recommend - whether there is a distinct advantage of one system over another. I know that we could go a \"proper\" SAN - but that is significantly increasing the costs and is not really somewhere our budget can stretch to...\n\nThanks in advance for any advice shared.",

I think I have narrowed the problem down to the exchange server getting a bad MX record, looking up the A record, seeing that the IP in the A record *has port 25 open and listening*, and then tries to send email to it, but gets access denied.  I'm guessing that this behavior is a result of  [Section 5 of RFC 5321](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5321#section-5). We don't have any routing group connectors. To fix this, I've tried blocking the mail server from accessing the bad IP address's port 25, hoping that it will try the MX lookup again and send to the correct address, but I doubt that will fix it.   This problem is intermittent; most of the time the emails go through, but once every few days it will get bounced, and the mail server's logs all report the mail server sending the the wrong IP address (the A record).

Our on-prem setup includes a few Linux VMs and a Synology NAS, but we mainly rely on cloud servics such as Office 365, ODfB, LastPass, and a couple industry-specific hosted applications. Despite falling short of some best practices, the setup has worked for a couple years.\n\nGoing forward, however, I'd like to have some sort of directory service to better centralize user management. I don't need to manage computer logins\u2014Macs don't always play well with directory accounts and Apples MDM/DEP spec allows us enough control over accounts/passwords. But we are looking to add several cloud applications to our workflow\u2014LiquidFiles for file transfer, Confluence for knowledge base, as well as a couple open-source apps that offer LDAP integration (the primary one being Snipe-IT)\u2014and I *really* don't want to have to create and manage users for each. My crude understanding is that this is where directory services shine.\n\nUnfortunately a Windows Server with Active Directory is off the table (unless I can present a really strong business case for it). One option I've looked at is Azure AD. I know it isn't a replacement for a full Active Directory domain, but we don't need computer logins, GPOs, and a lot of the other AD components, just centralized user accounts mostly for cloud apps. This *seems* to me to be almost exactly what Azure AD is.\n\nAnother potential option is Synology DSM's ability to run a Samba-based [Active Directory Server](https://www.synology.com/en-us/dsm/feature/active_directory) or [LDAP Server](https://www.synology.com/en-us/dsm/packages/DirectoryServer). We may run one of these instead or or alongside Azure AD, depending on whether it can meet all of our needs (integrating Synology accounts into the directory solution would be an added bonus). Again, not a full-fledged AD replacement, but I don't think we need it to be.\n\n**TL;DR:**\n\n* Is Azure AD what I'm looking for to create/manage a single user account per-person across Office 365, LastPass, Salesforce, LiquidFiles, Confluence, and Snipe-IT?\n\n* Will I *also* need an LDAP server for services or open-source apps that use ldap authentication, such as Snipe-IT?\n\n* Would a Samba-based AD Server (such as the one that runs on Synology) achieve this instead, and would it be able to integrate with Azure AD?\n\nI hope I'm not asking too broad or too specific of questions. I'm not even sure I'm asking the right questions. I've done plenty of reading and looking at features lists, but I'm hoping someone will point me in the right direction (or at least tell me I'm headed in the right one) before I get too deep into the weeds. I feel like this is mostly straightforward, but I have limited experience in this area, and the most obvious tool isn't available.\n\nThanks in advance for your help and patience.",

Roughly 400ish devices, ~20 servers, 400 users, 2-person IT dept. \n\nWe've got a small mix of Chromebooks and a spattering of iPads.  But the rest -servers and workstations, are running Windows.\n\nA recent executive hire has come on board and is pretty adamant about getting an iMac desktop their use.  Along with that, the exec wants unfettered access (ie -admin) to said Mac and unfiltered internet access.  These requests are clearly unprecedented here, but I'm just IT, so it's not really my call.  The Exec claims to not be able to do their job efficiently without these demands being met.  So that puts any concern of my to be framed as a hurdle or obstacle to someone higher up getting their job done.  And that's no good for anyone.\n\nSo, as usual my goal is to look at it as objectively as possible. I want to mostly focus on facts, best practices, resources and costs.  I'm not trying to be a control freak, no am I trying to be change averse.  But I am opposed to wasting resources and subjecting the rest of our systems/network to potential risks. \n\nSo my question, coming from someone who hasn't dealt with a Mac computer in the workplace previously, what exactly would one expect to have to do to get it to play nice with our existing infrastructure?  Network shares, GPOs, etc.  What sort of additional resources will be required.\n\nAnd beyond that, do you think the idea of a single user on a Mac with full-admin access to (local machine) is a real concern? If so, can you point to reference/links that I can also share to make this point?\n\nI'm really trying to stay on the technical side of things - in part because that's my real job, and in part because on a personal level it doesn't really matter to the higher-ups if I think this person is being unrealistic and flat out wrong about not being able to do certain tasks with the already provided and supported Windows workstations we provide.  One of the reasons given  for *needing* the iMac is that the current Dell monitor provided has a resolution that \"is not of a level that allows me to see clearly without significant straining.\"  Note that the monitor is a 23\" 1080p display..  Of course it doesn't compare to the 27\" 5K retina display of the iMac, but strangely enough none of the other almost 400 users in the building have a problem with their display (some of which are smaller and lower resolution yet)\n\nI'm trying not to make this a rant about unrealistic end users or ridiculous execs - despite those being popular and entertaining here.  I'd really rather sort out how to approach this situation and be self aware enough to know if I'm being stubborn/set in my ways and need to relax a bit or if all logical signs point to the idea being a bad one from a systems/network standpoint.  And then to gather up those thoughts and supporting resources to take to our next meeting /discussion about the issue..\n\n**EDIT/UPdate: One of the big factors here is the Exec's love of the built-in MacOS software apps.  I'm not familiar at all with them, but I find it hard to believe in these modern times that there's such a distinction and OS specific software piece as to be fully dissimilar from a Windows-based solution. Can anyone speak to that angle?  I see mention of something like Keynote being usable from any browser with iCloud..is that just marketing or is Keynote not really a valid example of a MacOS-only software application?\n\nEdit 2 - Thanks for the great responses so far, keep 'em coming! \nAnother specific question: If we get the Mac online and the user then also wants to run Boot Camp and boot into Windows (win7), is there any sort of special licensing considerations I should be aware of? Or does our standard MS Vol. lisce treat it the same?  How the heck to I deal with getting it proper updates and imaging it if it's only occasionally booted into Windows??",

But I still find it really too cumbersome to use, especially for corner cases, like for internal networks or development purposes. Indeed, I'm not [the only one](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/5kr4hx/lets_encrypt_is_not_the_solution_to_every/). These views are really mine. I think the situation could even be worse if you add IoT and SMB/home networks, where it is almost impossible to establish any HTTPS connection (most of them don't have a local DNS and hence no split-DNS and hence no HTTPS - but this is another topic).\n\n\nAnyway, I think that I have a solution for most of these LE limitations.\n\n\nWhat if I provide such a solution:\n\n* I buy a regularly registered Internet domain (let's say imadomain.com)\n* I can assign each first level subdomain to each one a my users (let's say user1.iamadomain.com) and ensure each of them that I will never ever assign this subdomain to anyone else\n* I can request LE certificates for all of these users since I own the root domain\n* Each user is allowed to assign deeper subdomain\n* I can provide these private key / public key certificates to my users through any regular communication, preferably strongly secured (e.g. encryption of the certificate, secret token for auth, ...)\n\n\n**The drawbacks of this solution**\n\n* the servers names are not friendly anymore\n* the download of the certificate must be really secured\n* the user must have confidence in this service, e.g. that the service won't issue its subdomain to another user\n* the user can use these certificates only on internal network with split-DNS or through specific A/CNAME records I would configure for them\n\n\n**The advantages**\n\n* Much more devices could be elligible to LE certificate renewal, only a download could be sufficient\n* Even devices with only a crappy Internet connection could use LE renewal\n* Users don't have anymore to deal with domain registration and cumbersome LE renewal via whatever ACME protocol\n* LE does not need anymore to reach the user servers\n* A convenient API could easily issue tens to thousands of certificates per user\n* User can use LE certificates with split-DNS\n\n\nDoes it makes any sense to you or is it just garbage in my head ?

            "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nCurrently working on a project which involves the rollout of laptops to all members of staff (500 laptops or so). I have configured WDS for an easier build process. However, I'm at a cross-roads in terms of software deployment. \n\nI'm looking for a solution that enables users to install apps and updates in a self-service manner. The reason I want to do this is because the laptops will be connected to the corporate network infrequently making it hard to push out software (users will be off-site a lot). Giving the user the ability to choose when these installs/updates take place would be a real help. It would also reduces tickets and wait-time for software installs. \n\nMuch to my disappointment I've been told I can't use SCCM (licensing issues), and a lot of the applications are quite finicky (which sadly we have to use) meaning I can't throw together a simple install package by using a couple of switches. Something like PDQ Deploy would be perfect (I currently use the CLI to push software out to new machines with an MDT sequence), but unfortunately without the self-service feature it makes it a hard sell to management.\n\n\n\nAny suggestions? \nThanks guys :)",

Is there a registry key or something? \n\nLooking at google, it seems this is a fairly common problem, and the only option is \"don't use windows search/indexing\" - but thats for large RDS/terminal server environments where it wouldnt be feasable to never purge the index because the index file would get too large - in this case, I don't think I'll have an issue...\n\nAnyone know a way to make sure index never purges or re-indexes??",

As the DBA, I'm trying to take over management of our database backups - they are currently controled by the sysadmin's.  Right now the sysadmin's run nightly full backups only, the occasional transaction log backup only as a means of stopping transaction log growth, not really for recovery.\n\nWe have a lot of local drives attached to servers that we use for operational backups, sending to vendors, copying to test/dev testing etc.  So essentially we have two backup processes, one operational and one for DR.  \n\nI really want to move to Native SQL Server backups, with frequent transaction log backups.    \nMy current understanding of our Storeonce configuration is as follows; one Storeonce 4900 applicance at a primary and secondary location.  If we use data protector to schedule and perform the backups (as we do currently), my understanding is that the backups are deduped and replicated to both sites.\nIf we used the Catalyst Storeonce SQL Server plugin my understanding is that the backups are deduped and replicated to both sites.\n\nI proposed creating a CIF Share mapped to Storeonce (this seems to be a well documented solution) to use to write SQL Server backups to.  This would then allow us to make use \nof Native SQL Server tools, native alerting and monitoring and we would increase the scheduling of backups.\nI'm being told that to create a CIFS share and replicate it would require an additional license for replication, to the tune of $70,000 (STOREONCE 4900 REPLICATION ELTU).\nWe've tested the CIFS share itself and it works perfectly - without replication.\nSo I'm wondering if there is anyone out there with experience with Storeonce and SQL Server that could offer some inside or advice.  What is this license?  Is there another way\nto replicate the backups to a secondary site?  Frankly, we are never going to get funding for the cost of the replication license.\n",

It's my first gig, and I haven't been here all that long, but I'm seeing some real ethics issues that my boss either doesn't seem to care about or is too stuck in his ways to recognize are wrong, and I'm not sure what to do about it.\n\nBasically, there's not a day goes by that we don't lie to our clients. There's a wide range of things included in that, but to give you an idea, we have a list of things we make sure we turn on or off every time someone comes to audit so that we're actually compliant with their demands. Once they leave, we turn those things back to how they were. I've asked why we do this, and the answer is that some of our clients want X turned off, and others don't care, and since it's awkward to split up out workers according to what one client wants and another doesn't, instead of working with the least common denominator, we just throw a bunch of that out the window and tell the clients what they want to hear.\n\nOn top of that, there are some real security issues that my boss doesn't seem to think are a big deal. Anyone can get to anything on the network, we use domain admin for our regular work, etc.\n\nI'd like to see all of these things remedied, but when I've asked about them in the past, I've just gotten rationalizations that really boil down to \"This is how we've always done it.\" In an industry that moves as quickly as IT, you just can't be doing things the way you did them in 2000, but here we are.\n\nHow can I present these issues to my boss in such a way as to effect some change?\n\nEdit: We are not an MSP.

Now, they weren't active but we didn't take any chances. We ran System Restores on the machines but sadly it was still there in the previous versions that we were restoring too, so we spent about 2/3 whole days working at 2 different sites on around 60 machines using the cmd to remove each service by hand.\n\nWe thought we had cleared it, we couldn't see that it had done anything malicious but we did find something quite annoying, which was that they had taken the Outlook auto-complete address file from each machine. Now, you might think \"What a strange thing to take?\". You're right, it was a strange thing to take and we thought exactly the same and couldn't understand why. After about a week, we suddenly realised why.\n\nCustomers of our Customer where phoning our Customer saying \"We have just had an email from Tina Jeffards (obviously a fake name guys..) regarding an outstanding invoice? It has a .PDF attachment that links us to another website?\". We then quickly realised what had happened. The virus had like I say, taken the auto-complete address file, the contact book and then also taken the Display Name and Email Address from the machines it had been on. \n\nThe case that we are currently looking at includes an email appearing that it is from tina.jeffards@plasticbox.co.uk, but that is just in-fact a Display Name spoof, and it is actually coming from jkfgh@easy-mail.de or something stupid. It varies with every email we can't just block *@easy-mail.de because they aren't all from that domain. We then have it where sometimes they use the persons real name to make it look even more legitimate (where possible). It is just beyond a joke now, there is nothing we can do about it, it's absolutely crazy. \n\nTLDR; Customer got a virus, appeared to be harmless, we removed it from every machine, it stole the send from email address and contacts and auto complete file from outlook, sent emails to everyone pretending to be the customer using the from address as the display name, sent emails to staff in the customer company and their customers / suppliers spreading the same virus, out of our control. \n\nWasn't expecting any help, just wanted to rant a little bit about how crazy spam / phishing emails are now getting.",

I love it, but I don't have a network admin background and Google doesn't seem to have a clear answer for me.\n\n\nHere is my problem: We are going 1-to-1 with Chromebooks for all our 2-5 students. They all need their own email addresses for access to various parts of the Google Suite. Our former system admin didn't foresee us doing this so when he set up the network, he created an email shortcut called \"allstaff\" that emailed everyone with email addresses ending in our domain. Now when I create student email accounts, they are getting all of the staff messages as well as any master calendar updates that get pushed through.\n\n\nWhat I've tried: I first made sure that the \"allstaff\" group did not contain any of the student email addresses. Next, I created a group specifically for students so they would not be found within the main user list. I then sent a test email to allstaff, but they are still receiving the email updates from allstaff and the master calendar.\n\n\n\nThis has been really frustrating me for a week. Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit: Thanks all for your help. We decided to force our way around the problem and purchase a separate domain for the kids. It may not be the best solution, but I think it will work out as we created a domain name much shorter than our original so the younger kids will have an easier time of it. Thanks again1",

For more information contact your system administrator\"\n\nMoment X is an arbitrary concept I created to explain why everything that has been installed already is working fine, however nothing new will work. \n\nI have checked AppLocker settings, but there were none (default), but just just to be sure I activated the default rules and added an 'allow everything for everyone' rule; nothing changed. The application identity service is running btw.\n\nThere is no third-party software installed that can cause this, GPOs are clean (unless I missed something) and the eventlog doesn't log anything regarding the error.\n\nAt this point I only have only one solution: nuke and rebuild, which would be less than ideal as the time would not be billable.\n",

We have a static IP for that site on the ADSL connection but the LTE is dynamic IP and can't be fixed, it also goes through NAT via the mobile network provider so dynamic DNS doesn't work.\n\nQuestion is how best to configure the site to talk/connect to resources at our main site.\n\nWe have a watchguard T30 at main office, branch office using a Draytek 2860Ln which is setup with site to site VPN via slow ADSL to main office watchguard. Routing policies are set up on the Draytek to allow all non VPN traffic (i.e. internet browsing) through the quick LTE connection.\n\nCurrently the clients at the branch office get DHCP/DNS from the Draytek. They also have a small stand alone PC box sat under the desk which acts as a file server for local docs they share among themselves.\n\nClients get odd authentication issues sometimes when accessing resources at main office which, I suspect, is because they don't authenticate with the main office DC when logging in (Clients use domain joined laptops). Should I set up the draytek to be a DHCP relay to the DC in the main office? Other options I was mulling over was setting up a secondary DC at the branch office so the clients could authenticate with that if the connection to main office is unavailable?\n\nAnnoyance is that I want clients to be able to use the LTE connection to access resources at main office via VPN but the dynamic IP is preventing me doing it!",

A little bothered by the lack of exposure, documentation, and ability to fix things which I just took for granted when at an MSP, but I suppose it comes with the territory and helps keep stress levels low.\n\nI know basic troubleshooting and how to Google, pretty much all you need to know for any IT job from what I see tbh. Dealt with Windows Servers, Exchange (which I suppose is dead now with everyone going o365), sometimes firewalls and router configs but was rare because networking usually continues to work once it's set up, just whatever I came across I could usually just deal with it using whatever documentation I had and/or Google to sort it out.\n\nI am wondering if there's anything I should be learning right now while I have extra time. Have been meaning to learn Linux stuff, programming, go over Windows cert stuff again, go over Cisco cert stuff again, maybe check out what these Amazon Web Services and Azure things are..\n\nCan someone help me out?

To give you a little background, I have been the Director of IT for a growing company of about 100 employees for almost 3 years now. I don't have much supervision, and my task are kind of limited to my self-created projects, proactive-maintenance, emergencies and weekly TODO's from my supervisor. I love my job and the upper management team is essentially my extended family, we all have a genuine friendship on and off the clock. \n\nI could be overthinking all of this, but I just don't feel like I am contributing much to our company growth. I have no reason to believe upper management is dissatisfied with my work, but for the past 6 months I've had this feeling. I do have reasons to believe that this feeling is from the lack of challenging work I get to participate in, or just feeling plain left out of important company decisions. Since we are in the healthcare industry, I do not get to play around with the exciting new technologies emerging in the tech industry. Also, when I do feel like we could benefit from some new technology, I have a difficult time getting upper management excited to consider new integrations.\n\nAs I am writing this, I am wondering if this is just the consequences of the growing pains for IT in a SMB environment as we continue to grow. I have recently discussed this concern with my direct supervisor, but nothing really fruitful came out of it. \n\nI am very passionate my about companies success and my role, but I guess it is difficult for me to admit that I am unable to shine or give my employer all the benefits I have to offer. I am the type of person that thrives when I can make an impact by adding value, and lately I haven't really felt engaged or accomplished. Nonetheless, sometime this leaves me feeling like a failure, or guilty for not finding some innovative way of magically creating value or cutting cost. And before it is mentioned, I am not lazy and I feel like I do an exceptional job at fulfilling my job description, and doing all the typically IT daily task that is involved.\n\nAny thoughts or suggestions on becoming more engaged, or healing from this feelings? Has anyone ever gone through something similar?\n\n\nThanks!",

Shared calendar, do the permissions right, perfect.\n\nThe only snag I ran into is that when a user creates and event and invites the appropriate people, I can't seem to get the invite to go to the person that created the event. They want this because they want the event on their calendar as well to send that 15 min reminder before the event starts.\n\nSo the situation is - Person A creates an event. Sends the invite to himself and 5 other people. All 5 other people receive the email, click attending, and the event shows on their personal calendar. The invite never seems to go to Person A's mailbox, and then it never appears on their calendar.\n\nI'm not sure if this is working as intended, and if it is, is there any way to change that so they can have it working the way they want?\n\nThanks so much for any advice!",

I started really getting into computers when I was in early adolescence.  I spent all my teen years playing around with anything I could get my hands on.  After high school, I attended one of few tech schools in the province (up here in the nasty north) in a new media production course (heavy on design and light on dev), but then dropped out to chase oil money.  I spent the next ten years on a drilling rig, and barely if at all were my hands playing with technology.\n\nWell, the time has come for me to hang up my hard hat and put my boots away.  My marriage struggled with being away, my kids barely knew their dad.. time for a change.\n\nA friend of mine got me inspired to get into IT.  He said that with my previous experience and demonstrated ability to learn, I should be able to make a fine entry into this industry.  So I started studying, and I feel like now is a good time to get my feet wet.\n\nI know you guys see these posts often, but is there any advice you could provide about taking this specific test, or Microsoft exams in general.. I would certainly appreciate it.  I'm an old dog shifting gears in life (turned 31 a few months back), and I want to absolutely make the most out of it.\n\nThanks guys.  Cheers.",

After clearing interface Counters  I see 43GB of data being transferred even though my thin image size is just 10GB. Also Note the Destination ESXI still see's the VMDK disk as 10GB thin disk and not 42GB disk after the transfer has been done. Yes the destination server also says the provisioned size is 42GB. \n\n\nIs this normal? \n\nNote: if I create OVA template and do the deployment then the file transfer size is just 10GB when transferred over the network.

            "selftext": "Hello,\n\nFirst of all, I absolutely hate printers and everything having to do with printers. That's why I want this to work perfectly. \n\nI am in the process of setting up a small RDS farm (2 hosts, Server 2016 Standard) for about 50 users. The RDS servers essentially run a single application which is HIGHLY dependent on printer naming, even to perform seemingly non-printing functions (previews of reports, etc.). If the printers aren't available when the application is launched, it doesn't really function. If the default printer changes erroneously, the person using the app doesn't usually notice and ends up printing stuff to the wrong location which is just frustrating more than anything.\n\nAnyway, I say that only to put emphasis on how rock solid the printing functions need to be. I currently have the printers (approximately 25) deployed via 2 2012 R2 print servers applied to Computer level GPOs pointing to a single RDS server (which is what's being replaced). What is your preference for deploying printers in a situation like this? EasyPrint? I know there are a few different approaches, including non-Microsoft printing solutions. I just haven't had much practical experience beyond what was just mentioned.\n\nClients are all Windows 7 Pro x64 or Windows 10 Pro x64. Printers are small HP network desktop printer, RICOH MFP, or Zebra thermal.\n\nEmployees are all split up into their own OUs by department in a logical hierarchy (site - users - departmentname) and typically an employee will never print to anything beyond a couple of printers, so I'd like to only present them the printers they use. \n\nDavid",

Obviously, personal information does not have to be supplied unless someone wanted to PM me. PM answers are fine.\n\n\u2022\tHis/Her Name:\n\n\u2022\tPhone Number:\n\n\u2022\tWhere he/she currently works in the career field.:\n\n*1.\tOn a typical day in this position, what do you do? \n\n*2.\tWhat training or education is required for this type of work? \n\n*3.\tWhat personal qualities or abilities are important to being successful in this job?\n \n*4.\tWhat part of this job do you find most satisfying? most challenging? \n\n*5.\tHow did you get your job?\n \n*6.\tWhat opportunities for advancement are there in this field? \n\n*7.\tWhat entry level jobs are best for learning as much as possible? \n\n*8.\tWhat are the salary ranges for various levels in this field? \n\n*9.\tHow do you see jobs in this field changing in the future?\n \n*10.\tIs there a demand for people in this occupation? \n\n*11.\tWhat special advice would you give a person entering this field? \n\n*12.\tWhat types of training do companies offer persons entering this field? \n\n*13.\tWhat are the basic prerequisites for jobs in this field? \n\n*14.\tWhich professional journals and organizations would help me learn more about this field? \n\n*16.\tFrom your perspective, what are the problems you see working in this field?\n \n*17.\tIf you could do things all over again, would you choose the same path for yourself?

A couple of applications are stored on this fileserver as well. We have a couple of people who work on shifts during day and night and who are heavy consumers of these applications. The Applications are Java based. \n\nProblem:\n\nMostly during the night, although we haven't gotten a exact time frame from our users, Desktop Icons vanish and the fileserver based applications crash. A log of and log back on restores these connections within 5-10 minutes (this is how long the log off and log on procedure takes). \n\nI am normally logged on during the night as well, but tonight was the first time that my icons disappeared as well. \n\nI am having a hard time tracing down this issue. I wanted to check if the smb connections to the fileshare sometimes gets dropped, we thought it may have something to due with the VEEAM backup. A fellow sysadmin switched the backup off for a night and no issues were reported. \n\nQuestion: \nDo you have a tip how I could troubleshoot this in an all windows shop (no linux, no wireshark). \n\nDo you know of a tool, preferably a powershell script, that could establish and monitor the state of a SMB connection continuously? \n\nDo you think its not the fileserver but maybe some other component?

We have disconnected the old one wand waited and it will not work. The provider L3 says that it is working on their end and hasn't been much help. Now the new MPLS is MPLS IP VPN, not sure if that is what is causing the issue. I know we could have them reconfigure the MPLS and put it on a different subnet and we would have to change the Virginia office to a different subnet and then use both sites firewalls to route but I would rather not unless there is no other way.\n\nMy contractor said that is was an arp issue, and to have L3 make sure it is passing arp info, if we manually bypass arp we can get one machine here to route through the new MPLS.\n\nAny tips would be greatly appreciated.",

I have been setting up a lab at home, messing about with Failover Clustering and all that fun stuff. \n\nI do have a complex server infrastructure setup on my host machine, consisting of THREE private Hyper-V VM switches corresponding to the 3 sites setup in AD Site and Services. \n\nSite 1 - 192.168.1.0/24\nSite 2 - 192.168.2.0/24\nSite 3 - 192.168.3.0/24\n\nI am messing about with just configuring Site 1 for Failover at the moment, but have hit a bit of a snag. I have configured a cluster with two nodes (bare in mind it is a complete 2016 infrastructure, apart from 2008 R2 routers to link all the sites) \n\nI have configured both cluster nodes; Cluster1 and Cluster2 from the host using the Set-VMProcessor PS cmdlet to enable Nested Virtualization. \n\nSo, I go ahead and install a 2016 VM on the cluster, the install is successful. Now, I have issues with the networking...\n\nOn both cluster nodes in Hyper-V manager, I assign a External switch to the Hyper-V adapter on both cluster nodes, and add that network adapter to the VM on the cluster (Hopefully not confusing)\n\nSo I configure the IP addresses and DNS entries to the VM, however I get no response when I ping anything. I have tried changing the Private Switches to External and Internal but to no avail, I've also tried it with the Switch on the Cluster nodes as well but nope. \n\nI'm confused as to why it isn't working, has anyone had any experiences with this yet? \n\nDon't be afraid to ask questions, I've probably explained it terribly. \n\nThanks in advance.

            "selftext": "Hey guys,\n\nmy company uses a Windows Server 2012R2 Terminal Server with the latest patches installed. The server is virtualized on a 2012R2 Hyper-V and has 32GB of vRAM. There are some 20 users concurrent, who consume a total amount of 8 to 10GB of RAM, because they only use Word/Excel and Outlook. The overall system usage is pretty low. The users are connected via RDP.\n\nI'm currently confronted with the following issue:\nThe server crashes two times a day in the time between 11:40 - 12:00am and between 3:40 - 4:00pm. All useres lose their RDP connections to the server and I cannot login via RDP or the Hyper-V terminal.\n\nAfter waiting and monitoring the system usage and processes, I found out that the process \"tabla.exe\" starts to fill the RAM till the maximum of 32GB is reached. Then, after a couple of seconds, the server is not able to fulfill RDP requests and disconnects the clients. After several minutes the process closes itself, thus causing to free the RAM and everything works fine again. When the error accured, I killed the process by myself, cousing the server to run smooth again.\n\nI googled for this problem and I only found strange/bogus websites (www.pcnoerrors.com, www.dllfixis.com, www.wooutilities.com, etc.) with downloads, but I don't trust them, as they look pretty shitty and have no reputation.\n\nHas anyone of you ever encountered this problem? What does tabla.exe do? Can anyone help me?\n\nEDIT:\n\nSolved! (thx /u/m1kkel84)\n\nI couldn't find the exact application on the server, but I found a crash dump folder in the AppData of one of the users. The folder contained \"Report.wer\", which stated the following\n\n    Version=1\n    EventType=APPCRASH\n    [...]\n    NsAppName=tabla.exe\n    [...]\n    LoadedModule[0]=C:\\Users\\_the_user_\\Documents\\tabla (003)\\tabla.exe\n    LoadedModule[1]=C:\\Windows\\SYSTEM32\\ntdll.dll\n    LoadedModule[2]=C:\\Windows\\system32\\KERNEL32.DLL\n    LoadedModule[3]=C:\\Windows\\system32\\KERNELBASE.dll\n    [...]\n    ConsentKey=APPCRASH\n    AppName=tabla.exe\n    AppPath=C:\\Users\\_the_user_\\Documents\\tabla (003)\\tabla.exe\n    NsPartner=windows\n    NsGroup=windows8\n\nI called the user today and she used the software to order data from an unformated file to CSV. Her son wrote it and yeah... Maybe he should improve his programming skills. I told her to stop using the software immediately. No crashes as of now. I'm still wondering why the process was still running and causing trouble between the stated times, as the user didn't use the software after the first crash accured last week.\n\nThanks for all the replies!",

            "selftext": "So a long story short - company I am contracted with relies VERY heavily on their email... which right now is actually a single free gmail account (well, there actually are like 4 gmail accounts but 3 of them just resend everything to the main one). That's official company emails at least, there are also god knows how many unofficial ones and I heard they want to hire more people. So in short - it's a logistic nightmare with hundreds of emails flying without purpose, they actually have tabs inside gmail for employees to which they manually move emails (there are some filters too). \n\nThey also rely on a custom built CRM system (which I am actually developing). One of their dreams is to integrate it more tightly with their email (so it can automatically inform them of new sales, questions from clients, be capable of at least giving them a direct link to said email visible from the application, ability to send an email response directly from CRM) etc. They also want a real control over their emails - for instance creating shared email directories, limiting employee access, adding \"notes\" to emails etc. Which, from what I know, Exchange+online version of Outlook (doesn't have to be online either, it's Windows mostly environment) allows for easily. Or at least it will be much easier than rewriting from scratch inside said CRM.\n\nMy quick skimming also showed that Exchange actually offers an API (currently whole integration between CRM and gmail goes via IMAP and some REALLY ugly code as expected) which could make whole process much easier. Now, I am not a sysadmin - while I can spin a hosted exchange instance I will probably convince company boss to pay for a pro to do the migration for them and ensure that basic setup doesn't have anything retarded in it. \n\nDoes this all sound like a legitimate use case for a hosted Exchange server? Also how much in terms of  weekly maintenance am I looking at (just basics like setting up a script to auto-remove accounts of fired employees, setting them up mailboxes and filtering rules or is it more like a full time job)?\n\nAdmittedly I pretty much suck at sysadmin related tasks but I am also sure that their current workflow is as far away from optimal as possible hence I am looking for options that would make it more bearable and scalable, Exchange is the first thing that comes to my mind. \n",

I have to wait for up to 5-6 minutes until it gives me any results. I've tried some troubleshooting with indexing, rebuilding it, but it didn't help. Now I've unchecked \"cached exchange mode\" and search works normally, but in general, Outlook works slower than normal. One thing that I found interesting, is that after I unchecked \"Cached Exchange Mode\" some of my shared mailbox folders were gone from Favorites. Any advice on what is causing this whole situation?

My main tasks consisted in Linux/Unix server administration and all possible (web)-technologies involved. While the job was sometimes really stressful, I liked digging into new technologies and the work with my team (which was really great).\n\nLast year I quit the job and moved into another town, because me and my girlfriend didn't want to have an long distance relationship anymore. Today I work in public administration at the new place. In the year since I left, I had to learn all the new stuff, which comes with working on a (mainly) windows based environment. The job is not anywhere near stressful like my old one, instead on the other hand it gets kinda boring from time to time. And theres a lot of bureaucracy which I have to deal with now. As another negative part, there are no real IT professionals here besides me. My two colleagues know their basic\nadministration stuff, but any more complex tasks get either to my or our IT support contractor.\n\nAfter my summer holidays this year, I got a call from my old employer, who wants me back on the team, as they are moving forward and its kinda hard to find\nexperienced employees for them. They offer me a 3 day homeoffice/2 day office presence, about 25% better salary and some smaller benefits (homeoffice hardware, monthly train ticket, place to stay overnight during the office time).\n\nAltough my current job has some benefits like less stressful days, a more secure workplace, friday noon off, I am very tempted to take the offer. I feel more at home in the Linux/Unix world and don't want to loose all the skills I aquired. My girlfriend sure has her doubts about this, but also sees that I could do more and be more satisfied with the new job.\n\ntl;dr\nGot a job offer from my old company with nice benefits. Don't know if I should keep my current secure (but a bit boring) position or move\non.\n\nWhat do you guys think?\n\n",

Yet I haven\u00b4t found what I\u00b4m looking for. Let me tell you the situation of the following two very small businesses A and B - so you can hopefully tell me if it is \"ok\" to do what sounds plausible to me.\n\nFirst:\nIn business \"A\" there are 7 people that work on 12 PCs. They do not have personalised e-mail-adresses. Each of the 10 PCs has a full MS Office 2010 version installed - with outlook connecting to an on-premise-exchange-server with the same user@ domainXYZ -account. This account has \"send-as\"rights for 3 different shared e-mail-adresses.\n\nNow from these 7 people only 4 are allowed (and languagewise capable) to use outlook/word/excel. But these 4 work on different PCs on different days.\n\nIf they now want to switch to Office365 with exchange online - would it be \"ok\" to have 4 licenses installed on these 10 PCs. Or would MS have a problem with that?\n\nSecond:\nIn business \"B\" there are 20 people working - but only 2 persons at the front desk with 3 PCs (one of them in a different house on its premise). From these 2 there again only 1 is allowed to use outlook/excel/word. Would it be ok to have one MS Office365 version installed on these 3 machines? Or would MS have a problem with that?\n\nThx",

Please move it wherever proper. \n\nFor ease of readability: \n\nvDC = virtual domain controller\n\nDC01 = Main domain controller\n\nTLDR; I have been given this giant mess. 2 Domain Controller's, one died, could not demote, siezed all roles to virutalDC. Experiencing many issues with dcdiag. \n\nI have been tasked with bringing this domain back to a functional level prior to monday morning. I was not given any documentation for this network at all, let alone any systems that reside upon it. The previous SysAdmin quit yesterday with no notice. There are over 50+ workstations on the domain, at least 10 of which I need to re-add to the domain. \n\nThe PDC was DC01, however it died recently. (Not sure what happened)\nReplication was not working properly to the DC01 dying, which I'm sure has complicated things. No computers can join to the domain, they receive an error message 'The specified network name is no longer available.'\nI spent all of Friday night into Saturday night working on re-establishing the trust between the workstations and domain controller by creating a local account on the system, updating DNS settings to point to the vDC. \n\nAs for troubleshooting, I am trying to narrow things down. \n\nCurrently when running 'dcdiag /q' I receive : \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[vdc] An net use or LsaPolicy operation failed with error 64.\nThe specified network name is no longer available.\n\nVDC failed test sysvol check: could not open pipe with [vdc]: failed with 64: The specified network name is no longer available.\nCould not get NetBIOSDomainName\nFailed can not test for HOST SPN\nFailed can not test for HOST SPN\n[vdc01] An net use of LsaPolicy operation failed with error 64, The specified network name is no longer available..\n[vdc] failed test netlogons\nCould not open Remote ipc to [vdc.domain.com]\n[vdc] failed test services\n[vdc] failed test systemlog\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nAs for what I have done: \nSeized fsmo roles, removed old server information in dns records and within AD Sites & Services. \n\nChecked the NIC settings, Static IP address and its local IP as primary DNS and localhost (127.0.0.1) as secondary DNS. (I've heard mixed answers for proper settings). \n(ipconfig /flushdns && ipconfig /registerdns && net stop netlogon && net stop dns) (net start netlogon && net start dns)\n\nVerified that the NIC on the DC had the \"Register this connection's addresses in DNS\" setting enabled, \n\nEdit: I have also re-registered using:\n>nltest /dsregdns\n\n---\nFSMO Roles: \n> net dom query fsmo\n>> Schema Master                                vdc.domain.com\n>> Domain Naming master                   vdc.domain.com\n>> PDC                                                 vdc.domain.com\n>> RID pool manager                           vdc.domain.com\n>> Infrastructure master                       vdc.domain.com\n\nAlso: \n\n> nslookup\n> set type=all\n> domain.com\n>>Server: vdc.domain.com\n>>Address: 192.168.1.5\n\n>> Non-authoritive answer:\n>> domain.com     internet address = (external IP)\n\n\n\n\nI believe I have a major DNS issue. The DNS zone was active directory integrated, however it is missing several critical folders such as '_msdcs' and more. I will likely need to rebuild DNS. \n\nI have also used the Port Query utility to help diagnose some of these issues. \n\nEverything passes except for port 42, Nameserver service. I have done tons of searching and can't figure out why this damn thing is not listening. The firewall has been turned off!!\n\nAs of the time of this posting, I have not had much sleep. I am currently drinking coffee in an attempt to wake up some more. Any assistance would be GREATLY appreciated! I would be happy to buy anyone a beer or two that is able to help me solve this. \n\n\nEdit: \n\nI am beginning troubleshooting on dns and attempting to re-create the needed folders on the zone for active directory. \n\nEdit: 09-26-17\n\nDNS is still not fully working. \nI have: \nMade sure DNS was pointed at my server IP, and not 127.0.0.1 (Localhost)\nFollowed the instructions here to delete forest zones from AD: http://cbfive.com/are-your-dns-application-partitions-corrupt/\nRestarted Netlogon service\nManually recreated the zones _msdcs.<forestname> and <forestname>\nfollowed steps here to reset netlogon, and flushdns and register DNS: http://www.experts-exchange.com/OS/Microsoft_Operating_Systems/Server/Windows_Server_2008/Q_27325754.html",

I have never touched the new platform, or drupal, and I'm super weak on php. \n  I love it, it's amazing to explore my way through all of it and discover and implement solutions, but my question is on methodology. Basically I just backed up the old site, set up the hosting, dumped the database and custom files in, and then brute forced my way forward. Anything I didn't  understand, I set aside and moved forward until everything breaks and I'm forced into figuring out the missing pieces. It took a long time. \n  So my question is, how do you all walk into something you know nothing about but have to accomplish? Is there a book or guide or set of principles that detail how to efficiently approach an unknown system like this?\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the detailed responses.

We're at that point where my boss stopped babysitting me and he's pretty happy with my doings. I get a ticket, I solve it as best as I can, and usually never put it off.\n\nI go around the office, ask my senior sysadmin stuff, show interest in our servers, network, VMs but feel like I'm not meant to touch it just yet.\n\nWe're 3 in IT: Sec guy, sysadmin, and I.\n\nThey're super great, and very helpful when I need them. They always tell me about the guy I replaced, saying he did X and Y and that when I'll get more experience I'll take over more responsibilities.\n\nNow I find myself kinda getting the hang of everything. I can finish my work before lunch and if I wanted to, I can go on Facebook and Reddit for the rest of the day, unless something comes up.\n\nInstead, I use that time to improve my skills. I have a Pluralsight account and I started to get familiar with MCSA.\n\nI also browse around here a lot and try to pick up even more knowledge.\n\nThe thing is, I feel like everything is in place in our company. Our sysadmin is a beast, and he's amazing at his job. He does everything right, and quickly and I feel like I can't learn from what we currently have because there are just no issues, no systems that need to be replaced, no software to be installed. Only the occasional Netapp installation when we need an upgrade.\n\nWhat projects can I do, learn or volunteer for? What can I improve in work space as a Helpdesk that I wouldn't need the others' help with?\n\nThanks.",

It also uses less power, 77w vs 125w, which is important since this runs 24/7. Is there any reason that the i7-3770 is NOT superior to the FX-8350 I'm currently using?

My very small company that I work for wants a fresh clean install of Windows 2012 R2 on their beefy server and turn it into a demo station with different VMs running on it.\n\nIt's currently got 2x 1TB drives running RAID 1. Now, I know space is going to be an issue and the business said \"no\" to a $70 dollar upgrade to 2x 2TB drives.\n\n~~If I were to partition 100gb of each drive and have just the partitions be mirror each other for the Windows Server 2012R2 OS, is that possible? This would allow me to have more 1.8TB of space for VMs.~~ - Answered thank you.\n\nThe company needs* a lot of space because not only do we run our demos on there but our devs need space to try things out. I'm going to set up sandboxes for everyone as requested.\n\n--------\n\nSecond question: Hyper-V or VMWare? I've worked with both and I feel like Hyper-V is the way to go just because it's integrated. (Knock on wood that installation of roles and services goes correctly). We have the licensing for VMWare but I just don't see a point when Hyper-V is readily available. \n\n\n--------\n\nThird question: Security wise, should I separate the VM network or do a bridged connection to act as if they are on the physical network?\n\n\n--------\n\nEdit: I'm also reading \"The Practice of System and Network Administration\" by Limoncelli, Hogan and Chalup. Good book so far and informative. I'm just here to gather more opinions.\n\n--------\n\nEdit2: Cloud is out of the picture. Per CEO, not me. Not my decision.

Before that I didn't have any Server or Exchange experience but quickly started picking things up!\n\nOur situation looks like this:\n\n* 4 x Exchange 2010, one is main that connects with Cisco appliance and/or TMG for OWA and takes \n  care of SMTP flow, three others are used by users to access their email locally\n\n* TMG listening for two external OWAs - owa.domain.com and owa.domain.old.com\n\n* Cisco Mail appliance that receives every mail traffic first under mail.domain.com\n\n* internal domain : domain.internal (we do have * cert for that)\n\n* external domain : domain.com ( we do have * cert for that + second one with owa.domain.com and \n   probably autodiscover too)\n\n\nMail flow:\nInternet -> mail.domain.com -> Cisco IronPort -> on-premise Exchange 2010 (main one)\n\nOWA flow:\nInternet -> owa.domain.com (TMG) -> on-premise Exchange 2010 (main one)\n\nI see ADFS already working with Azure, now we just want to get Hybrid O365 to connect with on-premise and here fun begins:\n\n1. Do we have to change  certs on our main Exchange server to match external domain or TMG or Transport Hub will take care of that? Right now our setup is internal cert for IIS and SMTP on main Exchange server and external cert on TMG for owa - everything works without a problem now.\n\n2. Every external URL is configured for owa.domain.old.com instead of the new one... Do we have to get new external URLs to work before we can proceed further?\n\n3. Edge Transport server for O365 connection was deployed in DMZ but i see no configuration on it  and no connection with the rest of Exchange servers. Is it required or it should be deployed on TMG?\n\n4. Do we have to use TMG with hybrid deployment or we can somehow \"go\" around it (probably that's why that Transport server was deployed).\n\nAppreciate any answers that can clear my mind on this lovely 90 F Saturday, any references to guides would be awesome too (already looking for something :) )\n\nPS. We might get somebody from the outside to help us with this\n\nHappy Saturday Guys!",

            "selftext": "Hi, all! I need an advice for my upcoming project. I have 5 VMs in Hyper-V server as a source(onsite, in production) , and destination will be my VMWare 6.5 ESXi server (offsite, in a lab). I have Datto appliance (Siris)onsite that backs up all the VMs (onsite).\n\nThese 5 servers are: 1. Domain Controller: Windows Server 2008 R2 2. File Server: Windows Server 2008 R2 3. SQL: : Windows Server 2008 R2; SQL2012 4. Remote Desktop Services: : Windows Server 2008 R2\n5. Webserver: Windows Server 2003\n\nWhen migrating, all server are needed to be upgraded to Windows Server 2016 Standard. SQL must be updated to the SQL2016. Four servers will be recreated from the scratch in order to avoid any potential issues with older settings and such. Current VMs are a total mess, but I need to extract all the useful data from it and upload it in to new servers, leaving all the garbage out. \n\nMy thoughts in general:\na. Export all VMs using Datto, get all vmdk files to my lab server b. restore the VM that I'll be working, one at a time c. Install OS, get the proper roles according to the server purpose \ni. DC: New DC for example can be joined to the domain when the old DC is up, then promote it to DC level, transfer FSMO roles, then demote the old DC. \nii. SQL: Launch old SQL, backup DB. Install SQL 2012 on it, bring in DB file, restore it on the new server, then upgrade it to SQL2016.\niii. FS/Printer: Copy all the files from old FS, take care of proper shares. Install print server role, install printers and deploy them through GPOs. \niv. RDS: This server will be upgraded to the newer OS. This is a regular Terminal server. There is some Access DB is running, and only developer knows what is inside. I have no clue how to deal with it. Possibly the same scenario will be applied, back up access db, then load it to the new server.\nv. Webserver: Using Web Deploy tool I will migrate webserver from 2003 source to 2016 destination. \n\nThis is an overall approach to the process, but I guess I will be having \"lots of fun\" during migration. It might not be ideal. Please tell me your thoughts and recommended scenarios. BTW, this can be completed druing client's vacation, 2 week window when the whole infrastructure can be down, middle of October. But of course I'd like to get as much done as possible before bringing the server onsite. Also, how do I deal with delta data migration? In other words, how do I bring the new servers data to the same level as a source on the cutover night - robocopy, syncovery?",

Typing domain credentials works, but shouldn't that be avoided since it's supposed to delegate these? I don't understand why it would work internally, but not externally. Both methods use the same DNS address.\n\n**EDIT**\n\nNever mind! After checking my group policy *\"User Configuration/Administrative Templates/Windows Components/Remote Desktop Services/RD Gateway/Set RD Gateway authentication method,\"* I realized I had *\"Allow users to change this setting\"* checked. I cleared the checkbox, performed a GPUpdate, and disconnected from our LAN. Connecting the RemoteApp then worked successfully. I even tried connecting from LAN initially, then connecting to a segregated network and the RemoteApp flickered quickly but remained connected, when it used to disconnect then prompt for credentials.\n\nI'll leave this post up (if it's allowed) in case anybody else has this issue, maybe this will help somebody out.",

It runs our ERP database in SQL, the (edit ~~D:~~) E: drive has the DB files as well as backups.\n\nThe other day, I get a PRTG warning that I'm below 10% disk space on (edit ~~D:~~) E:. Upon investigation, I realize that there is something wrong... I currently have 266GB free out of a 1.99TB drive. However, when I search the drive, I only find 553 GB of data. So I'm missing a little over 1TB of free space that cannot be used.\n\n(EDIT: I should add, I searched with SpaceSniffer, TreeSize, etc... same result).\n\nHas it ever happened to anyone? Anyone has any idea what to do?\n\nI have to be careful, because this is our ERP, so I can't just fuck around with it. I'm thinking of maybe restoring the latest backup, but I'm not sure if it won't just replicate the problem. I could always spin an extra 2TB hard drive on the machine and copy the file over, but I'm afraid I'd break the SQL.\n\nSo any advice welcome! Thanks in advance!\n\nEDIT: I figure I should give you guys the resolution : /u/PhalseImpressions put me on track of using chkdsk (why didn't I think of that?), and I was able to see there were files that weren't detected. /u/Amidatelion then suggested to use WizTree, and Bingo: The file magically appeared! A big 1.2 TB file created by SDELETE. Not sure what it's doing there, because I don't use SDELETE on that server (on any server for that matter).

            "selftext": "In this post, https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/71ox6x/ever_feel_like_reimaging_to_fix_a_problem_is/ by /u/PlutoAdvocate I had a lot of people connect with me asking about how I image that it can be done very fast or just for help in general making the process better. Many thanks to Mike Galvin (https://gal.vin) who gets credit for many of the scripts I post, they are either taken directly from him or inspired by him in some way. The process I use is similar, then again setting up an imagine server shouldn't take to much time at all.\n\nStart with the build automation. You should never change your initial process, ever. Make the image in one way that works best for you and your team and go on with that. When you introduce change, you introduce issues. As for the image, use a whiteboard, a kanban something, and manually set up a computer and learn every single step that you have to take, even changing something like a default program. Do it all by hand once so you understand it, I did this.\n\nUsing a script (https://github.com/cdeli/ComputerImaging) to create the automation enviroment is a good start. The only thing you need in a task sequence is your applications for this. So for this I have a task sequence that installs the following:\n\nAdobe Reader DC, Google Chrome, Office 2016, and Dell Command Update.\n\nFor Office 365, here is a nice way to make the XML in one install file (https://coreydeli.com/2017/06/09/office-365-installer-made-easy/).\n\nNow ensure that you set up your pre-application update and post-application update to utilize WSUS (which by Mike Galvins instructions should already have it built into the CustomSettings.ini) This will run updates from YOUR update environment, so you know what is on the computer.\n\nWhen you have your imaging task, you will add your new OS image to the \"Install\" Step. After the install step you will make a new cmd task (if you are doing a Provisioning Package ONLY) that will do the real heavy lifting. In Windows 10 1703 you have alot you can add in a Provisioning Package, I recommend going through it and removing scripts to replace it. Unlike adding the package via windows, this does not hold the profile. This simply applys the profile.\n\nAs an example, my profile names the compute Contoso-IN-%serial%, adds to the domain, configures the WiFi profile, and adds multiple default GPO settings so the computer doesn't need to change as many settings on first load. The GPO and profile settings are the same for a base Windows 10 computer so you can set your basic Windows settings with this if you want. I take this one step further by silently installing Sophos. Sophos cant be injected because it causes it to fail, so in the package it works for some reason.\n\nUsing this I now removed a ton of scripts from what I initially used on computers by using this. This made my end users experience feel more streamlined and a world faster. I am still working on some manual processes but we are set otherwise.\n\nI will be making a full blog post later detailing this greatly.\n\n/u/Zenkin /u/IT_2784628364 /u/kjrhanson /u/jc72303  /u/onenerdyguy /u/abovenbeyond3",

Besides using hosts files on each computer, is there a way to accomplish this goal?  \nEdit: thanks for the upvotes... halp\n",

So now I'm looking what low cost software is available that can copy from a base folder on a local hard drive to a shared folder and deal with any duplicates/naming conflicts.\n\nSo for example on Monday we need to archive the C:\\Logs\\Job1 folder but if on Wednesday somehow they create a new Job1 folder we may want to archive it but rename it to something like \"Job1 Wednesday\" so we don't lose any data.\n\nRobocopy with /move might work but I'm looking if there's something a bit more focused on archiving than copying and that can maybe send a summary email?",

Right now a mixture of digital and IP, but we'll switch to all IP as part of our upgrade. \n\nOur current system in Panasonic, but it isn't well supported in this area anymore, so we're not interested in staying with that product (plus even their new stuff is looking pretty long in the tooth). \n\nWe've had pitches from a Shoretel reseller, and one selling NEC. Both looked good in the demo, but doesn't everything?  \n\nWhat am I NOT looking at? What questions should I be asking?

I then got hired by an MSP through an internship for school. I worked there for two and a half years and after some crazy mistreatment and generally being tired of the toxic work environment, joined the corporate IT circle in more of a relaxed help desk role, that paid A LOT more than the MSP job that I was under-titled and underpaid at. That was two and a half months ago.  \n  \nHad a meeting with our network manager yesterday where I was told that my server and network talents were being wasted in my current role and that he's going to push through paperwork to get an administrative role (title negotiable) for me to take some of the keys to his castle so he can better focus on managerial duties and some of the bigger picture. I am elated at this news (although I am staying cool because its not confirmed or anything). I think im a pretty smart guy who has the ability to wing it and get shit done. I thought I was going to work here for a couple of years to grab some corporate experience and see where I could go from here, but with another potential 20-25% pay increase coming with this admin role if it all comes to plan, I dont have to go anywhere!  \n  \nIts just refreshing to see things change and actually work out in life, hoping that its all approved by may-june next year, I become a full sys-admin in a 200 user corporate zone.

VPP seems to cover that, but what I now need to know is how to manage the phone if it is a company asset and not a BYOD.  \n\nIs the MDM the way to go here?  Basically I want to be able to recover the phone and redistribute the phone if it is in good condition etc.  I have reviewed AirWatch and for the price it looks to cover my needs but I am waiting on a demo and wanted to make sure i have the right questions when that happens.  \n\nThanks in advance!",

How do you all go about introducing a new product or a more productive method to your company?\n\nI have been testing several new applications lately to try and bring our older company to a new age with better production times and ease of use.  The culture here is pretty stuck in their ways.  Most employees have been here for 10 - 30+ years.  Typically, I invite a handful of \"test users\" to help me trial this new product, and send them a simple how-to Word doc or PDF explaining how to start with the basics.  Generally, about 6 out of 10 employees will acknowledge my email and 2 of those will even bother logging in once.  I've been having to track them down and constantly \"sell\" the product via conversation to get any type of feedback and it's usually \"Im pretty busy\".  I keep throwing the \"well, this will save you a lot of time\", but that does not seem to hit a switch in their brains and they just want to do what they're used to. \n\nI've been thinking about making tutorial videos for the users and hosting them on the network for everyone to use.  What are your ideas or methods on herding users to a new product in your environment?",

I would really like to know if anyone can tell me anything about the 3par console menu, as I have been struggling with finding any info online. \n\nThe reason for this is, I work at a company where we sell refurbished IT equipment, and we have a customer who wants to know how many License To Use is activated on a HPe 3par 7400 that he wants to buy from us.\n\nThe machine is refurbished and configured from another company, so I cannot gain access to the machine through normal means, I.E all default passwords have been changed. The only one that seems to work is for the Console menu, and through there I can reset the whole system and run the OOTB procedure, and from what I have read online, at the end of the OOTB procedure the activated licenses will be displayed.\n\nWhat I want to know is: If I reset the system through the console menu, do I then also delete any LTU's that might be activated on the machine ? Because then I don't have any idea on how to obtain any info regarding the LTU's, as the machine is out of warranty and our company would rather not be paying HPe-customer service for something we might be able to fix ourself.\n\nHope any experts out there can give me at least something ! :)\n\nPs: English isn't my first language, so I apologise in advance for any errors",

From what I've read and seen, it seems that I can only use domain, OU, or attributes to filter, except I know for a fact when you first install AD connect, you can use a group. It looks as if once you've moved past the group filtering, you cannot go back.\n\nIs there no way to achieve this? I can't use OU's because we have a specific layout that our security team requires.

If I do this disks automatically failover to the two remaining nodes and any VMs will migrate to the remaining nodes, just what you'd expect.\n\nHowever if I forcibly power off the two nodes I will suffer a Virtual Disk failure, Cluster Manager will say the network path was not found and a 'Get-VirtualDisk' on the downed volume will say \"Majority Disks Unhealthy\". Nothing will bring it back online until the downed nodes are brought back up and S2D repairs and the Disk.\n\nI even thought this might be to do with the Fault Domain Awareness issue from last time and completely wiped all 4 nodes and rebuilt them but still the same issue.\n\nIs it possible that the 3 way mirror is placing a copy on different disks of the same node?

            "selftext": "TL;DR: Is there any way to force VMware onto software RAID? Is there a cheap, reliable, 4-port SATA PCIe x8 card that works with VMware and older motherboards? Is there an obvious solution I'm missing?\n\nI'm the administrator for our college's research network, which is functionally separate from the rest of our campus. This basically means that I'm in charge of helping professors do research, which gets us grants, which lets us do more research, etc.\n\nOn our network, we're in the middle of swapping from XenServer 6 (no one patched it because it wasn't in an HA pool, so patching knocks out half our network) to Proxmox on our primary VM servers. This means no new VMs for anyone until the HA system is back up and running. One of our professors really didn't like this, and insisted on having their own personal VMware server for research purposes.\n\nThe good thing is that I don't have to set it up, only install it and point him at the IP. However, this leads to an issue I wasn't expecting; VMware couldn't see the onboard RAID controller, and the motherboard (some older Supermicro LGA775 or similar, don't have the model on me) wouldn't show any graphics when we put a RAID card in or added too much RAM. This particular motherboard only has 4 PCIe-x8 slots, so there's no way to add dedicated graphics short of cutting up the chassis for a PCI x8 to x16 riser.\n\nHe ordered a new RAID card, but upon reading the specs from it and a lot more cards we found on Newegg, most of them seem to also use software RAID. VMware listed models that were close to what we found, but close /= compatible.\n\nThis leaves me in a very odd situation. The hardware works when used separately, but putting the RAID card and array into the system leads to a black screen. VMware just doesn't like the onboard software RAID (neither Intel nor LSI). The RAID card we ordered is only a letter off the one in VMware's compatibility matrix, but that doesn't convince me that it will work. \n\nFinally getting around to the questions: Is there any way to force VMware into a software RAID array? Is there a cheap, compatible 4-port SATA RAID card that will work with our old hardware and VMware? Is there a very simple solution that I'm missing?\n\nEdit: Thanks for the RAID card suggestions. It looks like that will be the next step if the RAID card we found doesn't work. \n\nAlso, the college does have a site license for Windows, but the research network runs Linux primarily (which is why I was hired). He's also a Mac person, which he constantly reminds me of, and that means he won't even consider Windows. I've tried to insist on Proxmox, but he says VMWare is the Industry Standard, so he wants to use it.\n\nEdit2: The answer was so obvious I head-desked when I thought of it: don't use RAID if the card doesn't work. This is a system that shouldn't exist forever, and probably won't even last the rest of the year. It won't hold mission-critical data, and we can easily schedule nightly backups to keep his precious VMs safe. We can even switch them over to Proxmox (gasp) when that system comes online next week. After all, the system is his responsibility anyways, so he can reinstall it with a new RAID card if he really wants to use his research budget.",

A lot of the job was trying to get into the network through various \"back doors\" and doing brute force attempts on different login names, calling employees and seeing if we could extract their passwords, etc.\n\nMy favorite part of the job was physical penetration testing.  My boss would give me the name of the business and their address and I would do some research and show up to their office and try to make my way inside past security.  My goal was to insert a flash drive into one of their servers, because that's usually enough to fully compromise a server.\n\nI'd say that 9 times out of 10 I could just show up to the workplace dressed in dickies and tell the person at the front desk that I worked for (insert common local ISP here) and they would let me right into the building and give me direct and unsupervised access to the server room.

I do get along very well with my coworkers.  \nThe few meetings we had were quite unproductive as staff fear change.  \nMeanwhile, the CFO understands perfectly that having an ever growing storage with 7 year retention comes at a cost.  \nThe goal would be to guide them towards a folder structure which could provide improved visibility as well as ease of automated archival.  \n\nWe're most likely gonna end up with a \"_Archive\" folder which contains a skeleton of folders to archive where trained users would move folders which are ready for archival.\n\nAny other suggestions ?",

We have two 4TB Western Digital desktop external hard drives as the first step in our back up solution. \n\nOne of these drives sits next to my desk (Call it: Backup) to allow me to back up footage and graphics immediately after shooting/creation. The other drive sits next our Linksys EA7300 router (Call it: FTP) and is plugged into the back usb 3.0 outlet. I have this drive set up to act as an FTP server for our local network. It works great and me and the other video editor have been using it the last couple days to try it out.\n\nI have used the program SyncBack in the past to back up my personal computer to my hard drive. I wanted to use it here at work so that Backup drive on my desk, and the FTP drive by the router sync with each other at the end of the day.\n\nWhen adding the server location in SyncBack it asks me to fill in the: Hostname, Username, and password. I filled in the host name as our ftp://192.XXX.X.X number and then the username and password i use to access the FTP on my computer.\n\nThis does not work, (Screenshot of error:https://imgur.com/a/TVUND) i've tried another program called GoodSync and had more or less the same issue. It seems like either the hostname needs to be a ftp://companyname.com address or something inside of the router is preventing access to the FTP. I've scoured the internet for solutions but cant seem to find a whole lot. I read about people using a dynamic DNS to help solve similar issues, but other people make references to port forwarding. At this point I feel overloaded with information, and would love to get this figured out before the weekend. \n\nI understand that this is probably a pretty rudimentary way to go about this FTP server but its the best we have at the moment. I am open to any and all help! I may not have provided enough information, but I wasn't really sure what exactly else was needed. I will gladly provide as much info as needed.",

However, this technology director was nothing more than a woman with an education degree \"with an emphasis in technology.\" Under her instruction and direction, everything was basically a shit show, and after months of fighting with the administration and me being stuck in the middle of it, she rage quit the job late at night 2 days ago.\n\nEveryone at the school likes me, especially the administration. When I was free from her direction, I was able to run around and fix the majority of issues that had been sitting around for months in a few hours or days. However, now that she's gone, I have basically assumed all of her responsibilities. In addition to responding to support tickets all day (we average 18/day according to my math), I now am in charge of purchasing, administration of the software that pretty much runs the school that I have not used before (Rediker), and may have to teach an introductory computer science class to high schoolers for an hour a day.\n\nThere has been no organization of inventory. Shit is literally just lying around all over the place in the helpdesk, ordered from various accounts from various sources, and I currently have little idea of what it is that we do and do not have. I have a bunch of tickets coming in about issues with the Rediker software that I have yet to go through all the documentation for and learn. I am getting calls from different companies about support tickets that she's opened with them, about problems that I was unaware of. There are many other things as well, as I'm sure you can imagine.\n\nI have a systems engineer at my office that assists me when I need him, and deals with most of the infrastructure related issues, which thankfully there have been none of lately. If need be, I can request another level 1 engineer out here a few days a week. For an hour a day, I get student workers to assist me in whatever way that I find fit. I have migrated all of the tickets from their old Spiceworks account into our company's system (ConnectWise).\n\nBasically: I need some advice. Does anyone have any tips about how to begin organizing inventory and purchasing requests? I can easily deal with the day-to-day \"this doesn't work\" requests, but I feel like I basically need to reorganize everything and implement new procedures about checking in laptops, giving out loaners, tracking inventory, making purchase requests, etc, because no such systems currently exist. I'm open to anything. They went 1:1 with the students and laptops this year, so there are over 1,000 laptops out there in the wild, plus all of the staff machines.\n\nALSO: I'm still getting paid as much as my room mate that pushes carts at Whole Foods for a living. I have a vacation coming up for 4 week days next week, which will give me plenty of time to think this stuff over. How much do you think a job like this is worth in terms of hourly pay? I have some leverage in that I've been here for months and all of the staff love me, and I am very familiar with the day-to-day issues. I very much want to get everything running smoothly for everyone, and am willing to do a lot to accomplish that.",

            "selftext": "Hi all, \n\nNot sure if my previous post is too old for people to view yet so thought I'd make an update as a new post. I will add the update to the end.\n\nFrom my last post:\n\n\nHi all,\n\nI have recently found this sub so I hope this is not off-topic. Basically, I had a question regarding managing PC backups between a team of people (currently 3).\n\nOur current backup system is set to take backups automatically (mostly). 90% of PCs are backed up every month, about 5% are taken weekly with the remaining 5% taken manually. There are roughly 100 PCs on site which is made up of 6 different departments/ areas.\n\nIf a backup fails for whatever reason, then an email alert is sent out to the person who originally created the backup task.\n\nI have noticed that some backups are failing (some for a number of months) without ever being fixed. I feel like this isn't very visible to anyone and it is pure luck that something without a recent backup has not failed. Whilst I could take on the task of managing all these backups myself, I feel like this would be a demanding task that will be difficult to fit into my already stretched work load.\n\nMy current mindset is that this would be best suited to be managed equally among the 3 people (including myself) within my department. A monthly meeting could be organised for the 3 of us (and possibly our manager) to discuss/ audit the current state of backups. We would each have an area to look after and during the meeting would have to answer to why any backups have not been successful (and a plan of action moving forward). I feel like a meeting would put a bit of pressure on us to make sure we are keeping up to date on all of our backups. Currently there is no such meeting.\n\nCan someone please give me some feedback on the above idea? Perhaps there is a better/ simpler way to manage the bakcups effectively that I am missing.\n\nI am currently the newest and least experienced person in the department so I'm not sure if the idea of me \"creating more work\" will go down very well with the 2 others. One of them has 3-4 years more experience than me whilst the other is nearing retirement (30+ more years of experience than me).\n\nAny feedback you can provide is much appreciated.\n\nIf this question is better suited to another sub then please point me in the right direction.\n\nMany Thanks.\n\n\nNow PLEASE READ BELOW:\n\n\nUPDATE: A lot of people were pointing out that we are backing up individual PCs. Sorry for the confusion but this does not include staff/ office pcs. The backups are of servers or standalone PCs that are used to run or provide visualisation of plant processes.\n\nSorry for not being clearer. This backup operation is for a large site containing various manufacturing process. We only handle the plant critical equipment that does not include generic user's PCs. ",

Other customers are on remote sites connected throught VPN, they wouldn't have any problem, the trouble is with those users who are with Laptops connected to random Internet Connections.

I know we can make them auth as local users, but we loose management and we cannot applied users policies on those machines, and i'm not sure if a laptop that did not connect to AD in more than one month is locked out until que changes the password, but to change that pass he needs to be connected to an AD.\nI'm sorry if somethings is a little bit confusing, English is not mi native language.

By the way you all are defending his certifications, its obviously a common practice to pad the resume with the lowest possible version of the Microsoft certification just to get the letters by the name. Only one guy acknowledges the redundancy of including each level of his track in the signature even though the last one supersedes the lower certs.

So because of scenarios like this I don't want to use /MIR on Robocopy. Today I can get to folders like that because of local server administrator.

Additionally, I'd like to ADD permissions from the original location if they don't exist in the new location.

But just to summarize my issue I need to help a company that is located all over the world, isolate US-based sensitive data from domain admins located in another country.\n\nTo build out my example a little, say you are a multi-national corporation with your primary domain being located in another country.  Your US branch has its own sub-domain but primarily it has been managed by admins and policies established in another part of the world.  What would you do in order to prevent non-US domain admins from accessing or having the ability to access CUI data?\n\nIs a separated isolated domain the only solution here? Either on-site with something like ADFS or maybe via AWS GovCloud?\n\nI've been reviewing a lot of documents such as what [Purdue did with REED](http://er.educause.edu/articles/2016/9/leveraging-cloud-services-for-nist-sp-800-171)\n\nIs there a way to accomplish this without creating a new domain?  I was thinking that you could utilize the firewall to just exclude all of the non-US based IPs?\n\nThank you for your time, I'm glad to answer questions if I can.\n\nEDIT - Found an interesting link on Microsoft's website: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/plan/security-best-practices/implementing-least-privilege-administrative-models\n",

I've inherited an existing vsphere cluster in a remote location with no external access and two esxi nodes in a vsphere cluster with no shared storage. \n\nI don't believe switching to VSAN to be an option because I don't have the ability to even touch the servers, much less install a witness. Also there's only two nics hooked up and both are 1gbit. So, I don't think setting up starwind for shared storage to be a good option either. Simply because I'm working with 40+ VM's and I don't want to bottleneck the nics. \n\nSo, I'm relegated to a software solution. I could do galera, but I believe I'm limited to having the qourum majority on one node and if a node fails I've got a 50/50 shot at the cluster faulting. To me, this only leaves master <-> master or master -> slave. I'd prefer the former but from what I've read it's not a good idea unless you really know your DBA. \n\nI'd appreciate any input or personal experience you guys have had that can help me explore options I haven't thought of. \n\nThanks",

Up until then, a few of the senior software engineers that have been with the company since the beginning (2005) have done all the sysadmin related tasks.  After years of talking about it, they finally decided they needed someone to hand these responsibilities off to.  So, I became their very first System Administrator.  Technically it is an executive level position because I report to the owner/president.  Kind of funny to think that is the case.\n\nIn ways, its the perfect job because I have been given the power to do pretty much whatever I want with the infrastructure.  On the other hand, pretty much every employee here is smarter than me.  HAHA.  Meaning, they are all super talented software engineers and sysadmin work is basically a hobby for them.  They do not have a domain, so nothing but local accounts everywhere (yeah, I know).  And every employee that is hired on literally buys whatever computer they want and they set it up however they want.  And pretty much everyone runs Linux as their base OS while spinning up VMs of various OSes as they need them.  There are a few Macs around too.  And still plenty of Windows boxes both desktop and server.  Also, some Linux servers as well for Gitlab and Docker mostly.  So.....a mix of literally everything and I can't exact stop people from spinning up VMs all day long.\n\nI guess what I'm try to get at here is......where do I start?  LOL\n\nEveryone has a different machine for the most part.  I definitely need to spin up a domain controller and get everyone joined to a domain if only for the sake of a single sign-on solution.  Our email is hosted by Google, so no email server to deal with......for now.  Getting an inventory of all PCs is also on my list of tasks to do very soon.\n\nSo far I've pretty much just been taking care of the various systems and little sysadmin tasks like dealing with VoIP issues, updating the website, Windows patches, etc.\n\nI've been a sysadmin since about 2005 but really a computer guy all my life.  I'm 39 years old and got my first computer when I was 12.  I've been around the block to say the least.\n\nI guess one of my main question here might be.......what are some solution that you have used to join and administer Linux and Macs on a Windows domain?  I haven't had much experience with either.  I plan on getting a Mac for my main desktop so I can have all three flavors to play with.  Right now I'm rocking Debian 9 and its working out so far.\n\nAlso......where would you start if you were in my situation?",

I got out hoping to get in to networking. Since it\u2019s what I was best at and liked it the most.\n\nMy First job out was at an MSP, did that for a year. I wasn\u2019t necessarily burned out. I was starting to get annoyed with all the things that people on this sub complain about MSPs.\n\nGot recruited to be an In house VMware admin for a DoD contractor, a lot more money. But the pace is painfully slow. I took advantage of it by starting college, and I get most of my school work at work.\n\nContract is coming up, I don\u2019t have (don\u2019t really want) the VCP cert which is a new requirement, and am starting to get MSP nostalgia\n\nI\u2019m weighing the pros and cons to either go back to the MSP and dedicate myself to growing the company because I know that the owner actually cares about his tech. (Option 2) Or finding another in-house job preferably in networking.\n\nHere\u2019s the problem I\u2019m facing. So far I have been a jack of all trades. I understand most common technologies (except for Oracle, fuck that shit) and am very proficient and resourceful, But now I\u2019m finding that since I haven\u2019t been exposed to certain things it\u2019s hindering me compared to the competition.\n\nFor example in my last interview:\n\u201cNo Mr. Interviewer, I haven\u2019t worked with MPLS, but I have setup several IPsec site-to-site VPNs with routers and firewall, even with multi-vendor devices so I\u2019m sure I could pick it up pretty quickly\u201d\n\nSo anyways, I feel like I need to either accept the fact that my experience is somewhat limited in the discipline I want to pursue and go back to an MSP.\nAny words of wisdom would be greatly appreciated.\n\n**TLDR;** Need to find a new job, I want to be a network engineer, but don\u2019t think that my experience is up to par. So I\u2019m starting to think my old MSP job as the only choice.\n\nEDIT: Looks like the candidate that they picked couldn't pass a background check. So I just got a call from the recruiter for an Engineer job saying they want me ! Looks like /u/OtisB was right. MPLS can ~~suck it~~ be a tricky question to answer in an interview.\n\n",

Some of them are from 2012, so 5 years old.  So we had bought 4 new enclosures and went through the normal thing with Dell: update firmware first, have them come out and wire it all up.  Before they were used, we had one of the original 7k drives die but not kick out.  I call support, assuming it would be a minor thing.  In the end what we found out was, several of the 5 year old 7k drives were all starting to experience errors at the same time.  We lost 4 or 5 in about a week, which dell engineering is telling us because of their age.  Basically what they told us, NEVER let Dell compellent spindle drives get 5 years old.  Never, because once they start failing like this the system may fail to restripe and rebuild and you may lose the disk pool (and everything on it).  Luckily we had new drives that we put in a new pool and hurriedly started moving everything over.  At this point we are ok.  Our Dell account rep is telling us that any system or drive still under support should be totally fine to use and trust.  The Dell techs are telling us that isn't true, and if drives get 4 years old it's time to yank them.  What has reddit experience been with their compellents?",

Background: not looking at the technical differences between RSA and Duo for 2FA, just a sanity check on what I think I'm discovering about pricing.\n\nThe firm I'm with is approx 70 people, looking to grow to 100 in the next 6 months, so I'm looking at Duo vs RSA pricing for 100 people. We'll all use physical tokens to start.\n\nLong story short, based on the estimates I'm getting from various salesmen, at 100 users, the RSA hardware appliance is a better deal than Duo's lowest tier. The RSA appliance bundle for 3 years runs us approx $9500, and Duo service (with physical tokens) runs us $12800 for the same time. The RSA VM bundle is even more expensive at approx $18k for 3 years.\n\nWhat am I missing? All I read about is how much less expensive Duo is than RSA, and I'm not seeing it (for the appliance implementation).\n\nAm I missing that most people run multiple RSA appliances or backup VMs? Am I right in that middle place where enterprise implementations don't make sense but I can't benefit from a smaller population? Is my communication with my salesmen so bad that the bundle doesn't actually get me everything I need for 3 years and there's additional support costs after the first year?\n\nHalp.\n\nThanks.",

We use JAMF Casper suite to manage ipads, IOS 11 just came out, and there's no official way to block any user from upgrading, but it has some features we aren't ready for (thanks apple for releasing the IOS update before the management updates!).  So one workaround was to setup a proxy config file that points the update servers towards an invalid proxy.  We created the file, but when we pushed out the policy to the clients, it was accidently pushed as a manual proxy with a server address of http://proxy.mydomain.com/no_update.dat with no port number.   As far as I can tell, that shouldn't be able to be possible, but yet it shows up on my ipad as a manual proxy with no options enabled for bypassing it.  Therefore, all the iPads it went to are no longer able to connect to the internet for anything, including updates from our device management systems.\n\nI've set up a proxy at the address in question, hoping to get the proxy setting to work so that we don't have to wipe and re-enroll all these iPads, but of course the proxy setting is pointing to a file (/no_update.dat) which is causing it not to work.  I have access to both the internal and external DNS servers for the domain in question, but of course that doesn't help if the proxy client is somehow looking for the page name, and I cannot come up with any other ideas for getting it to connect to a proxy so that they will be able to connect long enough to update the settings at least.\n\nEDIT:  Holy shit, I finally got it with a combination of a wildcard DNS entry (*.no_update.dat) and a squid server running on port 80 (after several packet captures to figure out exactly what it was trying to look up (http://proxy.domain.com/no_update.dat) and what port it was trying to connect on (since the port field was blank in the config that got sent out.)  I've also opened a case with the MDM supplier (Jamf) about having their software validate proxy settings before pushing them, we were looking at wiping and re-enrolling over 600 devices had this not worked!",

All of my work is cloud based though, so I haven't seen an in-house server stack for a long while. \n\n$currentjob is looking for a server blade to go in-house. The server will be running Linux with a series of Docker containers managed by Puppet. I'm not necessarily looking for help with specifications, but rather: \n\n-  What vendors do you guys recommend? Should I go with a Dell because they have 1-3 days delivery?\n\n- Are there companies that sell server blades that are nice and approachable, but maybe a touch more expensive? System76 spring to mind.\n\n- Any other tips? \n\nThe OS and configuration settings are set in stone, though I do welcome your critique.\n\nThanks\n\n",

            "selftext": "One thing I either can't seem to wrap my head around is software deployment. I don't know whether it's my lacking skills, the overcomplication caused by manufacturers (Oracle/Java, Adobe/ReaderDC) or simply the lack of at least basic management tools in the Microsoft Server landscape. Maybe I have illusive expectations regarding this topic.\n\nWhat I basically need is easy, realiable, easy-to-troubleshoot, automated software installation without having to rely on costly 3rd party apps. I know about pdq deploy or lansweeper, but I am hesitant to invest in yet another management software.\n\n### Deployment by GPO startup scripts\n\nProbably one of the simplest three methods to install software. Set up a startup task and deploy that through GPO. In theory. In reality this feels like a hit and miss. Very often the scripts fail, or need to be extremely customized to what you are about to install. If they fail, it's extremely hard to troubleshoot because. Redirecting the scripts output to a log file, especially error messages, I found that close to impossible. In some cases the script doesn't really fail and exit, but prolonges the boot procedure to 5-10 of minutes. The scripts also have to have some intelligence to accurately check whether the software is already installed, which can be quite tedious to write.\n\n### Deployment by GPP scheduled tasks\n\nBasically the same as by installation scripts. Just more complicated as you have to deploy the script on a share, in comparison the beforementioned where it's saved in the group policy share.\n\n### Deployment by GPO softare installation\n\nThis actually works great if you have a working MSI. But more often than not you don't. Getting Adobe MSI's is a pain in the ass, especially because you have to sign some shit documents beforehand and whatnot. Oracle royally fucks you in the ass by asking you a shitload of money for the Java MSI. And in most cases you need not only the MSI, but a MST and MSP file. And for that you need another software called Orca. I have to admit, I never really tackled this topic because it already caused an aneurysm in my brain in theory.\n\n### Deployment by SCCM\n\nNever tried, but from what I pick up here and there, this sounds much easier. And this would be the only 3rd party package I would consider. But SCCM is horribly expensive for a small shop like we are.\n\n### Deployment by chocolate.\n\nNow this sounds amazing. Tried it out. But again, automatic installation relies on scripts that are hard to troubleshoot, if you want them to run during startup. Again, this is third party. And I am a bit sceptical installing software from public repositoriers. On-premise-repositories and creating packages on my own requires me to invest time I don't have.\n\n### Deployment by Powershell PackageManagement module and Chocolatey provider\n\nLove the idea that Microsoft finally ships a package manager with Windows 10 or Powershell 5. But it's basically useless without a software repository equivalent to SLES or RedHat's RPM stuff. And I don't expect Adobe, Oracle and whonot to come together and make it happen.\n\n\n---\n\n\nWhat I wish for is a new Server feature where I can load exe/msi files and deploy them to users of a security group. And the feature should provide (read: ship with) a tool to edit msi settings. The feature should bring intelligence to install software only if needed, or update if already installed. I should be able to shedule installations and have the software automatically reinstall any software that is missing.\n\nNot more, not less.\n\nRant over and out.",

            "selftext": "Hi All,\n\nThis one's killing me and I'm not sure why.  Finally in  act of desperation I'm hoping you guys can help.\n\nWe have the following setup:\n\n- Windows Server 2012R2 Standard Edition: DC/File Server/Print Server  (DC1)\n\n- Windows Server 2012R2 Remote Desktop Services terminal server (TS1)\n\nPrinters are shared out from DC1 and deployed via a group policy configured in the Printer Management tool.  The group policy is dedicated to printer deployment and is only used for that.\n\nThe user RDP's to TS1, the printers are deployed and all should be good but it's not.\n\nWhat's happening is the users are getting many many duplicate printers under Devices and Printers easily a dozen plus.  You can open Devices and Printers and watch printers pop into the list, deleting doesn't help.  They just keep coming back.\n\nUsers can't get their default printer to stick.  I can set this via GP or script but those are terrible solutions and I'd like to get to a root cause/solution.\n\nThis article seems to describe the issue:\n\nhttps://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/ea51c54b-2734-4987-9f4a-a79f755c8153/windows-2012-r2-printers-showing-twice-and-unable-to-set-default-printer?forum=winserverTS\n\nHere's what I've tried:\n\n- Delete the \"Client Side Rendering Print Provider\" reg key.  All the printers seem to show there.\n\n- Turn off: Connect client printers at login in AD\n\n- Turn off: Printer redirection in the RDP client\n\n- Turn off: Render print jobs on client computers (on all print shares on DC1)\n\n- Recreate the printer policy using only defaults\n\nWhile this works short term as in a few days it's not a permanent fix.  A week or two later the massive number of printers comes back.\n\nThis seems to only impact users on the terminal server.  Desktop clients are not impacted.\n\nRunning get-printers gives the correct list.\n\nAny suggestions?  I'm running out of ideas.\n",

We took on a new client who's had 2 previous IT. The 1st one designed their network infrastructure. The 2nd attempted to fix the first ones mistakes. So here is what they have. Some\nSynology NAS's hosting VMware severs, HP servers, and Dell servers. They have some severs on vsphere and a few others on hyper v. Everything is kind of scattered and split into different parts of different servers and synology nas's. We are attempting to cut everything down into 1 server with many vm's and possibly use what they currently have for backups and redundancy. Im sorry if I'm a little all over the place, as I'm trying myself, to figure their infrastructure out myself. We have already put into place the server we sold and built for them. The issue and delay we are running into, is that they have a bunch of GPOs being pushed out, printers and Lord knows what else. This is the absolute toughest thing we've had to tackle so far and the SR technician in charge of all this, has been getting sidetracked from breaking down their policies and figuring things out. So here is my question to you guys... Would we be better off completely starting fresh and building GPOs as we go? I feel that trying to figure everything out will waste time, when instead we could just destroy what they have and start over? By destroy I don't mean delete lol. More like, create what they need fresh. Setup security groups as we go. Move current hv servers into ours. Convert the VMware servers into hyperv and move things around. What do you guys think is best? Have you ever has a similar experience? I can give more information if needed!. Thank you all so much in advance!",

My facility is doing a ton of collaboration with a sister facility across the country, and the current process is inneficient at best.  For proper version control we try to keep only one active copy, and approximately 4 hours to a full day can be spent in collaborating large CAD file transferrs back and forth for a change that takes 5 minutes. \n\nI'm running into a wall on the cost/benefit business case.  The IT Croud is on board top to bottom,  but  the finance guys up the chain are wanting hard cost savings, calling the stated cost-avoidance, and redirected labor \"soft cost savings\".  I can't say we will be reducing manpower or overtime, because the employees will be working the same amount, they'll just be able to work more efficiently instead of twiddling their thumbs waiting on data transfers.  I've factored in machine downtime, but we haven't seen much negative impact yet.  I've factored in storage costs to house previous versions at each facility.  All of it \"soft cost savings\".  It's something we need to be productive and support millions in new business, but I don't know how to show hard numbers and cost savings.\n\nI can show how the project will allow us to do business more efficiently, but business as (inefficiently) usual will continue without it.\n\nDo you guys and gals have any ideas?",

I've worked with AirWatch in a small 1 server environment with 500 users and a Xen Mobile environment with a large multiserver user base. In both cases I've seen reports of users saying they did not forget their PIN but they can't get into their iOS devices. I'm of the mind set that the PIN is protected and can't be changed by the MDM just cleared and people just don't want to admit or forgot that they forgot their PIN. In both environments we have devices that we can not clear the PIN on unless we do a DFU factory reset the MDM fails to clear the PIN. Well in the larger environment we monitored the failures to clear and over the past 4-5 months 60% of attempts to clear the PIN fail and a DFU reset must be done. I have a few questions for anyone else who may know. Have you seen this? Is it even possible for an iOS PIN to become corrupted or is it more likely that these people forgot their PIN due to things like fingerprint logins? Finally is there a way to mitigate or resolve this issue? Thanks ahead of time!",

Do I just go through all the Windows servers now before the old one expires, can I just do it on one and leave it a few days to see if anything explodes?

For the other domains in the org, it is working without a problem.\n\nProblem:  When changing one of the auth domain \"domain.com\" to Internal Relay, I get an error: \"The value: 'smtp@domain.com' is already present in the collection.\"\n\nI've reviewed the email address policies and the auth domain is part of the default policy.  However, it is with an upper-case \"Domain.com\".  Google searches turned up [another instance](http://microsoft.public.exchange.misc.narkive.com/PqJNMS5W/internal-relay-domain-issue) indicating that this could happen with different cases between accepted domains and address policies.  The suggested fix is to update the domains to match the casing across the board then try changing the auth to Internal relay again.  \n\nThe other domains that could change to Internal Relay without issue have matching lowercase domains across all email address policies.  This leads me to believe that this case difference could really be the issue at hand.\n\nI'm a little hesitant to update the default email address policy as it will touch an alias in every user's account.  Willing to try the suggested fix, but only want to do so the right way and only after ruling out other things I can try.\n\nAny input is appreciated.\n\nEDIT:  Updating for anyone who has this issue in the future.  Turns out the uppercase-lowercase difference between the email address policies and the accepted domains is enough to break the ability to change accepted domains from authorized to internal relay.

            "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI have recently found this sub so I hope this is not off-topic. Basically, I had a question regarding managing PC backups between a team of people (currently 3).\n\nOur current backup system is set to take backups automatically (mostly). 90% of PCs are backed up every month, about 5% are taken weekly with the remaining 5% taken manually. There are roughly 100 PCs on site which is made up of 6 different departments/ areas.\n\nIf a backup fails for whatever reason, then an email alert is sent out to the person who originally created the backup task. \n\nI have noticed that some backups are failing (some for a number of months) without ever being fixed. I feel like this isn't very visible to anyone and it is pure luck that something without a recent backup has not failed. Whilst I could take on the task of managing all these backups myself, I feel like this would be a demanding task that will be difficult to fit into my already stretched work load.\n\nMy current mindset is that this would be best suited to be managed equally among the 3 people (including myself) within my department. A monthly meeting could be organised for the 3 of us (and possibly our manager) to discuss/ audit the current state of backups. We would each have an area to look after and during the meeting would have to answer to why any backups have not been successful (and a plan of action moving forward).\nI feel like a meeting would put a bit of pressure on us to make sure we are keeping up to date on all of our backups. Currently there is no such meeting.\n\nCan someone please give me some feedback on the above idea? Perhaps there is a better/ simpler way to manage the bakcups effectively that I am missing.\n\nI am currently the newest and least experienced person in the department so I'm not sure if the idea of me \"creating more work\" will go down very well with the 2 others. One of them has 3-4 years more experience than me whilst the other is nearing retirement (30+ more years of experience than me).\n\nAny feedback you can provide is much appreciated.\n\nIf this question is better suited to another sub then please point me in the right direction.\n\nMany Thanks. \n\n\nEDIT/ UPDATE: A lot of people are pointing out that we are backing up individual PCs. Sorry for the confusion but this does not include staff/ office pcs. The backups are of servers or standalone PCs that are used to run or provide visualisation of plant processes.",

I tried reading the apache documentation but that was not clear for me...\n\nLet's look at this example, \"mywebsite\" is my server, and imagine we have this configuration :\n\n    ProxyPass /exampleA http://mywebsite:8000/exampleA\n\n    ProxyPassReverse /exampleA http://mywebsite:8000/exampleA\n\n* . If I understood how reverse proxy works, when a user types http://mywebsite/exampleA, it will redirect him to http://mywebsite:8000/exampleA. Is that right ?\n\n* . If a user tries to access http://mywebsite/exampleA/sub_ex_A, will it direct him to http://mywebsite:8000/exampleA/sub_ex_A ?\n\n* . What is the difference between ProxyPass and ProxyPassReverse ?

My name is Kevin Kelling and I\u2019m a Premier Field Engineer with Microsoft focused on Windows Server, virtualization, and Azure. Having worked with Windows Server since the NT 3.51 days, I\u2019m excited to have the opportunity to share a major new feature which holds the potential to change how we interact with and experience Windows Server.\n\nPowerShell is such an empowering way to do so many things, but there are those times where we just want to see and interact with a GUI.\n\n> Last week we announced a sneak peak of Project Honolulu which is our new web based interface for Windows Server:\n\n[PICTURE!!!](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2017/09/img1.png)\n\n> More on Project Honolulu in a bit, but first I\u2019d like to point out that it is much more than just a web UI for Windows Server, as it also helps to complete our Hyper-Converged Infrastructure offerings.\n\n> Hyper-Converged Infrastructure (HCI) is essentially where the compute and storage tiers coexist within each host server \u2013 no external shared storage or SAN is needed. Last year Intel demonstrated nearly a million IOPS on a 4 node cluster using Storage Spaces Direct and we are doing more with mirror accelerated parity volumes and more to be announced at Microsoft Ignite.\n\nContinue the article [here!](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/askpfeplat/2017/09/20/project-honolulu-a-new-windows-server-management-experience-for-the-software-defined-datacenter-part-1/)\n\n\nThere will be a technical preview soon, so keep an eye out, and we'll be sure to pass it along.\n\nUntil next time!",

We make a call, the other side can't hear us but we can hear them, and the call gets dropped after a few seconds. All ports that need to be opened are open, and we can't see anything out of the ordinary being blocked. \n\nI am stumped, our telephone team is stumped, and our firewall team is stumped. \n\nEdit: I don't have access to the FireWall myself. We are a two man team, where I do mostly support and the other guy is the \"sysadmin\". I figured he would be able to go in and change anything if he could find it, but he has limited access. Our real network admin is 9 hours behind, so communication is a little slow. \n\nWe use an LG/Ericsson iPECS-100 system. Our firewall was recently installed two Fridays ago. The Monday after the installation we had issues on the firewall, which was due to the phone system going through our backup fiber line instead of the main line we have. After that got fixed we had no issues from Tuesday-Friday. Now this week the problem is back with a vengeance and we haven't found out why. \n\nAll the settings on the FireWall and telephone system are back on our main fiber line, however the operator says that the phone is still trying to access the backup line. So for some reason the phone system is sending out on the wrong IP address. Based on some of the responses the SIP ALG setting should be disabled... however, like I said, nobody in our team can edit this and we have to wait for the guys in the US to wake up and take a look at it. I will update this post with any other additional relevant information as requested.  Hopefully by the end of the day I can update with a solution!\n\nEdit2: u/rkap knows their stuff. Would be a lot nicer if we didn't have to wait for a nine hour difference for support.",

As an entirely FOSS based environment, I've never really had to deal with the licensing side of Windows and it will inevitably come back to me in the event of a company wide Microsoft audit.

I know these things can happen every once in a while so I popped in the key and booted.\n\nI finished some more installs and rebooted again, and once more I was prompted for the bitlocker key.

With DNS forwarding in place, configured, DNS queries from clients internal to domain.com for anything in acquired.com will be sourced from their internal DNS servers. Not all network access will be permitted!!! Some entries on Acquired.com have different results for their internal split and external split I'm told, that said, clients on domain.com need to resolve their external split records in a few specific cases but with the conditional forwarder in place they will resolve their internal instead. Makes sense to me. Without the network access open, it will fail.\n\nA suggestion I was given to resolve this seems impossible to me....Create a forward lookup zone (for A records) for a DNS zone that is already configured for forwarding. Creating forward lookup zone for acquired.com on domain.com, and explicitly adding those entries...\n\nIs it possible to create a forward lookup zone on domain.com for acquired.com if a conditional forwarder is already setup? Even if you could, wouldn't any queries for acquired.com match the forward lookup zone and stop there? Such as creating an A record for citrix.acquired.com in the theoretical acquired.com forward lookup zone to a specific IP, where any other queries that didn't have A records would then pass to the conditional forwarder.\n\nStarting to doubt myself here, but I think this isn't possible to create some sort of override when a conditional forwarder is in place using forward lookup zones.",

We own 2 Windows Server 2008 R2 DataCenter licenses, one for each of those hosts. From my understanding, Windows Datacenter comes with downgrade rights, which allows us to install/activate Windows Server Standard instead activating Datacenter on the guest operating systems.\n\n\nTheir response is:\n> \u201cWe can confirm that Windows Server Environment calculated for the customer is correct.\n> As per the licensing requirement for the \u201cCluster1\u201d, we note that you have ownership of only 2x Windows Server Datacenter 2008R2 (1 proc) under agreement number xxxxxx. \n> Please note \"cluster 1\" has 2x Physical nodes ESXi 1 and ESXi2 with High Availability redundancy feature enabled. In a two host cluster, each Server device must be licensed for all Virtual Machines within the cluster as that is the carrying capacity for each device when one host fails.\n> We can confirm that the ownership of 2x Windows Server Datacenter (1 Proc) 2008R2 can only cover the licensing requirement for one host within the cluster, as there is minimum ownership requirement of 2x Processors of Windows Server Datacenter per physical host in order to achieve unlimited virtual entitlement rights.\n> Therefore, the licensing requirement for the other host in the cluster is calculated and is reflected as 80x Windows Server 2016 Standard Core. Alternatively, the customer might consider licensing the other host with 16x Windows Server Datacenter 2016 Core.\n> As Windows Server Datacenter 2008R2 product is no longer available for purchase, we recommend purchase of 16 x Windows Server 2016 Datacenter Core. Note - Windows Server is currently licensed per core. There is a minimum requirement of 8 cores for each physical processor and a minimum requirement of 16 cores per physical server. Each license pack available for purchase includes two per-core licenses, with each license permitting installation on a single core. Core licenses cannot be shared between physical servers. Please place an order within the next 2 weeks to remedy this shortfall.\n\n\nIs this correct? I have 2 VMware Hosts and each of them has 1 DataCenter license. Yes they are configured for failover but if DataCenter allows them to run an unlimited amount of virtual machines, why would I need to license 2 DataCenter licenses on each host, for double unlimited? If they are wrong is there anywhere else I can turn to in order to get them off of my back?\n",

SCCM will redeploy all the users applications afterwards.  \n  \nWhy re-image instead of installing the next version every six months?  \nBecause in my environment i have 40+ computers with windows 7 that was installed in 2013 on Lenovo T410's still in use (bean counters are evil when they think that hardware should last 10 years, the good news is that we have finally started a hardware refresh project).  Having an operating system life cycle that lasts around six months, from a support point of view, most computers after going through this will have at most a 9 month old install of the operating system instead of the current situation of a 5 year old plus patches operating system.  \n  \nThe biggest gripe I have with Windows as a Service is the fact that every major update does not care for any user / administrator settings, it wipes it back to a clean slate and everything is back to a vanilla windows 10 Microsoft image. Apple and Linux does not do this, and my understanding of Microsoft's reasoning for this is 'Agile' aka whats easier for their developers. (I do understand where they are coming from, with having to replicate customer environments to prove faults for the cumulative updates compared how it was of having a giant matrix of patches to install before they could start replicating the fault)\n  \nThe point of this post is that I want to hear differing opinions and ideas that make me think. I want to learn and consider other concepts. I want to think outside of the box.\n\n",

One of our sites is currently without a WSUS server awaiting approval for a new hypervisor (long story) so it's picking them up from another site. We've noticed that Windows 10 machines completely ignore any BITS throttling we attempt to put in place, and max out the line pulling updates from one site to another. It's sporadically ruining Citrix performance from our datacentre, even one Windows 10 laptop going flat out can impact Citrix performance noticeable.\n\nWhile we also need to look at traffic management in the longterm (currently deploying Zscaler globally) I would really like to band-aid the issue by throttling Windows 10 updates. How do I do this? I can find lots of people asking the question and a few \"this might work\" blog posts, but nothing that's worked so far. Surely there must be a simple way to do it?\n\nThanks!\n\n(edit, where the hell did my \"Y\" go d'oh)",

            "selftext": "Please see bottom of post for how greylisting works. \n\nMy question is, how does the recipient email contribute to the greylisting outcome? The whole purpose seems to be weeding out the fire and forget/scripted email or incorrectly configured MTAs. What I didnt understand is the purpose of the recipient email address in the 'triplet'. \n\nIf an email is delivered to recipient A, it WILL be delivered to recipient B in the same domain. If an email is not delivered to recipient A, it WILL NOT be delivered to recipient B. What's the necessity of the recipient email address in the equation? Outcome seems to be dependent only on sending IP and Sending MTA configuration... \n\nReason for asking is that we recently implemented it and while we see the benefits, we are also seeing delays. ie greylisting being applied repeatedly to same domain (different IPs) and for different receivers. Eg a client sent us an email for 10 users. Client being a multinational, has a massive amount of IPs though which they send emails, greylisting rejected each retry from the domain (different IP) and finally after 4 hours accepted the email.. and it did this for each of the 10 users. \n\nwhat are your thoughts on this? Is the greylisting policy as it stands correct (triplet including recipients?) \n\n\nHow Greylisting works (Wiki). \nA server employing greylisting deliberately degrades mail service for unknown or suspect sources, over a short period of time. Typically, it records three pieces of data, known as a \"triplet\", for each incoming mail message:\nThe IP address of the connecting host\nThe envelope sender address\nThe envelope recipient address(es), or just the first of them.\n\n\n",

            "selftext": "Hi All,\n\nI have a question regarding office 365 and our CSP. We currently use AppRiver as our CSP however my boss is not happy with their billing screw ups. From what I have seen AppRiver is one of the better CSPs out there but currently we do not really use their support enough to justify any cost they are charging us. We are basically just using exchange online right now and I don't see us really expanding past that. AppRiver helped with out migration over 3 years ago with a different sysadmin when I was just coming onboard so I am not entirely familiar with what took place for the migration from on-prem exchange. \n\nI am attempting to decipher the Microsoft documentation on CSPs because I want to understand what ramifications there may be if we attempt to remove AppRiver as our CSP. \n\nsome questions I have are:\n\nDo we own the tenant or does the CSP? I want to avoid a migration if at all possible. The reason I ask is because our tenant is named AppRiverblahblahblah@onmicrosoft\n\nWhat should I look out for when stripping out the CSP from our environment? I want to make sure there isn't any service interruption. I think we would likely get new subscription licenses from Microsoft to replace the ones provided from AppRiver (is there a quick way to swap which license is assigned to all the accounts or do I have to do it manually on roughly 350 accounts)? \n\nWhat is the process for removing the CSP? I know there is the remove delegate admin under Settings -> Partner Relationships but what else am I misisng? \n\nI feel as though AppRiver can still be an asset to us in the future when we finally get into the project of setting up Azure AD. Any other recommended CSPs out there? \n\nAny advice would be much appreciated! ",

This has mostly been a painless move with the exception of yesterday and today when I started to do the pre-migration 90 days out. Some user's not a lot started getting the message below: \n\n\"Your mailbox has been temporarily moved to Microsoft Exchange server. A temporary mailbox exists, but might not have all of your previous data. You can connect to the temporary mailbox or work offline with all of your old data. If you choose to work with your old data, you cannot send or receive e-mail messages.\" \n\nI am pretty certain that the migration is causing that error message as the users that are experiencing issues are the ones with BitTitan errors in MigrationWiz. \n\nAnother issue that is actually major for us is that so far about 40 messages from random users are ending up in Office 365 before we have even cut over the MX record. I did do a txt record so that I could add the domain in Office 365 a head of time. Could that be impacting it. If so what would the great minds of r/sysadmin recommend? \n\nThank you all!\n\n",

Come to find out when this runs, it completely destroys the GUI backup schedule.

I then added this disk back onto the new schedule (which gives you a choice to format and remove all backups, or not format and KEEP THE OLD BACKUPS). \n\nI of course went for the latter (retain old backups). After it made the first new scheduled backup, I have lost all access to my old backups except for the first one I made like 3 months ago. Very very bad news. It still shows I have made all those backups in the total backups indicator, but all the calendar dates are greyed out in the restore screen. Also, I can't even restore the first backup it made 3 months ago because MSbackup changed the volume name to yesterdays date? It says the volume is offline, even though it is the same physical disk and was not formatted. Is it possible I just need to change the label back? The backup disk is like 3 TB and only had half of it used up, so I don't get where my old backups went. I even tried repeating this same scenario on another server, and had no problems accessing the old backups even when it did change the name of the volume, so none of this makes sense and I'm screwed, right?",

            "selftext": "Alright so we have a really awkward situation with two companies with the same ownership, some shared facility space, but on paper totally separate companies.  Some IT folks like me end up handling tech for both companies, even though on paper we are employees of Company A.  The technical layout and domains of these companies have been around forever, continuously band-aided, and I am trying to figure out a plan to fix this mess as best I can for future growth.  We have been using O365 for ages now, and are strongly considering moving every company computer over to Windows 10 Enterprise using their subscription model.  Using Azure AD is also extremely attractive so we can have centralized management of users and devices.\n\nWe have a single Office 365 account that covers both companies.  Company A's domain name is ABC-Co.com, and this is the primary domain on the Office 365 account.  Company X's domain name is XYZCompany.com.  Employees of Company A are set up on O365 simply as user@ABC-Co.com.  Employees of Company X are set up as user@XYZCompany.com as primary, but we keep the @ABC-Co.com email address as an alias in case people get confused on who works for which company.\n\n\nOffice 1 has a local domain set up as ABC-Co.local.  UPN Suffixes have been created for ABC-Co.com as well as XYZCompany.com.  We have employees from both companies working at this location, all on the same domain.  In current tests, AD Connect is operational syncing test users from ABC-Co.local to their ABC-Co.com O365 accounts.\n\nWe then have Office 2, which only contains employees of Company X.  They have a local domain set up as XYZCompany.local.  No connection between AD or DCs between the two offices, although there is a VPN connection between the two locations.\n\nThere are then employees of both companies that live across the country.  Most have laptops which are not joined to any domain due to the fact that they rarely have a connection back to either office.  No real remote management of these computers, which is obviously a huge issue we want to overcome.\n\n\nAt this point I am looking for any advice possible on how to make everything mesh together.  Having the two different companies on the same O365 account seems pretty reasonable to me, but the two separate local domains with a mix of employees is where I am getting lost.\n\n* Is there any hope to using AD Connect to sync employees from two different local domains to the same O365 account?\n* Would we be better off sucking it up and somehow making Office 2 a RODC connected to the domain at Office 1, and having one big happy domain?\n* Is that even a concern when switching to Azure AD?\n* Is it feasible to migrate everyone to Azure AD, then replace our local DCs so that they act as \"slaves\" to Azure?  Seems like they would only be necessary in case of WAN issues, but it would likely make everyone sleep better knowing we can log in to local resources in case of an outage.\n\nAny other advice on things we should be addressing during this process?  I have never had to do any merging or converting of domains before, so this is all new territory for me.  I wish I could somehow start over from scratch, but it seems as though we just have to chip away at what we can.",

Please correct me if I am wrong.\n\nHere is where I am confused. This is an existing Datastore, so I DO NOT want to erase any information on this. The consultant that I talk too said I need to go into Diskpart and disable auto-mount and automount scrub, what is the reasoning behind this? Obviously I don't want the Datastore seeing my server as a potential host, I just want access to it so I can backup the datastore faster.\n\nAm I on the right path for this? This is really my first time running into iSCSI and getting into the SAN, its going to be sweet getting this to work I just dont want to FUBAR it.\n\nThanks!",

            "selftext": "I was tasked with solving my company's \"unwritten knowledge\" problem. We have several offices and while most of the time information flows kinda-OK inside each one, the non-official communications (things that don't go into Product Updates or Company Policy Updates) between offices are often lacking. I don't have this knowledge myself, but I'm expected to find/build the solution (human or technological) for the problem. After some thinking, I think I'm looking for something that I call a \"memo system\": people can write a short message (e.g., \"for the next 48 hours please don't upload files to server X\" or \"if our system's user management screen, clear your browser cache\") and for it  to be shared with all relevant people.\n\nThese memos should have an importance level, labels (for topics) and an expiry date. This is because I expect them to also be read by new employees or new transfers, who would read all Important memos that are still relevant on that date. Kind of like a way to codify unwritten pieces of knowledge. Ideally, as a nice to have, I'd want to have read confirmations (which we don't have in our G-Suite Mail).\n\nI don't want a wiki (which we have), because: 1. items there wouldn't expire (at least not in Confluence or Google Sites). 2. update notifications are very messy (in Confl and GSites). I don't want people to just send emails because it'd be hard to give a searchable extract for new users.\n\nMy proposed \"memo\" system also has disadvantages (e.g. the archive could get bloated if too many things are left as \"memos\" and not moved into official documentation) but I think that it would still improve our current state.\n\nMy question is divided into two parts:\n1. Am I missing an easy existing solution that we can't download/buy/subscribe to? Before I go into a 2 weeks of build.\n2. Is there a reasonable human that I can offer my IT boss for him to suggest to the CEO, that we three just missed?",

            "selftext": "I'll start off by saying this is a problem I've always seemed to have in IT. I'm not good at \"finding things to do\" and when I do find something, it seems like I get overwhelmed by the all of the red tape involved to proceed with it.  \n\nMy role is to install and maintain the \"Network tools\", including perf/mon and automation. I work in a fairly large environment so there isn't really much I can do outside the applications I support. I \"automate\" things, but paranoia from the managers is high so I get to actually run scripts maybe twice a month. Which is incredibly frustrating, because my projects are mostly at a standstill until I can deploy the config changes. My Windows servers are maintained by a separate group and I've automated updates on my Red Hat servers, so there's not much to improve there.  \n\nI've been spending a lot of time studying, and frankly, that's where I'm getting burnt out. I've taken advanced courses for the applications I support, Red Hat courses, and I got my CCNA a couple months ago. I want to *do* something, but there aren't many resources available for labs or testing. We are in the process of building a lab, but there's a spending freeze while the organization is re-evaluating how we purchase hardware and God knows when that'll be done.  \n\nAll of that said, I don't really want to leave just yet. It's the only organization I've worked for that has provided so many training opportunities. The environment is really unique, and the projects I'm working on will be amazing for my resume... as soon as I can actually complete them. Plus, nearly all of my coworkers will be retiring in the next couple of years... which is certainly part of my problems, but it also means there will be a ton of opportunities open to me, and they almost always hire internally if they can.  \n\nSo, how do I stay sane? Or even better, how do I stay productive??",

            "selftext": "Some background: I graduated last year with my BS in MIS. I'm currently working as an IT Support Specialist for a hardware/software provider for a field in the medical industry with about 50 employees (split 50/50 between remote and local). \n\nMy job was essentially help desk as well as supporting clients with the software/hardware we sell. When I joined, my boss was the IT Manager and covered all internal facets of IT. I was excited to join as I'd be able to learn from him.\n\nNow: My boss left for a new job around 2 months in as some things happened and C levels brought in an MSP to handle our internal IT environment and leave my boss and myself to handle customer facing issues. I ended up earning the trust of the C levels and now I have the same access as our MSP to our environment (except Networking equipment, to my knowledge). \n\nThe problem is, I don't have anyone to learn from. I've taught myself Windows Server a fair bit. I'm essentially handling everything in regards to our servers barring maintenance and backups. I've implemented Spiceworks as a ticketing, inventory system, and knowledge base, PDQ for new deployments, some GPOs that I felt comfortable with to increase security and productivity, but that's about it. \n\nWe hired a new IT specialist, but after working with him for 3 months, I can tell he's not IT at all. He worked at a major hospital doing application support, but he can only work on things someone else has done before (so he needs access to a Wiki with guides on common issues). I was initially excited at the prospect of a new coworker who had an IT background so I could learn from him and improve our environment, but he doesn't have anything to teach me, I'm actually spending more time teaching him than my own work. I can't even trust him to create a user in AD without me holding his hand. I have a plethora of SOPs and guides on our KB to do basic tasks but he won't use them, and always comes to me first.\n\nThe MSP we hired is extremely helpful with any requests I can't solve myself, but I still think there's more that could be done. Some examples:\n\nLocal Admins: All new laptops we buy from them have local admins disabled, but on equipment out in the field already, users are free to do as they please. I'd love to implement LAPS, but I'm scared of breaking something on Prod, and I don't have a test environment. I've gotten into the habit of having a separate DA account for myself to RDP into servers where RSAT won't suffice.\n\nWindows Update: I don't believe we have anything like a WSUS server, as Windows Updates seem to be random on all systems\n\nPBX: We use Digium for our PBX, and it's a complete mess. There are so many call rules and time frames that I'm sure we don't use, and I'm scared myself to touch them as I don't want to break anything\n\nI guess what I'm getting at is, should I continue here? My passion lies in networking, but as I've said before, I don't have anyone to learn from. Almost all my skills have been self-taught during my time here. I've been on and off studying for my CCNA R&S, but unfortunately I get distracted with customer requests quite often so that gets pushed aside. The company is a great place to work for, amazing benefits and coworkers, but I feel like I'll be at a stalemate if I stay.\n\nSorry for the wall of text, here's a TL;DR:\n\nJoined when I had an IT manager as a boss, boss left, I'm the sole \"\"\"sysadmin\"\"\" working with an MSP, new \"IT\" coworker hired, concerned with lack of career growth opportunities if I stay.\n\n\n",

So far our anti-virus and MalwareBytes are doing its job and preventing people from getting actually infected by running the macro, but the Trojan has propagated into nearly every .doc and .docx file on our public network drive.\n\nA bit of backstory:\n\nAbout 2 months ago one of our sales guys ventured off to Finland and in the process connected to some non-trusted wi-fi hotspot in a hotel or airport or bar and must have picked this up. Before we had a chance to scan his PC off network for any infections when he got back, the first thing he did upon his return was plug into the network and open a .doc file on our public storage and the chaos just started from there.\n\nOur Synaptic AV is quarantining the files on the server and luckily, no other machine on our network has any more infected files. However, we're struggling to find a method or software to remove the macro from the affected .doc or .docx files. I ran some tests and discovered saving the .doc or .docx file as a .rtf and then saving it back as a .doc or .docx would remove the macro and the file would then be \"cleaned\", but my manager wants a more solid, automated, Anti-Virus software way of handling it, of which I have not found. If any of you (old school) admins have a way of handling this W97M.Downloader trojan embedding itself into .doc files it would be much appreciated. \n\nNote: I'm working off of my own local admin account which is unfortunately not a domain admin and does not have permission to log directly into the file server either via RDC or shell, so if you ask me any questions about the quarantine on the actual server I won't be able to assist.",

I'm a high achiever, non-mediocre worker, and this company is just the opposite. I've complained to the IT Director. He said he knows everything I told him, and hasn't done a thing to change anything. \n\nStarted applying for jobs. At one point, I had 14 applications out and hadn't heard anything. Last week, I applied for a Cybersecurity Engineer position, heard right back (I have Security+ cert) and as one thing lead to another, I just got a written offer from them yesterday. The position sounds really exciting to me, and they are also willing to train someone like me to do the work, so it has a huge opportunity cost. As the company grows, so will I, and they have a really good plan in place for my personal career growth. It's a work from home position, flexible schedule, unlimited PTO, and they seem to be headed on the right track. The company is growing very rapidly according to the CEO. There was a range listed on the job posting, and as they were very impressed with me, the offer is at the maxed out upper end of the range.\n\nThe hard part, however, is that the offer comes in at about $3k less than my total compensation. The salary they offered me is higher than my current salary, but there are perks at my current job like Health Savings Account matching, cell phone reimbursement, etc. that don't exist at the new company. Also included in the security offer is a condition that once I successfully pass two security related certifications, they will raise my salary by $5k. It wasn't specified which party would pay for the certs.\n\nI thought I had an offer from a company I previously worked for in the pipeline, but it looks like that isn't going to turn out. So I don't have the leverage from another offer. This threw a wrench in my plan, because I told the security company I had another offer in the pipeline and needed to some time but that I should know by the end of the week.\n\nPlan A is to email the Hiring Manager (who is also the CEO) back and tell him that after crunching the numbers, I'd be taking a $3k compensation cut, and that it doesn't make sense to me to take a lower paying job overall, and politely ask if there's anywhere we can find another $3k to put somewhere in the offer (salary, benefits, something???)\n\nIf that comes back as not possible, Plan B is to suggest that the company pay for the certs, or at least the first time of taking the test. The certs I'd likely be taking are $400 and $500 respectively, and if I count that as a \"professional development\" perk, I'd be willing to take the position, work really hard to get those certs quickly (maybe 3-6 months?) and then with raised salary I'd be at about $3k more than my current compensation and on a new specialized career path. \n\nAny thoughts? Am I totally out of line? Ideas? Am I missing something?",

I'm fairly clear on how to prepare for the software engineering aspect, but for the systems engineer I could use some advice. The initial screening was all Linux related questions, basically asking what output a list of commands would give and which commands to use to get a desired output. \n\nThe time frame until the interview is uncertain, as I'm still studying so assume I have a couple of months to prepare. Where should I start? **What level of proficiency would a company require from a graduate?** I use Ubuntu as my daily dev environment so I'm not a complete beginner when it comes to Linux, but a lot of the questions in the screening I had to put into the terminal, look up their man pages, Google search etc. \n\nI'm familiar with the text book 'Advanced Programming in the Unix Environment,' but it's quite vast and with my attention currently diverted towards studies, something slightly more digestible or a good starting point in the book would be preferable.\n\nThanks a lot in advance r/sysadmin",

            "selftext": "I have had some pretty good conversations the past few days around a few various topics that sort of bleed into one another.  One of the posts was about how to negotiate more salary, and it really got me thinking about how you sell your ideas to management.  Before anyone tries to chime in with \"*Some tech professionals need more managing, more guidance, don't understand business, etc*,\" for this discussion I am going to assume that you are already decent at this and at the very least have an understanding of this.\n\nOften times you might have a great idea and you don't know how to sell it.  I run into this still to this day.  I can see all the benefits of implementing a new tool, changing our stack, or our process, but if I cannot articulate that in a specific manner often it falls onto deaf ears.\n\nSo here are some things I have learned, in no specific order:\n\n* Understand the business - If you are in say the finance industry you are bound most likely with some hefty compliance, which means you may be limited in scope to build or design something.   Take the time to really understand the business, sit in on open meetings if you can, attend all hands, ask your manager if you are curious about some of the business aspects, they will gladly tell you.  Listen to your sales team, if you have one, they will know a lot because it is their job is to sell.\n\n* Do not be afraid to use the right terminology.  Say you can reduce system provisioning time by 1/4 of the time it currently is with code and automation but no one wants to adopt it.  4x times faster than the old method is a 400% increase in efficiency.  Use the larger number over the smaller one.  This benefits like provisioning systems for new hires, decommissioning and deploying new systems, it can reduce break/fix downtime, etc.  Remember you are making this better.   When you toss a number out like you can increase efficiently by 500% (make it 5 times faster) it can motivate management to listen more.  They can use that in their trajectory or burn down reports or whatever it is they report on to the upper management.  Do not say reduce, say it yielded higher results, say it increased performance by a higher number metric.   Remember you are selling it, so sell it.   When you reduce time it takes to do something or reduce something to be more efficient sell it as a percentage increase.  Call your end users stakeholders, it sounds way more like a business term (because it is a business term).  Tech terminology is often not a good parallel or analogy to the business world.\n\n* use data - while you need to be able to articulate your points properly use data to back it up.  In the previous example of changing major workflows to use code and automation to reduce provisioning time, you can provide the data to prove it.  Use time/date stamps and break down a side by side comparison of what you are accomplishing and how you are reducing labor intensive work to free up time to work on other projects you also plan on improving, and of course automation can be customized and you are reducing human error.  This benefits the business in many ways, but one low hanging fruit is decommissioning and provisioning systems for new hires.  If your Org hires 100s of people a month (or thousands like some large ones do) you cannot have long and complicated workflows to provision a system, or decommission a system for re-use.\n\n* Assess the risks and identify the stakeholders - also talk about this when you sell the idea.  Each person in your org and each customer your Org has is a different stake holder.  Different stakeholders have different risks, and while this does tie into knowing the business, it is important to always think of this.  If you want to make a big change, and while on paper that change is great and would vastly modernize and improve say VPN connections at your work, but there is a risk of some people losing VPN connections and having to get a new cert or something and the failure rate is not acceptable then you are impacting the business too much with this change.  This is where you plan, and do a phased roll out, or a parallel infrastructure migration, or any other option that mitigates those risks into something negligible.  You will get asked these questions when you stand up a proposal to your management, they will ask you the impacts, the risks, the edge cases, and how you can mitigate or work around them.  So you will always need to know the ins and outs and have them ready.  If you don't have these details ironed and you are asked to shelf that idea or improve it and come back do not take it personally, because it was the right decision to do so.\n\n* Sell the bigger picture - If you want to get a license for say GitHub Enterprise because you know it is a great tool and there are many business benefits to it (version control, centralized code repos, robust APIs/hookbacks, integration into many systems, etc) try to look at the bigger picture.  You should sell it as the business should use it, or maybe your team.   The bigger picture in this scenario is that there are lots of actual business benefits to leveraging a product like GitHub Enterprise.  Now getting your entire team or Org to adopt something is hard, and there will be people who resist it, but if leadership buys into the bigger picture they will come around.  If you want to migrate to something that is better, what are the benefits, and what is the road map?  In a year or two can you really leverage this new thing as something that will improve everything?   \n\n* Road map - you want to pitch your idea, can you articulate how that idea pans out 1 year from now, 5 years from now, etc?   If you want to pitch an idea that only short term fixes something and it requires project level work, it will probably most likely not happen.   That is just how it works.  You'll need to have some vision with it.\n\n* never take anything personally - if your idea gets shot down, maybe it wasn't a bad idea per se, but perhaps the proposal was bad, or the implementation was bad, or maybe you made some mistakes and were wrong.  All of these things happen, no one is trying to block you from doing work.  Management is trying to protect the business, so you and everyone else still has a job.\n\nYou do need to shift into somewhat a sales position and you should always try to be able to explain the ins and outs of what you want to accomplish.   I have met people in tech that could sell you anything when it came to their ideas and I have worked with people that had really good ideas but lacked in vision, roadmap, and assess the risks, so their ideas never got developed beyond that.\n\n",

I'm also wanting to get my Sysmon logs to my SIEM Server as well. Because of the ease of deploying WEF, I would prefer this way, but I'm second guessing if this would be the most efficient way.\n\nI know that depending on the configuration, it can be a bit noisy, but with the right tuning, you can filter out some of the traffic. Would I be better off sending that traffic directly to my SIEM server utilizing Nxlog, winlogbeats, etc... or can I keep utilizing my WEF instance?\n\n\nIf it's possible to keep utilizing my WEF instance, I'm having a bit of trouble actually getting my subscription to work for the Sysmon logs. The channel access for the Sysmon/Operational logs appears to be less than the \"Security\" logs as I can only read the \"Security\" logs from an administrative powershell instance, and the \"Sysmon/Operational\" logs do not require administrative access. I'm assuming if I supply my GPO with the \"Security\" logs channel access, that I should also be capable of reading the \"Sysmon/Operational\" logs, but I can not get the server I have subscribed to get the \"Sysmon/Operational\" logs to forward to my central windows server. I've verified that the same server though is capable of forwarding new local users adds to my central server, so I at the very least I know the subscription works for the Security logs on my remote server. So my question I guess is, is it possible to forward the Sysmon logs to my WEF instance, and if so, is it efficient to do that as opposed to just deploying nxlog on my servers to send to my SIEM instance.\n\nHopefully this isn't confusing...\n\n",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone!   \n   \nI want to try and get some feedback before moving forward with some PoC trials. As the title suggests, I'm trying to move from a crappy FTP server (hosted in-house) to something more robust and not hosted in-house.   \n   \nCurrently, we have a machine that runs an FTP Server Application, that has several shares that are open to the local network and those same shares are also \"shared\" via the FTP App. This allows local users to browse, update, etc. the files, and lets Windows sort out locking and whatnot.   \n   \nWhat I would like to do is move those files from this independant machine to the more robust File Server VM, share things that way, and then implement a server in the \"cloud\" that would be the middle-point between our network and the external users who access the files via FTP.    \n   \nI'm thinking about setting up an Owncloud/Nextcloud server on AWS, sticking it mid-way between our office and our external users, attaching a big EBS-Volume to it (for storing of the actual files), and putting the NC/OC sync client on the File Server to sync the appropriate folders. This way, I can keep the files local (for Windows-based locking, multiple tiered backups, etc.) for my office staff, and then keep a copy of those files on a server offsite, synchronized with the client. And then the external users connect only to the offsite server for accessing files and whatnot.   \n   \nI've seen an OC deployment in another department, but that was so poorly executed that it's been shelved and they went back to using *email* to send files across to external users. I know NextCloud is the fork of OC, but I haven't used it yet.   \n   \nAnyone else do something similar to this? Suggestions, pitfalls, recommendations, concerns that I'm overthinking things? Constructive criticism is welcome!   \n   \n**UPDATE #1 (2017-09-19 11:15AM):** My goal is to replace what I have with something new as seamlessly as possible- Right now, our external users use FTP, and trying to convince them to use something else is like trying to teach a fish to climb a tree. This is one of the reasons the prior OC deployment went so poorly.   \n   \n**UPDATE #2 (2017-09-19 11:30AM):** Some of these external users are based Internationally, so any service I choose has to be able to pass through the Great Firewall, etc.",

I'm not exactly sure how it happened, but when I highlighted the contoso.com\\Domain Admins entry in the web client and clicked the \"X\" - it somehow deleted not only all the user and group entries for local and AD, but also removed all of the roles as well.  If I did it wrong, it was stunningly easy to break the system.  Otherwise, that's a pretty wicked bug in the web client (of which I'm not a big fan, but the AD piece can't be done in the C client).\n\nIs there a way to fix this, or am I looking at (best case) recovery from backups, or (worst case) re-installing the system?\n\n(messages about updating to $xyz version are kind, but not necessarily helpful)\n\n\ne: and now it works.  Perhaps there's a lag time in the VSphere-AD interface and I didn't wait long enough before getting worried.  The good news is I didn't panic and start restoration or anything like that.

But, if I decide to define static range for clients to anything else such as for example: 10.94.0.180-200 only external network works, internal is down. Client won't be able to reach any local resource such as printer / file server and so on.\n\nIt is my understanding that when on different subnet, ARP can't figure where to deliver the packet, sends it to public interface which of course can't resolve local resources for the client.\n\nI've tried setting a static route for 10.80, but it didn't help.\n\nHow would I resolve this?

I was the 4th employee brought on as another installer, but always had sysadmin duties tied to my job.\n\nFast foward now almost 8 years and the company is considerably larger and we've outgrown the ancient policy that users can be local admins on their machines.  Eight, even five, or three years ago this worked, but not today.\n\nToday with the news of CCleaner I immediately jumped to action to see if we had any infected machines.  Still being a small shop we lack the fancy tools to do these sorts of check automatically and building scripts or other solutions are beyond my skillset at this time.  I resorted to checking each machine manually.  \n\nAfter i verified there were no PC's with CCleaner I sent an email off to management with a very thorough cost and risk analysis that was associated with no just this vulnerability but how it can apply to virtually any piece of software out there someone may install.  The email I got back was \"I agree, please remove local admin access from everyone's machine\"\n\nI've been wanting local admin gone from machines for years.  Thanks CCleaner for finally making that happen!\n\nEDIT: shortly after the manual verification I realized our PRTG monitoring software could have searched for the CCleaner install directory.  It wouldnt have told me the specific version, but it would have been good enough.\n\nEDIT2:  I recieved a PM asking for a \"sanitized\" version of the email I sent.  Its more of a followup email \n\n----------------------------------\n\nAll,\n\nThis is a good indication of the \u201ccost\u201d associated with local admin\u2019s.  This particular effort took 3hrs between research and validation.  It doesn\u2019t include remediation as in this case there was nothing to remediate.  We don\u2019t have the pricey tools that can tell us whats installed, and even if we did it would take constant auditing for any kind of pre-emptive mitigation.    There really is nothing keeping anyone from installing sketchy software, or even software like CCleaner, which for the most part, has been an industry trusted PC maintenance tool but was infected with something anyway.\n\nAny time a report emerges that a version of just about any piece of software that someone might use, we will have to go through the same process which will only take more time as the number of users grows.  The costs associated with this are:\n\n1.\tIT researching the issue\n2.\tIT verifying if organization is infected\n3.\tLocating infection\n4.\tMitigation of infection\n5.\tLoss of production of user(s) affected.\n6.\tUnknown cost of the impact of the malware on the organization beyond an infected user\u2019s pc\n6a.\tFor instance, if anyone ever unintentionally installed a variation of the crypto locker a good portion of <storage hostname> would get crypto locked as well as it looks for network shares after locking the local machine\u2019s contents. <somewhat important share1>, <somewhat important share2>, <somewhat important share3>, and <somewhat important share4> would all be affected and would take time to restore from either local or offsite backup depending on the scenario.\n\nOur non tech savvy users are not local admins already.  All of our engineers however are local admins.  However, there are a few that aren\u2019t nearly as tech-savvy as they think.  Additionally even the most tech-savvy of people are still vulnerable, myself included.  I've personally advocated the removal of these local admins in the past, but today was a good example of why we should move forward with it.  This email is informational as to the risk associated with allowing them.    \n\nIf you have any additional questions please feel free to ask.\n\n----------------------------------\n",

Currently customers receive their data on request via mailed USB sticks (slow, issues with encryption software on customer's end) or rarely via VPN (issues installing VPN client on customer's notebooks due to their IT policies, issues accessing their internal resources whilst logged into our VPN).

            "selftext": "Good Monday Morning!  I'm here today with Part 2 (of 2) of our Securing Privileged Access for the AD Admin series.\n\nIf you missed part 1, [go read it here!](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/askpfeplat/2017/09/11/securing-privileged-access-for-the-ad-admin-part-1/)\n\nAs always, here's the link to Part 2: https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/askpfeplat/2017/09/18/securing-privileged-access-for-the-ad-admin-part-2/\n\nAnd a snippet follows below:\n\n>Hello everyone, my name is still David Loder, and I\u2019m still PFE out of Detroit, Michigan. Hopefully you\u2019ve read Securing Privileged Access for the AD Admin \u2013 Part 1. If not, go ahead. We\u2019ll wait for you. Now that you\u2019ve started implementing the roadmap, and you\u2019re reading this with your normal user account (which no longer has Domain Admin rights), we\u2019ll continue the journey to a more secure environment. Recall the overarching goal is to create an environment that minimizes tier-0 and in doing so establishes a clear tier-0 boundary. This requires understanding the tier-0 equivalencies that currently exist in the environment and either planning to keep them in tier-0 or move them out to a different tier. \n\n>**Privileged Access Workstations (PAWs) for AD Admins**\n\n>You\u2019ve (hopefully) gone through the small effort to have a credential whose only purpose is to manage AD. Let\u2019s assume you now need to go do some actual administering. The only implementation that prevents expansion of your tier-0 equivalencies would be to physically enter your data center and directly log on to the console of a Domain Controller. But that\u2019s not very practical for any number of obvious reasons and I think everyone would agree that an AD Admin being able to perform their admin tasks remotely from a DC console is a huge productivity gain. Therefore, you now need a workstation.\n\n>I\u2019m going to guess that most of you use the one workstation that was handed out by your IT department. That workstation which uses the same base image for every employee in the organization. That workstation which is designed to be managed by your IT department for ease of support. Yes, that workstation.\n\n>Recall last time we spent almost all our time talking about tier-0 equivalencies. Guess what? I\u2019m going to sound like a broken record. Item #3 from our elevator speech in part one stated \u201cAnywhere that tier-0 credentials are used is a tier-0 system.\u201d What is the new system we just added to tier-0? That workstation. Now, any process that has administrative control over that workstation is a tier-0 equivalency. Consider patching, anti-virus, inventory and event log consolidation. Is each of those running as local system on your workstation and managed by a service external to the laptop? Check, check, check and check. Does it have Helpdesk personnel as local admins? Check. I\u2019ll ask again how big is your tier-0?\n\n>I hear some of you starting to argue \u2018I don\u2019t actually log on to my workstation with my AD admin credential, I use [X].\u2019 What if you use RunAs? That workstation is still a tier-0 system. What if you use it to RDP into a jump-box? That workstation is still a tier-0 system. What if you have smartcard logons? Still a tier-0 system. Some of the supplemental material goes into the details of the various logon types, but the simple concept is \u2018secure the keyboard.\u2019 Whatever keyboard you\u2019re using to perform tier-0 administration is a tier-0 system.\n\n>Now that we\u2019ve established that your workstation really is a tier-0 system, let\u2019s treat it as such. Start acting like your workstation is a portable Domain Controller. Think of all those plans, procedures and systems you have in place to manage the DCs. You need to start using them to manage your workstation. My fellow PFE Jerry Devore has an in-depth look at creating a PAW to be your admin workstation.\n\n>Should your PAW be a separate piece of hardware? ......\n\nContinue the journey [here!](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/askpfeplat/2017/09/18/securing-privileged-access-for-the-ad-admin-part-2/)\n\n\nOne final note from me:\n\n*Remember, security of the environment is the responsibility of the Operations person more so than the IT Security team.  We are in it, manage it, and operate it every single day.*\n",

Hope it's not too boring.*\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI\u2019m in hell, and it\u2019s raining blood. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nI\u2019ve read the supposed horror stories of Lovecraft and /r/sysadmin/ and found them to take the shape of love stories and comedies, in the classical sense when comedy meant happy ending not funny story. This story is a tragedy.\nI\u2019m writing this from my personal laptop, the only object in this dark world that is anchoring my sanity. I cannot use it as a tool in my job; I cannot connect it to the company network, or transfer files from it to my work computer. Such is forbidden. This laptop that\u2019s brimming with the tooling of a modern developer is my gate of ivory. Its desktop wallpaper is \u201cThe Suicide of Seneca\u201d by Manuel Dom\u00ednguez S\u00e1nchez.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe environment I work in is LOCKED DOWN. All hardware devices, peripherals, etc., must be whitelisted; they wouldn\u2019t be recognized by Windows even if you plugged them in. And you\u2019d be breaking security protocol and lose your security clearance, and job, and risk jail. Getting a new peripheral approved is at least a six-month process. The rules, regulations, and suffocating security protocols I must work within, perform miracles despite of, are of a Kafkaian nature. I can read and understand the Dead Sea Scrolls but these texts I can\u2019t comprehend. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nMy keyboard is an inherited pile of human grease and dead skin. The antiseptic I sprayed on it evaporated instantly and made no difference whatsoever. Once a day I turn it on its head and give it a shake, and behold, something new and repulsive rears its head. In my mind\u2019s eye, there is, on a gold pedestal illuminated by crepuscular rays, a mechanical keyboard with blue Cherry MX switches; I keep thinking about it because I\u2019m a sadomasochist, it\u2019s the only possible explanation for why I still work here.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBut the importance of ideal hardware peripherals pales when you\u2019re standing in a river of blood lit by exploding transformers (a common cause of our power outages); when all the tools you have to put out the fires in your world that\u2019s always ablaze are antiquated obscurities no sane man would use.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWith my PowerShell 2.0 abilities, I have created baby Jesuses. I have brought life where you would think no life could exist. With PowerShell, I have parted seas.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThere is no Internet on my network, of course. The only tools I have to make my job easier are the ones I\u2019ve made myself. And all I\u2019ve got to work with is POSH 2.0, and with the luck of the gods, I found a csc.exe (C# compiler), turns out it\u2019s the 2005 version, so it\u2019s 2017 and I\u2019m using C# 2.0. Of course, I have no IDE or proper text editor, so Notepad it is. What about libraries? I scoured my Windows disk for DLLs and threw them all in one folder. To find useful methods, I\u2019m deciphering DLLs even lacking documentation on MSDN. I found a MSBuild.exe, wrote my own build files, and now I have a build system. It\u2019s not a sane (I guess sanity left the building some way back) way to do software development, but ok, that\u2019s what I got. I\u2019m a tinkerer; I can\u2019t even use Microsoft Word without AHK scripts, I make it work.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI have done a lot of challenging programming in my day. But the hell, the torment that has subtracted years of my expected lifespan, that is programming GUI tools and tools that interact with WMI using POSH 2.0 and C# 2.0. I\u2019m not even hired as a programmer here, just something you need to do to survive. I mainly do sysadmin and some tech support. Of course, no version control. Oh, unless I want to use Visual Source Safe, which is by the way, version 6.0, that\u2019s from 1998. Do you understand what I\u2019m up against? They actually use it here.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nEverything here is EOL and EOS and a ton of specially (terribly programmed) tailored software by vendors you\u2019ve never heard of and which we are the only ones in the world using. Googling (on my personal laptop) the Internet is of no help. No one I call will help, \u201cUpdate,\u201d they say. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but we have terminated that product. We can give you a great offer\u2026\u201d So it\u2019s back to tearing my hair out in bloody chunks trying to understand these arcane devices that resemble drawings I\u2019ve only seen in Egyptian tombs. Reading manuals written with goat blood on dried skin.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSee, this is why I swear by OSS. Even if the project is abandoned, you have the source code. You are not ran an unlubricated train on. Which, as a sadomasochist, I guess I should enjoy, but turns out I prefer it with a little Vaseline.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nRoutinely I must do manual labor, like copying installation packages to clients and performing the install myself. SCCM is version 2007 and coming apart at the seams. Our whole software distribution chain is standing at the precipice, down in the abyss I see the souls of those who came before me. All servers are overloaded and routinely freeze up due to massive load and overheating server rooms. No one in our organization seems to understand even the very basics of VM infrastructure and VMs to host ratio. Users constantly pester tech support with tickets concerning poor performance and disconnects, trouble logging into applications, etc. Power failures I already mentioned, and it\u2019s a given they always happen at the worst possible moment (what\u2019s the name of a \u2018law\u2019 for this? Murphy\u2019s?), like in the middle of a personnel evac\u2014and guess who\u2019s on call?\n\n&nbsp;\n\nDid I mention our network spans several countries and is comprised of 25k+ servers and clients, 130k+ users? There are countless systems and applications; all require a different password, I have no password manager. I daily get notifications about an expiring password.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*In closing and absolute sincerity, if this is the last you hear from me, I hope that this post can be a symbol of warning in response to every na\u00efve \u201cI want to be a sysadmin.\u201d Like the bloody and vulture-pecked impaled head of Eddard Stark.*\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*There is an upside to this job. I think. It\u2019s made me quite philosophical as to the nature of man's life. I\u2019ve contemplated and ruminated, as I can\u2019t recall any grave sin I have performed, as to deserve this life, I can only conclude that either Camus was right, and this is my boulder to push, or, reincarnation is real, and I must have lived a heinous previous life.*\n",

            "selftext": "All of our network printers are installed on a Windows server and shared to the network.  We have some users that were recently upgraded to Windows 10 and are now having some issues printing in color to our network printers.  With Windows 7, when they opened the photos app and tried to print something it would load the \"system\" print dialog.  In this case we have Xerox network copiers so it would load the Xerox driver and they could set black and white/color print options using the Xerox driver.\n\nNow fast forward to after they were upgraded to Windows 10 and when they print they get the metro-style print dialog.  It does have an option to set black and white/color settings, but they don't actually work.  If they select to print in color, the document comes out in black and white.\n\nIn other apps like Word/Excel/Etc, they have print options like paper size, etc under the print preview screen, but those options don't work either, instead the user has to click on 'printer properties' and set these options in the Xerox driver itself to make them work.  Since we've been familiar with this issue for quite some time, it seems like this is a similar problem.\n\nWith the Windows 10 photo app I can't seem to figure out any way to bring up the system (i.e. non-metro) print dialog.  I found [this](https://winaero.com/blog/replace-windows-10-metro-print-dialog-with-the-one-from-windows-8/) suggestion, but it didn't help.  \n\nIt seems like this is kind of similar to printing from Chrome where by default Chrome wants you to use their built-in print dialog, but it gives you the option to use the system print dialog for advanced options.  That's what I'm looking for, but can't seem to find.\n\nAny suggestions?\n\nEDIT: Somebody suggested this, but apparently they deleted their comment.

I then do a kinit and I get the lowercase username in the principal:\n\n    [jasbre@machine2 ~]$ kinit\n    Password for jasbre@XXX.YYY.COM:\n    [jasbre@machine2 ~]$ klist\n    Ticket cache: FILE:/tmp/krb5cc_1379946670\n    Default principal: jasbre@XXX.YYY.COM\n    \n    Valid starting       Expires              Service principal\n    09/18/2017 12:14:13  09/18/2017 22:14:13  krbtgt/XXX.YYY.COM@XXX.YYY.COM\n            renew until 09/25/2017 12:14:07\n\nWhat's going on here? I assume it is just something that I'm getting back from the domain controller. Can I somewhere steer this with my sssd.conf file on the Linux machine?\n",

My goal is to attempt a migration and then setup a RODC at my lab at home. I want to practice a scenario like this as I feel it would be similar if I had to migrate from a site to a datacenter. Any help would be appreciated.\n\nApologies forgot to list out the environmental, I've been working in IT and my experience is around 6 years but advanced usage of AD has been 2 years now.\n\nI'm using to test on. So my current lab environment consist of the following:\nWindows Server 2016 (Primary DC) (DHCP, DNS, CA)\nWindows Server 2008 r2 (Secondary DC (DHCP, DNS) / File Server )\n\nMy original lab was a replication of my working environment but has some test users. I plan to do this to my production environment after I've become more proficient. I did quite a bit of research and a normal way to do this would be to do a system state restore onto another hardware device but I don't have that ability due to it being a virtual device or at least I'm unaware how to do this in AWS. \n\nSo as my objective is listed above I currently had one of the 2008 r2 servers as the primary DC. I stood up the 2016 server and moved all FSMO roles over to this server. I've not raised my domain forest level as I plan to use the two 2008 r2 servers for at least another year in production so I would like to do the same in my lab. The documentation for AWS is kind of daunting when your first getting into it which is why I'm trying it out in a lab and also asking for assistance on here. With that said if you need any other information I will be pleased to give it.\n",

            "selftext": "I've been trying all weekend to let this go, but it just keeps gnawing on my mind.  An old supervisor\\friend of mine asked me a few months back to join a new division within a larger company that was attempting to branch out into the Federal space.  My current contract was coming to an end so I accepted, when I was excited to work with him again and he had stated that this was a chance to build an IT architecture with the ability to expand.  What I didn't know at the time was that the reason there was \"room for expansion\" is because the company as a whole actually doesn't have an internal IT Department.  All sources of IT are outsourced to third companies from Exchange to application hosting.  They don't have a domain and all users are given admin credentials on their machines with multiple antiviruses installed (their version of \"hardening\" an image).\n\n\nThey also do not have a Help Desk in any shape/fashion and since we did have a custom application built for this division the day to day \"password resets\" for both the application and the VPN clients and general IT related requests (do you have my home wi-fi password, how do I know if I'm connected to the internet, I broke my keyboard what do I do, etc) have unfortunately fallen into my tasks.  So, while handling maintenance of the application server, building an actual desktop image, trying to build an IT architecture (domain, exchange, file share, etc), assisting with providing continuous security monitoring and equipment purchases I also have to contact users back to answer their questions.  Among the group of users we have independent contractors (1099s) who we contract to do work within our division.  I've found that they're mostly useless since they can pick and choose when they decide they want to work for us, and though the group as a whole is holding onto over $150k worth of equipment (we're required to furnish them with their IT needs, so laptop printer, etc) but they've only submitted invoices for about $4500 worth of work.  A large part of this has to do with their Lead who seems to be a great salesman (he keeps bringing on new people who aren't doing work for the company, but we still have to provide equipment) but he's not very good at managing (hence the less than 5k worth of invoices provided).  He's been in the hot seat now for the last 2 weeks and at first he kept trying to push the lack of work by his contractors off as \"IT issues\".  He stated that they weren't able to log onto their equipment and that when they reached out they were not receiving any kind of communication back.\n\nThis eventually came across my desk and he and I had to have a meeting with our VP where I provided all the data from our ticketing system to show that none of his contractors were submitting tickets for IT assistance.  Without a ticket I have no way of tracking whether or not there was an issue.  The VP agreed with me which got said Contractor Lead in even further hot water.  My IT Manager ended having to get involved in assisting the Lead with creating a project management plan and the lead scheduled an impromptu meeting on Friday to go over everything my manager went over with him.  I declined the meeting invite since 1.) I hate meetings and 2.) my manager would tell me if I needed to know anything.\n\n\nAfter the meeting, the Lead hung around outside my office door until I asked him if something was needed.  He said he wanted to speak with me, so I brought him in as I was eating lunch.  He shuts the door behind me and the following conversation happens:\n\n**Lead:** \"So DarkDoc, you know that the contractors are an important part of this business, right?  I've spoken with the VP and he agrees that they're my time and I'm responsible for them.\n\n**Me:** \"Yeah, I had already figured they were your team.  What is this about?\"\n\n**Lead:** \"Well, I spoke with VP and since I work directly for him to manage this team that means that **YOU** work for me.  You need to do what **I** tell you to do.\"\n\n**Me:** <chokes on lunch> \"Excuse me?\"\n\n**Lead:** \"You heard me.  You work for me and you're going to do as I tell you from now on.\"\n\nAt this point in the conversation, I stood up opened my door and walked next door to see if my manager was here.  He wasn't, so I went back in my office sat down trembling with rage.  I looked lead in the eye.\n\n**Me:** \"I don't work for you.  I work for IT Manager.  From now on, if you need anything you go to him and he'll tell me if I need to work on it.  I don't want you coming in or sending any kind of direct messages to me.  You need to funnel everything through him.  I don't care what the issue is, from now on if you need to speak with someone in IT you talk with him.  Have a good day.\"\n\nI talked with my supervisor afterwards and it turns out that Lead's supervisor (who he was getting his queues from) pulled the same move on my predecessor.  Once I heard that I just kind of shut down.  All weekend long it's been festering inside my head.  It's a weird thing because if this guy doesn't do his job we may not meet numbers for a week, but if I don't do my job (outside of the ticket entries) we lose the contract we have with the government which means the entire division is out of a job.  And somehow, I get the feeling that Lead and his supe think all I do is wait at my desk waiting for a password reset to come in.  \n\nI'm not Help Desk, I haven't been in years.  I've spoken with both my IT Manager and our Director of Operations and they've both kind of laughed it off but 2 days later and I'm still fuming about this.  IT Manager said he'll broach this in an open forum to let them know that I only work for him and no one else, but this doesn't feel like enough.  Anywho.  Thanks for letting me rant folks.",

That kind of reminds me of the many economists who predicted that we would have overwhelming amounts of leisure time in the future (obviously that did not happen).\n\nWhy does everyone think this? Sure if all software stayed the same then of course they could automate almost all of it successfully. But new software always drives new hardware and infrastructure, which in turn drives software, and so on in a cycle. It's not like these shitty SaaS apps are the end of IT evolution.\n\n\n\nWith self-driving cars, fleets of delivery drones, architectural robotics (where the building itself will essentially be a server), the local internet bluetooth-of-hell that's going to be created by wearables, all of this will require people with sysadmin like skills. Why does no one think of this? Am I missing something? I don't know how many times I'm had to explain to a programmer how TCP/IP works, or what exactly a database schema is. Are we really depending on just these people to make the future?\n\n\n\nI'd like to point out I came from a programming background and went into sysadmin / AWS work because I enjoyed it, so I can safely go back, but I just think the negativity I see is a little unimaginative.

I can fake up the rails, but the brackets have me stumped.\n\nYou can see detailed photos here:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/1g93h\n\nThe gist is, the front and rear posts on the netshelter have slots at the corner, spaced 7/8\" apart top to top (the pitch) and each slot is 1/2\" long.\n\nThe front and rear vertical square-hole rails are mounted on these posts with bolts.  The rear rails are typical \"L\" profile with square holes on both flanges.  The front rails only have square holes on the front, nothing on the side to mount.  \n\nThe shelves in question came with brackets (similar to adjustable shelving brackets) that fit into those vertical corner slots, that the fixed shelf supports bolted onto.\n\nThanks to anyone who can identify these suckers and point me in the right direction for getting more.

Our core switch provides DHCP services with different scopes on the different VLANs.  This keeps all our devices separated nicely... until we replaced that core switch.  \nIt still works for all iOS and OSX devices.  It works 95% of the time for Windows clients.  But 5% of the time, when a Windows unit (desktop or laptop) moves from one building to another, it somehow retains it's old IP (which is in the wrong scope and doesn't work).  We traced that old setting in the registry to HKLM\\System\\ControlSet001\\Services\\Tcpip\\Parameters\\Interfaces\\{the specific interface identifier}\\ and in that key are two old settings: the DHCPIPAddress and the DHCPDefaultGateway are both the old settings from the other building.  Clear those and the machine gets the proper IP instantly.  Strangely, the DHCPSubnetMask and DHCPServer keys in this same location are correctly updated.\nWe have watched the switch send the correct IP lease.  We have checked that the VLANs are all scoped correctly.  And it doesn't always happen...  I am at a loss.  The fact that it only happens to Windows clients makes me think the infrastructure is working.  I also turned off 'fast boot'.  And yet I still have the issue.

            "selftext": "Looking through some of the posts here recently got me thinking about my personal experiences.  This is why I marked this as an opinion piece and while I do have a wide variety of experience in the field and I have worked on some very large and successful projects, I do openly admit my experience is anecdotal.  Basically, these are just my opinions to stimulate a productive conversation about the state IT Pros should try to put themselves in.\n\nLike the title reads, \"You are the resident expert at your Org.\"  Your Org hired you to do the things you get paid for.  This means that you are also given an opportunity.  Every job no matter how good or bad, how easy or how difficult is an opportunity to learn.   \n\nOne thing that has bothered me over the years is the term, \"Best Practices.\"  As I have grown with experience and skill, I have come to the conclusion that term can be pointless in many ways, but not completely pointless.   To me it is more of a zero point, where one may start to investigate and implement things.  I have learned from experience that most supplied specs and best practices really never apply to what the end results are.  In fact I don't even dwell on them too much, sans some things that may be pretty true.  When it comes to things like security there are standards you should just use - TLS1.2, disk encryption, solid back ups, etc.   At the end of the day, the data is typically the most valuable thing.\n\nSo what does this mean exactly?   Well I am going to say something that may or may not sound appealing to people, you will need to make the effort yourself to invoke change and grow.  Remember, you are the resident expert, so be the resident expert.   It will be a lot of hard work up front, and there will be steep learning curves at time.  Look at it from a good investment perspective though, good investments take time to build but they pay off in the end.\n\nPart of being an expert does involve a bit of R&D, and your management may not sign off on you spending cycles doing R&D.   They may want you to clear ticket queues instead (which is another thing IT needs to stop, my opinion).  So you may end up investing a bit of extra time into things.   You have to want to do it though, and you have to want to invest in doing it.  Also part of being an expert is collecting data and making decisions based on that data.\n\nI look at the multiple philosophies that different parts of tech invoke.  Devs, DevOps, Operations, all have some really good practices they invoke, and a lot of good philosophies as well.   However, none of them should be mutually exclusive of one another.  You should be able to pull from those philosophies and build your own best practices that makes sense to you and your Org.   Do not be afraid of change.  DevOps is not a fluke, it has been around for a long enough time and has been practiced by so many Orgs it isn't even a new buzz word, it is something that is real.   [Diffusion of Innovation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_innovations) is a real thing, and it is very relevant in the IT Pro field, but not exclusive to our field.\n\nSo, to sum up this wall of text, what are some things you want to do?  What is your road map?  How are you looking at the big picture and expanding as the resident expert?    What are some philosophical changes you want to drive in your job?  What are some technology changes you want to adopt?   Lets discuss how you want to grow as an expert.  I can share some of my ideas in the comments.",

            "selftext": "Have had close to 10 laptops (out of a fleet of 30) experience bad TPM chips that require a system board replacement. Another one this morning.\n\nThe problem presents itself on Win10 machines with Bitlocker activated. User calls in a panic because they are being asked for a recovery key. Once we get back into the machine, windows no longer recognizes the TPM chip. We go into the BIOS and the settings are no longer recognized there either.\n\nWe contact Dell support, go round and round, they send a tech to replace the system board. Problem solved.\n\nBut the rate this is happening at for us is alarming to me. Is this just bad luck or do you think something else could possibly be going on?\n\nThese are different model latitudes, purchased in different years... so a bad manufacturing run is unlikely.\n\nThese are machines in different offices, on different domains, setup and configured in different ways... so a problem with the provisioning process can't be the answer.\n\nThoughts? Advice?\n\nEDIT: **There are no USB-C devices attaching to these laptops, and they do not utilize USB-C docks.**",

How do small companies handle security when there is no local storage, and everything is consumed via SaaS on personal laptops?

You aren't going to find a web administration interface, buzz-wordy superfluous features, or active directory integration. What you will find is a command line driven, flexible, open source, efficient backup/archival program.\n\nWhat you do find in it is the following:\n\n* Saves in highly compressible, windows compatible .wim format. This means you can open archives with 7-zip, mount with DISM, or even take full images and restore with DISM.\n* VSS compatible, so you can take snapshots of live operating systems.\n* Cross platform, you can backup/restore with FOG or from any linux live distro\n* Preserves security and ACLs\n* Portable, less than a megabyte for the whole program\n* Supports exclusion lists\n* Extremely efficient, supports full multithreading\n* Support for incremental backups\n* Can save multiple indexes in the same file to keep things neat\n\nI've done backups with hundreds of thousands of files easily with this program, and I've done image-based restores from both windows PE and parted magic without hassle. It's nice having a program whose backups are so easily accessible.",

            "selftext": "I've seen a ton of people asking about raises and promotions and it seems like there are a ton of misconceptions about how this stuff actually happens. It could be since such a large percentage of this sub is pretty young and doesn't have a lot of work experience.\n\nThe truth is, IT jobs whether paid a really high salary or a low one, are pretty ordinary jobs, and on the whole are going to be treated the same as every other employee at a given company. \n\nThere seem to be a lot of people asking if they can negotiate X, and most of the time the answer is: \"can other people do it?\" and most of the time the answer probably is no.\n\nPeople always reply to these things and disagree and cite some example they heard of, but on the whole most of us (including me) aren't special cases. If you're a special case, you know about it. You're either extremely senior level (think VP) or you're in a job where skills are in demand and there is a shortage of people (site reliability engineer at a startup for example). The typical desktop support or sysadmin person just doesn't fit this.\n\n**Can I ask them to pay for relocation?**\n\nProbably not. You have to be a lot more senior than most of the people on /r/sysadmin, or be an extremely special case. Most of the time this isn't going to happen. Companies don't typically offer this for ordinary employees that they can hire in the city they're in. It's worth asking about, but not something you should really stomp your feet on. \n\n**Can I negotiate vacation? What's a good amount of vacation?**\n\nVacation time is probably not negotiable most of the time because HR is going to track this stuff the same for all employees in a given class and it'd be incredibly complicated for you to somehow have more than everyone else. Sometimes there are minor things you can ask for, like if you start a new job and already have a vacation planned your manager might let you off the hook and just take the days without reporting them or do some other tricks like that off the books. But on the whole, you get the same vacation as other people at your level whether they're in IT, marketing, accounting, etc.\n\nTo find out about vacation and what is good/not good, ask your non-IT friends. This really isn't an IT thing. \n\nMy current company gives me 3 weeks of vacation, more sick days than I actually need, and a few additional personal days each year. It's decent. Meanwhile some crappy companies might give like 2 weeks of time off, which you have to use for vacation and sick leave. That totally sucks. But this really isn't an IT thing.\n\n**What about insurance?**\n\nYou're going to have the same insurance as everyone else at your level across the company, IT or not. Some companies have \"free\" insurance. Sometimes the free insurance is good, sometimes it's terrible. Where I work both the company and employees pay a portion and we can pick between a few plans. It's a good deal. Some places are worse than where I work and some are better, but again this really isn't an IT issue. Talk to your friends.\n\n**Will I get a raise if I get certs? Will I get a raise if I get a masters degree?**\n\nOn the whole, probably not. You will likely make yourself more employable for higher level positions though, internally and at other companies.\n\nA lot of MSPs do actually give raises for certs because they need people to have them to maintain Partner status with Microsoft, Cisco, etc. \n\nBut typically, if you're going to get a raise for these sorts of things, there is a program for doing this and you'll know about it. If you haven't seen this in writing anywhere it's probably not a thing where you work. It's not a thing at most places.\n\n**Can I negotiate a raise in a year?**\n\nMost of the time, no. Most companies do yearly \"merit increases\" which are based on performance reviews. It's not a ton of money honestly, somewhere in the range of 2-4%. It's generally not \"negotiable\" where you have any input. \n\nTo get more than that, your job needs to change substantially (think a new title) and its usually going to take more than a year. The first 6-12 months in any position you're still learning. \n\n**How long will it take for me to get into management?**\n\nThe short answer is probably about 8-10 years from when you start in IT. There are always exceptions and everyone knows \"that guy\" but it actually takes a number of years of experience to see some things. \n\nA lot of the time when you see someone who is like 26 in \"management\" its because he was hired as a junior admin helping a \"senior admin/IT manager\" at a small company, and the senior left and they decided he was doing a good job and let him take over. That's nice and all, but nobody is seriously going to hire him into a management position anywhere else if he was to leave that job.\n\nThis is another one of those cases where if you're a special case, you know about it.\n\n**I screwed some stuff up, but I've been doing better the last 2 months and nobody seems to appreciate it**\n\nTwo months really isn't that long of a time. You have to probably improve your performance for at least a year for it to make an impact. If you got lousy scores on a performance eval, you probably have to wait for the whole cycle to go around and then get a good one for it to count. A few months isn't that long.",

It's really quite cool to be a part of!\n\nFor the competition, they use VMWare images of the operating systems, and each image has a scoring engine that makes a game noise when they, for example, set minimum password length policies, remove unneeded local administrators, configure the firewall, remove malware, answer forensic questions, etc.  The images have different scenarios, usually stating the purpose of the machine, authorized users, etc.  For Windows at least, it seems to mainly be checking stuff you set in secpol, and the state of installed applications and whether certain files do/don't exist.  These tasks are scored and the team's total score is put up on a website where they can see how they rank.\n\nThis engine is rather opaque, however, and the one system that was rather accessible (Pryaxis Jump) is no longer available.  Other options are quite expensive.\n\nI do have quite a bit of programming experience (mostly Java, Python, PHP/Laravel, Bash), at least in University and some various side-projects I've done at work an in my personal time, and 7 years professionally in IT, so I figured - why not do it myself?\n\nThe most important part, however, is scraping the system data - in particular, what I need is essentially **something lightweight, and preferably not requiring a outside server infrastructure, that I can bundle into OS images, which is cross-platform, and can output a useful (CSV, XML, JSON, etc) representation of system configuration on demand: password policies, installed applications, service status, etc.**.\n\nI'm wondering if there may be **some component of a cross-platform configuration management tool that can be used in a fairly stand-alone sort of way to 'grab' this configuration info**, which I can then build my own tools around to parse, score, and graph.  Maybe some part of puppet, ansible, or something?  I've played around with them to a limited extent in the past, but I don't have much experience with any of them.\n",

            "selftext": "I've been working for this company for over a year now. It is a growing startup, and in that time I have gone from first line support monkey to unofficially managing a two man department for nearly 50 staff. I have also taken over the majority of sysadmin responsibilities from our consultant. Overseen moving of offices several times.\n\nI have been pushing for a promotion for a while and have an open dialogue with management as to how I can improve to fit a management role in the company. The feedback and advice provided has been useful and I feel I'm making more changes towards being more communicative, organised and a better manager of my 1st line tech.\n\nHowever, I recently found out they are splitting me and 1st line tech across two offices. A non-IT manager will be managing him and I will be responsible for the first line support again at my location. This is the opposite of the promotion I was hoping for.\n\nApparently it is due to management's dissatisfaction with the IT department's performance. Examples given are mistakes made that have caused email access to be lost in one office for a couple of hours, a PC forgotten to be swapped in after someone else was using their tower at the desk, not being the first person to suggest order of moving staff last office move, etc. I have accepted responsibility for the mistakes and listened to feedback on how we can improve. This being said I think these issues have become less likely than before, but we are dealing with larger volumes of changes and staff so perhaps it isn't appearing that way. \n\nIt is worth noting that I am not qualified and have learned everything on the job and from home tinkering. I am paid accordingly. I agree that we have lots of progress to make to becoming an exemplary team. But I've been told I've been doing a good job training 1st line tech up. I've implemented a ticketing system that I think has helped us cover the additional demand of a growing company. I've written processes for common tasks like new user setup that have improved accuracy. I've learned a lot about networking, postfix and managing the mail server which has saved the company money on consultancy fees. I thought we were making steady progress to improve, but it seems management disagrees. They don't see 'amazing results' as we do not have time to complete projects on top of our duties maintaining our systems.\n\nI don't know how to prove to them that we have become more effective, that I've become a better employee, that our value deserves recognition. Is my attitude or perspective the issue? I don't intend to make excuses but I feel we are doing the best we can with the resources we have. Does anyone else have experience with this kind of situation? I want to stay with the company as I love my coworkers and a lot of aspects of the culture, but if I am getting de facto demotion despite working harder than ever it's hard to see a future there. I don't know how I can continue fulfilling 2nd line support, sysadmin and security responsibilities when I am also expected to do half of the 1st line support.\n\nThanks\n\nEdit: thanks for the honest advice guys I think the reality check has been helpful. I don't have anyone with a higher IT experience to learn off of so this has really made a big difference.",

My boss has found a new job and is due to leave next month, which leaves the position open. I have put myself forward for it but am looking for some ideas and help from people who have went from a sort of SysAdmin role to a Head of Department role. \n\nSo far I am writing out a list of things that I would like to achieve should I be successful, how it benefits the business, impacts, pros and cons. Also putting down how I would restructure the department a little to make things more streamlined and ultimately help end user experience. \n\nMy concerns are that I have never had any managerial experience at all, I have done supervisory roles but never full on managerial. This would be the most senior position I will have held if successful. I think this could go against me when I am in the interview up against people who have more managerial experience than I do. Where I have an advantage is that I know our systems inside and out, I know the business and the purposed direction we want to take in the next few years and also I intimately know the software that virtually runs all aspects of our business and outside of our industry you won't have had dealings with it. \n\nCan anyone who has interviewed for a similar type of promotion or even people who have done the interviewing of someone trying to make that step up give me any pointers? Thanks guy. ",

This provided both redundancy and performance.\n\nNVMe seems simpler in some regards - no more RAID cards, BBU failures, rebuilds...and the performance is brutal. But I'm missing the R-redundancy part of RAID...\n\nHow would you go about providing a solution to the client? Somehow having a single NVMe drive seems risky, even if it's supposed to be more reliable. I've just had some laptop fail with Samsung SSD having bad blocks... Put 2x NVMe and slap linux mdraid or LVM mirror on top? Maybe I'd do that at home, but not in some corporate environment where I'm literally the only one that knows what LVM actually is. Probably lose a lot of performance as well...\n\nAnother idea is, if the client wants to go NVMe way, get a budget for 2x servers, put a single drive in each and build a cluster. Use DRBD with corosync/pacemaker, sync everything and get redundancy for the entire node, not just the storage system. Such a system is complicated, requires more administration (you can't just have a junior admin slap in a new disk and check the web interface if the raid array rebuilt ok) but it's totally redundant.\n\n...or you could just go back to Dell PERC with a bunch of SSD and forget that you could get something like 3x performance with a single NVMe.\n\nAm I missing something here?",

I wanted this to serve a few purposes, a place to discuss concepts and processes in an unofficial capacity, and a place for people to bullshit.\n\nMy major concern is that we already have email, atlassian, and chat, people will probably get burned out on all of these communications platforms. I think it's worth it however because generally on those platforms you only really interact with people in your department. While we aren't a huge company, there are enough of us that there are some people I still haven't met. Chat is great for off the cuff conversation and collaboration, our wiki software is great for cataloging established policy, process, and proceedure.\n\nThe part that I see this filling is a more thoughtful discourse on workflows, sharing of technique and knowledge not restricted by department. For example, I never interact with our accounting group, but if they needed help with an excel script I could probably help in some way. Departments might have overlap that no one is even really aware of. I use the example of the RFC project by the IETF to explain this often. These might be one off conversations, they might build into something that deserves a dedicated wiki page, most people will just post pictures of cats.\n\nI am looking for a platform like reddit, OP creates a thread, conversation surrounding the OP is structured in conversation trees etc. I don't necessarily need the \"subreddit\" part of this, even just based on keyword like hubski. The reason I move away from Reddit is due to them announcing that they are going closed source. If possible I would like to expand it into a more complex platform, but honestly just the ability to create tagged threads would be awesome. The only reason I don't go with a traditional forum software is because I like the comment structure and the asthetics.\n\nAre there any platforms out there like this?",

The VM crash vulnerability in 5.5 was patched on 9/14 prompting this disclosure. The patch listed for both 6.5 vulnerabilities is *ESXi650-201707101-SG* which, according to VMware's [patch site](https://my.vmware.com/group/vmware/patch), is part of 6.5 Update 1.

Using Windows 7 built-in backup & restore utility, we set up about 15 workstations to backup the full system to a NAS drive. \n\nA workstation crashed and for the first time (i know, i know, shoulda tested) I tried to use the restore feature from WinPE to restore from the backups. The machine I was performing the restore on was completely new hardware and of course, after the restore, windows wouldn't boot. It kept rebooting and trying to go to start up repair with no success. It also wouldn't boot to safe mode.\n\nAnyway, luckily I found a spare computer that was almost identical hardware as the crashed workstation and the restore finally worked (thank goodness). \n\nAnyway, I obviously don't feel comfortable relying on the Windows 7 built in back up and restore to handle restoring onto different hardware.\n\nCan anyone offer me some products that I could take a look at? Central management would be cool (but not make or break). \n\nI came across VEEAM Endpoint/Agent for Windows. Seems pretty cool. ",

User is connecting to an Office 365 Exchange Online Plan 1 mailbox. This is one user out of approximately 15 who just received new machines with the exact same setup. \n\nOutlook randomly crashes, but after working with it all afternoon, I can force the crash by switching to the user's calendar every single time. Here are the troubleshooting steps taken so far:\n\n* Deleted Outlook profile and created a new one.\n* Reinstalled Office 2016.\n* Tried starting in safe mode\n* Disabled all add-ins (Adobe Acrobat CC was the primary one I wanted to get rid of)\n* Tried starting with the following switches: /resetnavpane, /cleanreminders, /cleansharing, and /cleanviews\n* Ran the Office Configuration Analyzer Tool - no major errors, fixed the ones that I found.\n* Disabled hardware graphics acceleration\n* Repaired Office 2016\n* Ran PSTscan.exe and repaired errors\n\nAdmin portal shows her mailbox usage at around 14GB, but her .OST file is 3.82GB. Her .NST file is 16MB, but I can't find any reason that might matter.

At this point, this is the only thing I can possibly think of that might be an issue because I feel as if I've exhausted EVERYTHING else. *edit: this just occurred to me - she uses LogMeIn to remotely access her work computer from her personal laptop. She's....a special one (I've mentioned her before) and I cannot rule out the possibility of her working in Outlook on her laptop at the same time she's working in Outlook on her desktop while logged in remotely. Actually, I'd be surprised if she wasn't doing that. Not sure if it's an issue with the different Outlook versions, but I thought it worth mentioning.*\n\nAnyone have any ideas? I'm stumped and this is a massive issue that I don't want to be working on all weekend.

There has been a significant amount of change and growth in the IT department of this company, and I must say that this is one of the most exciting, rewarding, professionally intriguing and resume building jobs I have ever had -- and my boss is one of the nicest, most understanding and helpful managers I have ever worked with.  He trusts our strengths and encourages us to make suggestions where we can (he was, at one time, a teacher, and I learn new things from him almost daily).  Our current ticketing system is the current project I have decided to address -- and it needs it.\n\n#ZenDesk\n\nAs many of you probably already know, ZenDesk has great options and tools for customization, and anything that isn't built into the program is almost certain to be found in their extensions (\"Apps\") which are often open source or free.  \n\nIt is perfect because we are an internal IT department, we won't be billing time or need any of that.  So I wanted to ask, as I'm sure has been asked before, what are some essentials you guys can think of?  One big aspect I am focusing on is being able to run reports to know where and how we are spending most of our time. \n I already have priority, category, macros, tags, incident types, due dates, departments, etc.  I also want to make it as easy as possible for users to submit tickets.  I want to make sure that they can be easily searched for and resolutions can be easily found, and documentation can be created from this.  All of this is obviously while focusing on limiting the amount of time technicians are actually filling out tickets.  I would like to implement project management as well. \n\nSo, what are some essentials that I am missing? Any ideas?  Anything cool that you've added and enjoyed?  Would love to hear some feedback.

Over the last 2 months, we have had an employee from my old company quit every week to move to hopefully greener pastures and more people about to leave (2 more this week). Due to this, our HR department now has more people than our back-end operations department. The feeling around the office is that the company has lost direction and C level isn't properly managing the IT department as a whole.\n\nThis company is starting to feel like a sinking ship and am questioning whether I should stick it out a little while longer or if I should jump ship too.

At the very least I worry about being unable to find another job paying the same.\n\n**TL;DR - This job is stable, but I feel I could grow more someplace else.

Here is my hasty attempt to explain it as I understand it.\n\nThe best analogy I have ever heard to explain how asymmetric encryption works is by explaining that the public key is actually a lock.  I have a magic pad lock (aka public key) that I can copy as many times as I want and distribute to anyone/anything.   Only my private key can open these locks and I keep it very safe.\nSo - don't ever share or lose your private key.  If this happens someone else could potentially use your private key to open all those public keys you distributed.\nSo, in the big wide world of the internet everyone has their own public keys - billions of them.  How do we know who owns what public key?\n\nIf someone asked you your name and address you would be able to say something like John Smith at 123 Pine St. If you were asked this in a casual conversation most people would believe you and that would be that.\nThis is a root certificate aka self-signed cert.  A root certificate has:\nRoot CA's Name - John Smith\nRoot CA's Public Key - my own personal magic padlock\nRoot CA's Signature \u2013  Electronic/encrypted stamp of authentication.  \n\nIn the case of a root certificate you are your own authority.  My name is John Smith at 123 Pine Street and here is my magic padlock.  Don\u2019t believe me?   Well that is where the Intermediate and End-User certificates come in handy.\n\nHow do the police verify your identity? They ask for your ID.  Where does your ID come from? Usually a 3rd party government agency that determines through great trouble that you are who you say you are.\n\nCertificates from places like Digicert are just web server DMV\u2019s that give you a little card with your name, address and photo.  Now you have a third party verifying your identity.\n\nSo a public key is registered to a person, place or thing.  The primary registration begins with the Root certificate.  Third parties then issue you certificates to give you a little credibility as you exchange these public keys.   \n",

Originally we were looking at rockstor too but as it's using btrfs I didn't wan't to invest into that file system especially since red hat recently pulled out of development. For the Synology we would be using ext4.\n\nWe have about 6 TB of active projects but that will increase fairly quickly. We are a post production house so a lot of our files will be footage. We want something with an SSD cache so frequently accessed footage will be available quickly.\n\nThis isn't raw red footage, it's mostly footage that has been down-scaled to what the team will be using (usually 4k or lower).\n\nWe don't really need advanced features, we're going to be managing the share security through a Windows server and be replicating the data to another site in the PNW as well as using that as fail-over so we have some kind of HA if one site goes down.(Management doesn't want to pay to have 2 file servers at each site for HA).\n\n\nFrom what I can tell both Freenas and Synology have all of the features we want so I wanted to know the general opinion of both of these solutions and if there are any other recommendations. What are your experiences with these solutions?\n\nEidt: I've had some experience working with Freenas and we're getting a Synology nas for Surveillance Station use so I'll get a chance to see how it integrates into our current workflow and try to break it some before it gets put into production.",

            "selftext": "See edits below for updates!!! Up to six edits thus far.  To include the exact nature of the DNS resolver everone is asking about.\n\nSo I work for this company that is rather medium sized. I was hired three months ago. It is just myself, and one other Helpdesk guy. When I started, my compatriot told me that The Sysadmin had recently quit after not getting a raise he felt he was due, and it was just us two now.\n\nNow before I sing his praises too much, you need to understand that my co-worker worked with him for a year but knows next to nothing. He stated that The Sysadmin handled everything that came up short of printers. The Sysadmin never answered a ticket that was printer related even if the owners asked him to. Therefore my coworker is an idiot savant. Guy knows printers and NOTHING else. But damn he can swap a fuser in like 5 seconds. But he doesn't know where anything is, or how to access anything.\n\nI am straight out of the Geek Squad and know nothing either. I was just thrilled to have a \"real\" IT job. I still know nothing at all. But the damn place just works. I will give you an example. When my first PC died I asked the guy if there was an image. He said he had no clue, the Sysadmin handled the PC's. \n\nEvidently in this company of 450 PC's The Sysadmin handled installing every one. He then tells me that when one came in, he just took it straight to the user and plugged it in. So I saunter over the users desk and simply plug it in. And to my amateur eyes magic happens. It boots gets an image (from somewhere I had no clue) and boots and all the software needed is there. I assume that the user needs their documents. Nope all there. I have since learned about roaming profiles.\n\nWe just wing everything because everything just works. I have no access to the backup, because we don't have his passwords and my coworker gets an email everyday of the local servers being booted on an Azure server I don't have access to. But everyday the email comes in and shows all 19 servers running on some cloud server. It made me nervous. But at least they are being backed up. I know it sounds horrid, but I simply have no clue how to access them. And I am kinda worried that I took too long to admit it now.\n\nWhen a new user was hired, I googled how to create a new user and found out about AD. Yep, had no clue about that. So I Google how to do it and log into the DC and create his account. I just copy a person from the same department and thank the gods the printers and network shares they need just show up. This is how lost I am.\n\nAnother example is that a battery backup in the server rack started beeping. I was nervous as hell, but when I looked the front of the APC has label-maker tape on it saying the model of battery enclosed and the date it was changed. Again I had to learn nothing.\n\nBut then two days ago it finally happened. Something the autopilot couldn't fix. The firewall died. I immediately was a nervous wreck. I told the owners and they found the vendor from Accounting that sold us the old one. We call the vender and they overnight a new Netgate firewall, and it comes in and I spend the whole day trying to make it work. I am at wits end as I have no damn clue what a NAT (found that word while Googling) is, or even what the WAN should be.\n\nI eventually go to one of the owners, and explain that I simply cant fix this. I have no idea if there are configs saved somewhere I could use, but I simply cannot fix this. I am defeated. I expected to get fired, truthfully. I know I have no clue what I am doing.\n\nHe then tells me he needs to grab something that may help. He then comes back with an envelope that The Sysadmin left. He said that he had forgotten about it. In it is a thumbdrive with a note that says the password is taped on top of the last server rack. Our server room is locked so I assume that it is a secure place to leave a password. I take the drive and then go to the last server rack with a step stool and find an index card with a freaking million character password.\n\nI go to my computer and plug in the drive and am presented with a decrypt password. The drive is only 4 gigs, so I can't imagine anything on it is helpful. But I plug in the password and there is a single txt document. I open it and there is a link with a user name and password. I click the link and it takes me to a private Wikipedia. EVERYTHING IS IN THERE!!!!\n\nThe thing is huge. But in it is all the IP's, passwords, instructions, and everything. It has 1789 entries. Every single device has an entry. I search for Netgate and it takes me to a pfSense page. That page lists everything too. IP's, services, firewall rules all of it. \n\nIt took me two hours but with just that page I managed to piece together a working firewall. I don't know what half of what I typed does, but damn it worked! \n\nI am in awe of this thing. Azure server access, every server, every freaking MAC address is annoted. There is a network diagram that list every single printer, router, access point, server, all of it with IP and MAC Address.\n\nIt even has his ramblings in it on things that he cant figure out. There was an a part of the firewall page that was him bemoaning that the DNS resolver (no clue what that is) wont work with locking down port 53. \n\nI just want to tell the everyone that I would buy him all the whiskey he could drink if I knew where he was now. TC, if you by any chance are reading this...I LOVE YOU!\n\n\nEdit: I realize I am woefully unqualified for even my helpdesk role.  Nor will I be for the next six months (though I do know what WSUS is now...woot!), but dammit I am all this company has right now.  I might not be the helpdesk guy they need, but I am the one they deserve for even hiring me.\n\nEdit2: Update, I sent the thread to management.  They now see that I am not overblowing how incapable I am at being a Sysadmin currently.  We are going to find a Company to bring into to help with the big stuff.  Said my job is safe, and that they would be fine with using a company until I can digest what everything does.  Told me to not worry, and thanked me for being so candid.  I am also required to backup the wiki before I leave today since they now get how important it is.  \n\nEdit3: Welp, I got my co-worker inadvertently in \"trouble\".  Did not think about kind of throwing him under the bus when I pushed this thread higher.  Owner informed him, that he would have to do more than printer support.  Though they appreciated the great printer support.  Told him I would buy him lunch all next week.  He is unaware of this thread.  Thinks I ratted directly, which I knew did.\n\nEdit4: Contact made via text now with old Sysadmin.  He is far younger than I thought.  I assumed he would be an old crusty fogey, but when he asked my age I asked in turn.  Dude is in his 30's.  He invited me for drinks, I mentioned again I am 19 and he said I could have a soda in a sippy cup.  We are meeting in an hour.  My first bar trip!\n\nEdit5: Told owner I was going to meet him.  He gave me a $100 to pay for everything.  Also asked me to change a few things to help hide company identity in this thread.  He is reading every comment.\n\nEdit6:  I keep getting asked about the DNS resolver issue, here is the instruction from the wiki.  I am going to pull from the GUI page (yes there is a command page and a GUI page in the wiki).\n\n***DNS Resolver & Forwarder Below***\n\n1.) Assuming that you have completed the above requirements, first you have to change your DNS on pfsense to OPENDNS. To do this, go to Systems > General Setup. Under DNS Server Settings\n\n2.) DNS Server 1: 208.67.222.222\n\n3.) DNS Server 2: 208.67.220.220\n\n4.) DNS Server Override: Unchecked\n\n5.) Disable DNS Forwarder: Checked\n\n6.) Once you finished, click Save to save all the setting you entered\n\n7.) Once you completed the above process, you need to disable DNS Resolver and enable DNS Forwarder.\n\n8.) I am not sure if DNS Resolver can be configured with OpenDNS/Umbrella, I tried to configure it but no luck. With DNS Forwarder, everything worked well. At this point I really don't care.\n\n9.) To do this, you need to go to Services > DNS Resolver > Enable: (Unchecked)\n\n10.) After that, Go to Services > DNS Forwarder > Enable: Checked\n\n11.) Interfaces: All\n\n12.) Click Save\n\n13.) Navigate to Firewall > NAT, Port Forward tab\n\n14.) Click Add to create a new rule\n\n15.) Fill in the following fields on the port forward rule:\n\n        Interface: LAN\n\n        Protocol: TCP/UDP\n\n        Destination: Invert Match checked, LAN Address\n\n        Destination Port Range: 53 (DNS)\n\n        Redirect Target IP: 127.0.0.1\n\n        Redirect Target Port: 53 (DNS)\n\n        Description: Redirect DNS\n\n        NAT Reflection: Disable\n\n\n\nHopefully the above helps answer the questions!

I have done my research and figured out how to construct SDDL strings and construct a group policy that explicitly prohibits local administrators from clearing logs. This is working correctly for the application log and the system log, but the security log still clears. I have applied the exact same SDDL string to all three entries in the group policy. I cannot figure out why the security policy still clears! I believe it may have something to do with the policy conflicting with a local policy, but I cannot find evidence of this.

I checked out Exclaimer and CodeTwo, but both cannot be handled directly from Outlook...\n\nLong story: Due to lack of product availability at the time, we developed a neat little solution that uses an Outlook plugin and a web service on the backend to allow each users to set one of two (sickness and normal leave) out of office replies for themselves and the people in their team (the data is gathered in real time from Active Directory). Due to changes in organization and its stability (no one ever had to fix a bug in it), knowledge on how this tool works has been lost over the years as well as any documentation. So instead of reverse engineering the thing I would like to see if there are any alternatives available that can just be procured.\n\nYes, I know its doable via Powershell, but that would again introduce an in-house solution which I want to avoid.",

We are also required to work a full 8-hour work day with the 1 hour mandatory lunch break (9-5 does not exist anymore). There are no additional benefits or options for us if we have to work through the night or all weekend, etc.\n\nCurrently we do not have an on-call rotation; we are just called upon when an issue arises or a question needs to be answered.\n\nWe do monthly maintenance every 3rd week on early Sunday mornings and take care of any issues that come up day or night.\n\nI'm trying to see if this is the way it works all places or if there are rotations setup/limitations on hours worked, etc.\n\nIt's my first position with any sort of after hours requirement and being a salaried employee. When I asked about options for when we have to work all day in the office and 4-6 hours at night (like working from home the next day or a half-day) the response I got was \"You like having a job don't you?\"\n\nSo, how do you all do on-call? \n\nAnd are there stipulations or benefits that surround after-hours work?",

It was supposed to take 2 months of work, but we are almost approaching a year now. Dell and VMware fought over who would mainly do the project. Dell won the project. \n\nFIRST: They sent us a server solution before a site analyst was done. First fuck up.\n\nSecond: They do a site analysis to see what our requirements were for 200 machines. It takes 3 months. Should have taken 1 month. Doesn't matter anyway because we already have the hardware. Big waste of time.\n\nThird: They send out Dell contractors that sorta know VMware instead of VMware techs that know their own product. Takes much much longer to get things done.\n\nFourth: The thin clients don't support the software that we require, and need to be reimaged.... twice on all 200 machines.... then it still doesn't work and needs a final patch to get it to work and then dell says they wont support the OS we put on it even though its their software. So they said that they will support it if had a thin client issue we could just reformat it back and then ship it to them.\n\nfifth: We remake the Windows 10 image I shit you not around a dozen times because when the Dell contractor finally reaches a troubleshooting point he cant figureout he just says to nuke it and start over. GHHHHSH\n\nsixth: The server host can not be renamed !?!?!?!??! so the server manufacture needs to update the microcode to support a rename. that takes months to even get it on the domain.\n\nThere are a lot more stupid fucking issues, but it seems that so far with this project nothing has gone right. I have a negative view on Dell and CDW because of the lack of planning and coordination. I swear a drunk homeless man could have planned this better. \n\nFinally, the contract date is almost up and we have created several extensions too and it seems that they forgot about us.

The config has never worked since the build of the building (5 years), so I'm starting to tackle this. Our current set up is the following - \n\nCM288 Rooftop Antenna -> 125' LMR600 coax -> CMLP Lightning Supression -> CM2020-688 Amplifier -> 25' LMR600 coax -> A CellPhone-Mate ... Box? Not sure model #, side shows \"CM110718-A2075\" -> CM-S-4 4-Way Splitter -> 100' coax (x4) -> CM222 Indoor Antenna (x4)\n\nI can upload a screenshot of our as-built drawing of this if that doesn't make sense. I ran power to the amp, confirmed a red power light, and no DIP warnings, however no cell signal is found when I look using a few different phones. Is there a device I could use to test LMR600 coax? My current Fluke only does regular coax. Or, would you guys suggest I upgrade any of this equipment? Ideally, I would like to be able to give cell signal for any carrier to our admin staff.

            "selftext": "Take  it for what it's worth, but this was my experience with Nextiva over the past two weeks. \n\nTo start, my CEO's phone started deregistering throughout the day. He's an intelligent man with a respect for my time so he took it upon himself to call Nextiva to get it taken care of. He spent two hours on the phone with them to have them tell him, oh. It's because you've set your phone to do not disturb, but not regular do not disturb. A special one that requires you to type in several star codes. (Spoiler: He didn't do anything like that.) So he requests for escalation, and I'm brought in at this point because the next technician started saying the network wasn't set up properly. \n\nSo I start asking the usual questions of what do you think isn't configured correctly? He never provides a distinct answer, or one shred of evidence that would lead me to believe it's my network's issue. So he asks for a remote session to view the firewall's config. My first thought is not a chance, but I also need working phones. So I let him see what's going on. He immediately starts making changes to my production firewall without asking. Woot. So after letting him have his way, I hung up and went about my day. Not 15 minutes later more phones start deregistering. Whatever, it's 5 o'clock. We all went home and figured we'd deal with it the next day.\n\nNext day rolls around and the phones are still off and on. So I pony up and get on the phone with the \"Escalation\" team who I was led to believe was Tier 2 support. So we play our little blame game on each other for three hours and find no evidence that it's my issue or their issue. So I'm escalated to the manager of this department and am told there is no more escalation from here. \n\nShe starts off by telling me that it absolutely must be a part on my network because her server is throwing authentication errors because the phones have the wrong ips. Her words, not mine. She then proceeds to tell me for 45 minutes that the issue must lie in DHCP. When I explained our firewall was not running DHCP, she freaked. \"Well then how in the world are you getting IP addresses?\" I explained a server 2016 box was doing the lifting for that VLAN. My assumption is that she heard that buzz word and went with it. \"Oh it must be that the VLAN is configured improperly.\" So naturally I asked how that could be and she had no answer. The final straw was my favorite moment. With my CEO in my office, and her on speaker phone she actually asked the question \"Well which side of the firewall is your server on? The inside or outside.\" Click.  \n\nNew provider is in as of yesterday morning, same hardware, same technology, no issues. Happy Friday Ya'll.\n\ntl;dr Nextiva support was not helpful at all, and really just cost me about 16 hours of grief. Oh, and the \"Support Lead\" asked me which side of the firewall my server sat on.  \n",

Someone before me put in a Polycom RealPresence video conferencing system in all our locations across the world, some countries have 5-13 endpoints each. There has been nothing but problems with this, quality wise, since they have it running over their WAN. WAN speeds run anywhere from 4Mb to 30Mb per location. Every conference room has to interface to one bridge in the US (30Mb WAN in US). \n\nPolycom was brought in to do an assessment, and we implemented QoS across the network, and now own licenses for Appneta. Problems are still occurring. \n\nWe use Aryaka as a WAN provider, and have bypassed any optimizations and verified QoS is being passed through. Polycom is stating that it should work over the limited WAN speed, even in HD (we limited to 720). \n\nIf I see a 1% packet loss over the WAN, I get complaints.

            "selftext": "TL;DR: I'm planning to take away our users private SSH keys because they're not handling them in a responsible manner.\nIn the text I provide motivation for this, show my plan to implement it and discuss why this is a good thing.\nPlease let me know your opinions.\n\n# I've had a dream\n\nA nightmare actually.\nI dreamed of an admin at a small linux software company.\nPart of that companies business was to manage the installations of their software in their customers environments.\nFor this they were connected via a VPN with customer networks and used ssh to directly log in to the hosts they manage.\nFor some reason, the ssh access to customer host has been handled with a dowhaterveryouwantidontcare attitude.\nFrom both sides, themselves and their customers.\nThis resulted in very colorful `authorized_keys` files:\n\n- They contained a multitude of keys and no one knew who they belonged to.\n- Many keys belonged to users that had long since left the company.\n- Bits? I need more than 1024?\n- Some keys were more than a decade old.\n- I could go on but I don't want to.\n\nSome customer production environments were only reachable via a customer hop-host.\nSo it got worse:\n\n- Many users thought it would be good idea to copy their private key to the hop host, so they could then ssh to the target host.\n- This also made it easier to access their workstations from the customers environment.\n\nThe situation with the internal servers was just as horrible.\n\nThe admins attempts to enlighten his users to the error of their ways were met with little success. \nApparently using ssh-agent was such a terrible inconvenience!\n\nThis was when I woke up, sweat soaked.\nUnable to go back to sleep, I thought of a plan, should I ever encounter such a situation in the wild.\n\n# Taking away control from the user\n\nTo address all these problems, I intend to implement three things:\n\n\n1. I'll replace the normal public keys with signed certificates.\n1. I'll prevent users from editing the `authorized_keys` file.\n1. Third, as mentioned in the title, I'm planning to remove the private keys of our users from their grasp.\n\nI think steps 1 and 2 are not really controversial and require no further justification.\nMy motivation for this is clear, but is it the right thing?\n\nI think the most important argument against this is: 'My SSH key identifies me as *me*. If it's accessible to others, this identity is no longer a given!'.\nThat's true.\nThat's why the user gets to keep his private key all to himself.\nIt's just that he won't be able to access the customers systems with this key.\nBecause he's not accessing the customer production host as *himself*, but as an employee of his company in a specific role.\nThe SSH-key and the corresponding public key entry in `/etc/ssh/authorized_key/<user>` are a promise from the company to the customer:\n'This key belongs to an employee who should be able to access the system.'\nEnsuring that this promise is kept is my responsibility, so I get to keep the key.\n\nPutting such almost philosophical matters aside, the second argument I can think of is the question: Does that enhance security?\nAssuming responsible users: It doesn't.\nBut assuming responisble users is a bit like assuming a spherical cow.\nAs ~~I've witnessed~~ in my dream, some users value their convenience over the companies and customers security.\nAlso there're the users who don't think all day about security (which is totally OK).\nThese tend to forget details (i.e. keeping your key protected) or simply do things because they don't know any better.\nSo with these users in mind, the security gained is:\n\n- Keys will be protected by proper passwords.\n- Keys will be generated with 'good' parameters (i.e. 4096bit, ...)\n- Keys will be kept in exactly one location, which will be properly secured.\n\nSo what do you think?\nDoes this justify such an incisive step?\n\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n# How to pull it off\n\nThis is a rough scetch of how I intend to implement this.\nIf you see problems fell free to point them out.\nMaybe you've done something like this?\nPlease let me know.\n\n## Get rid of `authorized_keys` files\n\nTo prevent users from entering whatever they feel like into `authorized_keys`, I'll take the file away from them.\nThis is done by adding\n\n    AuthorizedKeysFile /etc/ssh/authorized_keys/%u\n\nto `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`.\n\nNext, for every user allowed on the host, I'll create a file `/etc/ssh/authorized_keys/<user>`and then properly protect it (chown, chmod, ...).\nJust in case I mess this up, I'll allow the admin user to continue using his `authorized_keys` files.\nAppend at the end of `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`:\n\n    Match User admin\n        AuthorizedKeysFile /etc/ssh/authorized_keys/%u .ssh/authorized_keys\n\n## Replace simpe public keys with certificates\n\nIn this context, certificates have three nice features:\n\n- They can have a limited lifetime.\n- They can be revoked by a CRL.\n- They get signed by a central authority.\n\nThe limited lifetime ensures, that  even if I should forget to remove them from the `authorized_keys` file, this will only be an issue until the end of the certificates validity.\nOf course, simply relying on the certificate expiry would be a bad idea: Think of a disgruntled ex-employ who wants to get revenge.\nOnce a user leaves the company his access to all internal and customer hosts must be revoked immediately.\nThis is where the CRL comes in.\nCentrally maintaining a CRL and distributing it within an appropriate timeframe is easily done.\nFinally, since I'll need to sign each and every certificate, I'll be the one deciding if/when a user gets access to a host.\n\nI haven't yet put together my own instructions on how to do this, but [this RedHat document](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html/Deployment_Guide/sec-Support_for_OpenSSH_Certificates.html) and [this text](https://ef.gy/hardening-ssh) will be my starting points.\n\n## Only allow SSH keys generated by myself and keep them from the users.\n\nHere's my plan:\n\n- Generate for each and every user a private key with proper password.\n- Put all private key files on a separate server in a directory only accessible by a special user `sshadmin`.\n- Every user gets a local user account on this host, to which he can log in via SSH.\n  Authentication will be done via his personal private key and a personal authentication token (I'm thinking of a YubiKey).\n- After logging in, the user can add his private key to his ssh-agent, accessing the key via sudo.\n  This will be done with a script wrapping `sudo -u sshadmin ssh-add <path to key>`.\n  The wrapper will temporarily open ssh agents socket for the user sshadmin, so the key can be added.\n\n# Final thoughts\n\n- Of course all this needs to be thoroughly scripted.\n- Creating the ceritifcats should happen automatically every 6 month, maybe more often.\n- Distribution to internal hosts should be done immediately and directly (i.e. with ansible). \n- Customers will be mailed an xml file with the new certificates, so they can be put into the authorized keys files.\n- The CRL should be regenerated daily and distributed via a web server.\n- The actual hard part of all this will be to convince the customers to play along.\n\nSo, what do you think?",

The IT department is currently doing wiki style documentation in Novell Vibe (could be better). The rest of the organization had a bad experience with Vibe and therefore, will not use it. Their current method for documentation is using word and saving the files as HTML, creating links in one table of contents page.\n\nI know there a ton of different tools for documentation and a good number of other posts to reference for that topic.

The API Server is in the cloud.\n\n\n\nI've tried everything (more on this later) but to no avail. The response time stays that high for 4 months.\n\n\n\nThis morning, sh*t hits the fan. Suddenly no one including branch office can't use the application, the app crash everytime someone tried using it.\n\n\nI tried opening the API Server's web page (which should return empty bracket)......  The browser gives me error saying \"cipher not supported\" ....... WTF\n\n\nSo I ping the API Server ...... It checks out. using (xx.xxxx.com)\n\nThen I do Traceroute the API Server ....... It checks out. using (xx.xxxx.com)\n\nThen I Tried Accessing the server through SSH ......... It went fine. using (xx.xxxx.com)\n\nThen I check all Logs including the API Log ......... No error, no Fault. using (xx.xxxx.com)\n\nI quickly opens Visual Studio and check the code for any possible bug\n\nI connect through VPN server and tried using the Application ......... it runs.\n\nWait WTF? I called the ISP, tells them my problem. they say they might have routing issue to the cloud provider. But I can connect to The Main Application server and VPN Server. 20 mins of debating with the poor ISP Tech Support to no avail.... So at this point I'm getting pretty pissed and have been screaming and swearing at the lovely rubber duck for the last few minutes.\n\nBecause it's the busiest time of the day. My phone are ringing from branch manager asking for solution.\n\nThen I remember the magic word of /r/sysadmin. \"It's always the DNS\".\n\nI Disconnect my VPN, and change the DNS Setting on my laptop....\n\nBoom it works.... Tried it on another Staff's PC....... Boom it Works\n\nI feel like an idiot.\n\nAnd it even fix the very long response time problem I've been having for the last few months.\n\ntl:dr Should've check DNS first, didn't, scream a lot of profanity at the poor yellow rubber floaters, change DNS Setting, It's the f*cking dns.\n\n*edit : wrong error",

Over the years they've supplied us with products that **require** their intervention for support. I.e. I can't go to the vendor directly, I have to go through our third party because the vendor doesn't offer \"direct support\". Or if they do, it's at a much higher price.\n\nThey regularly underperform but my boss doesn't mind their SLA's not lining up with our own. To be fair, he doesn't mind if I don't reach our SLA's either (we're a pretty tight, small team), but it means that any job that goes to them instantly has a massive additional workload of checking up on these guys to a) see if they've done the work yet and b) test it immediately after because they frequently lie about what they've done.\n\nI genuinely don't believe my boss is receiving any kickbacks, just supporting a friend, but my concern is that there's not really any room for me to grow here. \nIf I can't improve the environment here, I don't really have anything I can \"add to my resume\" other than \"survived X years at this location\". There's not really any room to grow from a \"management\" perspective other than accruing responsibility, and the technology side of things I'm not getting to because we're so flooded with standard work. \n\nOther than moving on, or sucking it up, I'm not seeing a lot of option here.",

They're supposed to be training and mentoring us on things, but it never works out well. They aren't responsible for watching out for tickets like us tier 1's are, so rather than them coming to us with something that they can teach us, we have to go to them and get half-assed instructions and condescending demeanor.

I spend a lot of time installing Debian on new VMs, and managing all of the individual servers is going to be a pain in the neck. How can I deal? I should be able to create a standard Debian image that I can copy to spawn new installations, but managing all of the VMs will still be a chore.\n\nI've read a little bit about configuration management suites, and it sounds like I'm wanting something like that. I've read about systems that SSH into machines on the local network, and provide the user with a web based interface to manage them. All of the advice Google provides tells me to avoid Webmin, and it looks like Ansible is a plugin option for Foreman while also being an independent project. Do these tools try to run a variety of servers on one machine, or can I point them at a machine to manage?\n\nEDIT: What about ISPConfig?",

I am looking to use this utility to set a BIOS password (I believe it's called a \"setup password\") on all my systems, and also configure Wake on LAN.  \n\nI created my settings package and deployed it, and I can tell it's applying because ~the Wake on LAN~ some parts of it is applying as it should, but others are not (see log below).  However, the BIOS password is not being set.  I am pretty positive I am just missing something in the Dell Command settings.  The settings I have configured are as follows:\n\nadmsetuplockout (enable)\noromuiprotection (enable)\nsetuppwd (enable)\n\nIs there anything else I'm missing to get a BIOS password to apply?  I've tried deploying the package it creates manually, and also via BigFix, so I don't think it's a deployment issue as much as it's a packaging issue and me not knowing what I'm doing.\n\nThanks !\n\nEdit* I just found the log it generated after running.

Sometimes there's a random device from left field with a 3rd party app.  Sometimes a vulnerability takes a lot of effort to research and determine the appropriate fix.  Who out there really has a true vulnerability free enterprise?",

These two incidents are the worst of many other problems like incorrect replacement parts being sent, engineer not arriving on site etc etc. \n\nIts like after the Dell EMC merger that things have slipped into utter chaos with their support. \n\nIs it just me experiencing this?\n\nAm I really considering climbing off the Dell train and hopping on to Cisco UCS??\n\nWhat is life???\n\n ",

Printers are deployed via GPO to a subset of our users based on OU container.\n\nWe've had reports from 5 or 6 users (out of roughly 100 total users) of really slow print times.  Typically it will take 1 minute and a few seconds for the print dialog to appear, and about the same time for the job to be sent to the print server after hitting \"Print\" within the print dialog.

I then manually added the printers to the machines using the print server's IP in the UNC rather than hostname, and printing works as expected.\n\nObviously the issue lies in DNS somewhere.  All workstations (working and not working) are pulling DHCP from the same server.  Checked DNS settings, and everything looks correct.  Tried resetting the IP stack as well as the winsock stack, nothing.\n\nAnyone else run into this issue before?

The company is fairly large (not quite 10,000 employees) and geographically distributed throughout the world.\n\nMy employer acquired many disparate Slack teams over the course of many acquisitions. Over time, employees joined multiple teams as they moved between initiatives, projects, or product groups. So the executive team decided it was time to force everyone onto one team. The work is done and there are several default channels you are added to but are muted by default. Most of them have the various types of broadcast @s disabled.

Since our deployment is now finished I decided to go back and validate whether or not all of the mailNickName attributes were actually filled in. I created a PowerShell script to dump this info out to a CSV and found that about 10% of our user email accounts do not have anything specified for a mailNickName. I have asked several of those users if their email has been functioning properly and they reported no issues.\n\nShould I go back and fill in those attributes or should I leave it as-is since nothing is broken?

I estimate the cost of board replacement now is way more than the laptop prices. this is all done under warranty. \n\nContacted HP support center, and explained that this can't keep on happening, I need a solution by replacing or refund, I just got off the phone with their representative, they basically gave me the middle finger and said I should buy the \"HP Premium Accidental Damage Protection\" to extend the warranty for another year or so. They also claimed that we're doing something wrong on the software side that keeps on frying the boards O_o? like...wtf?\n\nUpon refusing this lame ass solution, they said that replacing/refunding at this point is no longer an option. And here I am stuck with laptops that keeps on randomly failing.\n\nI will never again touch a piece of hardware with the HP logo on it, fook this shit!\n\n**Edit:** Holy shit this exploded! here are some answers:  \n\n- Laptops are bought from a local vendor, vendor said they can only keep replacing the motherboard, they're the one who recommend that I actually contact HP directly.\n- My local VAR is shit, they won't left a finger if it doesn't benefit them one way or another.\n- Will try the suggested \"hold the power button 90 seconds or so\" trick at the next unexpected random laptop failure cycle. I do remember doing something like that before but it didn't do anything. \n- Lots of references to Lemon laws, I will have to check if we have something similar here. \n- ProLiant is the only thing I can honestly say good about HP, rest is shit! \n- Lenovo is king specially those T series laptops, like one of the comments below \"tank\" of a laptop.\n",

            "selftext": "Hi, I'm designing a backup and restore disaster recovery regimes, with testing restores, for several different types of systems.  All Unix-like.\n\nI'm not interested in clever solutions or immature practices and tools.  I don't care about some clever trick a teenager came up with in his homelab when they never had set foot in a real enterprise or DC.  I want a thorough guide to the foundational principles and practices of disaster recovery, along with information about how portable, venerable, and well tested free software can implement these (e.g., rsync, dump, cpio, Amanda, tar, etc).\n\nUnbiased information about file systems would be nice, but honestly, I'd rather have no recommendation for fs than a heavily biased push towards ZFS, for example.  In fact, I've already kinda decided on ZFS for the NAS and perhaps first-order backups as well.  Second order backup will use something life ext4 mirrored and be stored offsite somehow.\n\nOnce I've got confidence in basic full backups and restores, then I will crank it up to incremental or differential backups, but that's about as far as I want to take it in complexity.  I'm assuming some of the sysadmins reading this will get where I'm coming from.\n\nSo, in the same way that the famous \"The Unix Time Sharing System\" (1969) from BSTJ was the definitive statement of Unix fundamentals, what do we have for the critically important topic of disaster recovery?\n\nI'm doing this with URGENCY because I am responsible for administering a system used 24/7 by 10000 developers and due to some stupid management decision haven't listened to me.  The system is simultaneously drowning and on fire, and we need vertically scaled upgrades but our Tech Infra. Group wants everything horizontally Scalable, which is just not possible. We are undersresourced anyway.\n\nInstead of getting wrapped up in that argument, I'm going off to the side to work on a proper backup/restore solution (HA is not sufficient for real backups; rather, it is a convenience to keep things while you figure out what went wrong).\n\nMy point of view is one of protection and confidence you can restore after true disaster, e.g. Weekend-long .  If I have that basic, fundamental, critical system backed up, then I believe this will also improve feature velocity because knowing the backups makes us less risk-averse.\n\nIf anybody can advice, I would be greatly appreciative.

            "selftext": "Hey guys, could use a second opinion on this, as it feels like I'm overbuilding just a bit!\n\nClient is a sort of social network... for social network influencers. Think of bloggers, vloggers etc,: where do they go to discuss strategies etc? Enter my client.\n\nClient has experienced explosive growth. Started 18 months ago with 30 founding members, some gum, spit, a Wordpress site and a dream, it's now grown explosively to about 1,500 members, with each paying a monthly subscription fee. Growth is currently about 200 members a month.\n\nThis site also does a ton of merchandising outside of the subscription fees. The amount of engagement on this platform is phenomenal.\n\nAll in all, this client is expected to break the 20,000 transaction threshold within a few months, meaning they go up a PCI bracket.\n\nNow, here's the problem. Some pivotal decisions made by my predecessor has melded the following together:\n\n* WordPress\n* (a WordPress membership plugin that is popular and shall remain nameless)\n* authorize.net, with ARB\n\nThe keen-eyed fellas in this sub might recognize that this means A-EP. Right away, this is a big problem, because me and my software developer did a code audit of this membership plugin as requested by the client, and discovered some glaring flaws in the way it's structured. Suffice it to say, there might be a lawsuit in the short future. Let's forget about that part, though.\n\nSo, cutting this plugin out of the equation, we end up with this:\n\n* WordPress\n* 1,500 ARB subscriptions on authorize.net\n* 1,500 customers loaded into CIM on authorize.net\n* Switching from authorize.net is out of the question, as it would require 1,500 users to reconsent to a new billing profile.\n* 6 staff members\n* No premises or brick and mortar (all staff work remotely)\n\nObviously, it's way too much to hire some overseas virtual assistants to do the billing work for us, so I was thinking of something like this. Let's put together a separated billing system, and have it interact with the wordpress \"product\" site with some sort of dumbfire access control plugin.\n\nSo I was in the design phase of this solution, and as both me and my software guy had experience with it already, we selected WHMCS. Easy choice; it would be relatively easy to migrate the preexisting authorize.net billing profiles into WHMCS using a homegrown script, and just flop over the API URL in authorize.net when it's ready to go. And, it also aligns with this clients future plans, which involve hosting anyway.\n\nThe problem now lies with the looming 20k threshold. We've decided to be proactive and meet the requirements early. The issue lies with some of these requirements. What I'm putting together *makes sense* from a compliance perspective, but in my years of experience, I've just never had to build something so hilariously overpowered for just a half a dozen users. Here's my proposed rollout:\n\n* WHMCS as billing system\n* WordPress\n* Some access plugin for WordPress with a pokable API\n* Custom activation/suspension/termination scripts on WHMCS\n* Custom migrator script to migrate existing crap plugin billing profiles over to WHMCS\n* AWS as hosting platform for billing system\n\nStill following me? It gets worse:\n\n* To meet firewall and antivirus requirements (specifically, the requirement that neither can be disabled by the users), we're putting together a VNC virtual terminal running Ubuntu\n* Only users logged onto this virtual terminal can access the admin portion of WHMCS\n* To meet 256-bit encryption requirements, we've selected RealVNC as our terminal vendor\n* To meet segmentation requirements, we have the VNC server running on a different VPC than WHMCS, with strict flow control between the VPCs\n* To meet MFA requirements with RealVNC, we have a Domain Controller\n* To also meet said MFA requirements, we also have active directory certificate services\n* Users will require either a Yubikey or some other auth method (haven't decided yet)\n* Terminal and WHMCS will have an antivirus (most likely Kaspersky)\n* Terminals and WHMCS will have some kind of file change detection solution\n* Terminals will not have routable Internet access outside of what is required to use VNC and get apt updates\n* Clipboard and file copying disabled on the terminals; its strictly KVM\n* Each terminal will run a stripped-down version of Xfce4\n* To meet WAF requirements, we are using ModSecurity\n* Microsoft-provisioned Office 365\n* Each instance is encrypted at the EBS level\n* One RDS instance for the billing system, encrypted using its own CMK\n\nWe're also sourcing out a QSA to look over a CCW for us; the firewall and antivirus requirements are impossible to enforce as we don's have physical control over accessing workstations. Yes, a QSA for a Level 3.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning this clients' partner does disaster recovery and business continuity planning for fortune 500s. So, you can assume that there is significant buy-in for compliance-related solutions. To give you an idea just how much buy-in, *we have triple-redundant backup,* and an *actual 60-page continuity plan* in the event I should get hit by a bus or something.\n\nSo, anyway, the budget. Here's what I have to work with that's approved thus far:\n\n2 x t2.medium EC2 instances Full-Upfront (already purchased)  \n1 x db.t2.medium RDS instance Full-Upfront (already purchased)  \n$40 a month for WHMCS  \n~$125 a month for billing-related AWS services  (does not include cost of ownership for above prepurchased instances)  \nVery reasonable development and implementation budget (lawsuit, remember?)  \n\nThe bottom line, is I've built systems less than *half* as complex for clients with 30-60 employess, much less this client with just 6! This just feels so *wrong* to build it out like this. Especially plopping down a domain controller. For **six** users!\n\nAny ideas??",

You have all these tiny little kingdoms making decisions without consulting anyone anywhere else about the potential impact.\n\nWell, when we went BYOD for smart phones we had a mountain of issues.  Right now the recommended solution is to go iOS and use AirWatch Native mode.  Other configurations are \"supported,\" but if you experience an issues they'll just tell you to go iPhone native.\n\nSo, over the last 2 years people have been migrating to iPhones in our little corner of the corporate world as they pay off their existing phones.\n\nAND THEN, someone decides to roll out a policy disabling all external removable media.  When the iPhone is plugged in, policy disables the iPhone driver, and it immediately STOPS CHARGING.\n\nThis, of course, is kind of an issue for our mobile workforce that routinely plug in their iPhone into their laptop to charge it while they're out somewhere with a customer, or someplace doing paperwork that isn't home.\n\nNot 100% sure what the solution they picked to do this is, but I've gotten a whole mess of nasty complaints from people I support about this issue.  I, of course, had to escalate up my food chain, and we were basically told that we just have to \"deal with it.\"  When I tried to press them to reveal to me if they know about the iPhone charging issue, they didn't say a word...\n\nThough it was amusing when someone had to drive to Best Buy as soon as they opened to buy 20 iPad chargers, power strips, and lightning cables, so the board meeting taking place that day could happen (all board members use iPads during board meetings and not all of them always charge them the night before.  Though an iPad charges slowly on a laptop USB port, it at least charges enough to stay on for an all day board meeting.)\n\nI have already been told that they are NOT rolling this back.\n\nSigh...\n\n",

            "selftext": "Back in college I got a job as an intern for this sort of weird department at the university with a name something like Auxiliary Services. The department was responsible for a bunch of very random stuff that didn't fall anywhere else: lab stock rooms and ordering lab chemicals, the campus shuttle buses that looped around campus, bicycle racks, the mini convenience stores in campus buildings, the campus ID cards, and they owned the campus cable TV contract. The university had a huge IT department, but this department I worked for had its own \"IT Manager\" who was basically responsible for all the desktops and laptops, a few servers for department applications, and some other minor stuff.\n\nIt was really like a small business. One lone IT guy with a crew of about 5 interns. It was like 2002 so we didn't have a ton of management tools. \n\n\"Auxiliary Services\" was led by a typical small business executive who didn't understand technology and wanted to look good (I'll call him $CEO), and the IT manager (I'll call him $ITManager) was typical guy who got the job because he could kind of figure out computers but had no business or technical education. As to be expected, he was doing the best he could with minimal budget that $CEO would try to squeeze. \n\nAs usual, $CEO and $ITManager had a terrible relationship. $ITManager thought $CEO was an idiot and too cheap, and $CEO thought $ITManager was inept and irresponsible. The truth was both of the were probably right about each other, but both were also a bit wrong about each other. As usual, the people in these relationships typically deserve each other.\n\nA major point of contention between them was the fact that every single PC had a webcam that $CEO had demanded $ITManager buy for video conferencing, but they didn't work. Since as you can imagine this department had people scattered all over the entire university campus in various offices, $CEO thought that video conferencing would reduce the number of meetings and time spent walking/driving across campus with staff. \n\n$CEO told $ITManager to go buy the cheapest webcams that $CEO could find, and install them everywhere. $ITManager dutifully ordered them as he was told and then went around installing them on every computer one by one. It took forever. Even though the cameras were probably like 99 bucks in 2002, they were crap. Nobody ever used them since they didn't know how, and when they had tried to use them they didn't work, so they just kept picking up the phone or walking to meetings.\n\n$CEO saw the whole thing as a massive failure, and blamed $ITManager.\n\nIt's important to look at this from both sides. $ITManager felt that he had just done as he was told, and yet again was being yelled at for something that wasn't his fault. $CEO felt that he hired $ITManager to be a technical expert who yet again didn't make something work.\n\nSo what should have happened? $ITManager obviously can't change $CEO's behavior, and $ITManager can't force $CEO to do anything or think a different way. That's a common thing someone like $ITmanager wants to do, but you can't do that.\n\n$ITManger probably should have suggested doing a pilot project first with about 5 of these webcams. This would have been an easy way for $CEO to see that they were garbage without $ITManager saying \"I told you so.\" He'd actually be able to spend some time with those 5 users, and have them try to use this stuff. If it didn't work a few different models could have been purchased. $CEO wanted the cheapest one because he figured they're all the same.\n\n$ITManager could also have brought in multiple vendors. Good video conferencing is expensive. If you bring in 3 vendors and their pricing is $500, $600, and $1000 for a particular unit, it can help show the budget item is really not an option after all.\n\nIt's a tough situation to be in, and for some reason this cycle just keeps repeating.",

There are so many options I am feeling a bit overwhelmed. Off the hop, it seems like PRTG is most trusted among IT professionals, but I'm having a hard time understanding how many sensors I may need. I haven't been given a price from the execs, but I know they prefer open-source and free no matter the advantages of the paid options. Solarwinds and other expensive packages are not an option. Initially, I was looking at Zabbix and PRTG. However, Zabbix does not look as feature rich and from other user accounts, is a pain in the ass to role out.\n\nWe have 3 sites, each with Sophos XG firewalls, 1 24 port Cisco switch, 2 ESXi hosts in HA and EqualLogic disk arrays. We have about 10 Windows 2012 server VMs (3 domain controllers, 2 rapid recovery cores, 1 exchange server, 3 vCenter servers). We also have a bunch of Linux VMs used for production and development and some AWS Linux servers as well.\n\nIs there anyone out there with a smallish setup like ours? What are you using for monitoring and alerting? Why? Will 100 PRTG sensors be enough for this environment?\n\n",

Duke ordered the scrub on the grounds that the company has connections to the Russian government and its software poses a security risk.\n\n>\u201cThe Department is concerned about the ties between certain Kaspersky officials and Russian intelligence and other government agencies, and requirements under Russian law that allow Russian intelligence agencies to request or compel assistance from Kaspersky and to intercept communications transiting Russian networks,\u201d the department said in a statement. \u201cThe risk that the Russian government, whether acting on its own or in collaboration with Kaspersky, could capitalize on access provided by Kaspersky products to compromise federal information and information systems directly implicates U.S. national security.\u201d\n\n>The directive comes months after the federal General Services Administration, the agency in charge of government purchasing, removed Kaspersky from its list of approved vendors. In doing so, the GSA suggested a vulnerability exists in Kaspersky that could give the Kremlin backdoor access to the systems the company protects.\n\n>In a statement to The Washington Post on Wednesday, the company said: \u201cKaspersky Lab doesn\u2019t have inappropriate ties with any government, which is why no credible evidence has been presented publicly by anyone or any organization to back up the false allegations made against the company. The only conclusion seems to be that Kaspersky Lab, a private company, is caught in the middle of a geopolitical fight, and it\u2019s being treated unfairly even though the company has never helped, nor will help, any government in the world with its cyberespionage or offensive cyber efforts.\u201d\n\n>\u201cKaspersky Lab has always acknowledged that it provides appropriate products and services to governments around the world to protect those organizations from cyberthreats, but it does not have unethical ties or affiliations with any government, including Russia,\u201d the firm said.\n\n>The directive comes in the wake of an unprecedented Russian operation to interfere in the U.S. presidential election that saw Russian spy services hack the networks of the Democratic National Committee and other political organizations and release damaging information.\n\n>At least a half-dozen federal agencies run Kaspersky on their networks, the U.S. officials said, although there may be other networks where an agency\u2019s chief information security officer \u2014 the official ultimately responsible for systems security \u2014 might not be aware it is being used.\n\n>The order applies only to civilian government networks, not the military\u2019s. But the Defense Department, which includes the National Security Agency, does not generally use Kaspersky software, officials said.\n\n>The U.S. intelligence community has long assessed that Kaspersky has ties to the Russian government, according to officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. The company\u2019s founder, Eugene Kaspersky, graduated from a KGB-supported cryptography school and had worked in Russian military intelligence.\n\n>In recent months concern has mounted inside the government about the potential for Kaspersky software to be used to gather information for the Russian secret services, officials said.\n\n>Richard Ledgett, former NSA deputy director, hailed the move. Speaking Wednesday on the sidelines of the Billington CyberSecurity Summit in Washington, he noted that Kaspersky, like other Russian companies, is \u201cbound to comply with the directive of Russian state security services, by law, to share with them information from their servers.\u201d\n\n>Concerns about Kaspersky software had been brewing for years, according to one former official who told The Post that some congressional staffers were warned by federal law enforcement officials as early as November 2015 not to meet with employees from Kaspersky, over concerns about electronic surveillance.\n\n>When the GSA announced its July decision, it underscored that its mission was to \u201censure the integrity and security of U.S. government systems and networks\u201d and that Kaspersky was delisted \u201cafter review and careful consideration.\u201d The action removed the company from the list of products approved for purchase on federal systems and at discounted prices for state governments.\n\n>The directive will also put pressure on state and local governments that use Kaspersky\u2019s products. Many had been left to speculate about the risks of sticking with the company or abandoning taxpayer-funded contracts, sometimes at great cost. In July, The Post found several state or local agencies that used Kaspersky\u2019s anti-virus or security software had purchased or supported the software within the past two years.\n\n[Link](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-to-ban-use-of-kaspersky-software-in-federal-agencies-amid-concerns-of-russian-espionage/2017/09/13/36b717d0-989e-11e7-82e4-f1076f6d6152_story.html)",

Some manual normalization of SQL output, to make it tab separated\n- Excel spreadsheet with MID, LEN, LEFT functions that can split up the sed output into columns\n- Pivot table to generate list of unique IPs (that breaks every time file is moved to a different location. Thanks Microsoft)\n- Vlookups of those IPs, pulling data in from the various source to make a master table (that isn't capable of displaying two values per lookup, so if I build a separate step to list out all duplicate entries so I can deal with them)\n- Excel sorts and filters to carve up master table into groups of things\n\n- Goals\n\n1. Separate data from parsing, make a system where I can easily load in a new data set, or easily update to a new 'parsing set' with an older data set.\n- automate the filter and split part\n- Less likely to break\n- Simpler process, so I don't have to be involved to make the report\n- More elegant\n\n- Ideas\n\n1. Use awk to do additional processing on the linux CLI side? https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/88550/vlookup-function-in-unix\n- I have some co-workers who use Power-BI, not sure if that would be a good fit\n- Some other free / cheap alternative?\n\n\nThank you for your time and input!",

I double checked and thought it can't be possible.\n\nI disabled active sync. Web connectivity. Owa. Converted to a shared mailbox. Changed the password. disabled sign in and everything. They were still getting mail to the phone apparently. So I double checked any forwarding emails. Any phone synced with the account. Nothing. Also checked someone who had access to the mailbox in their outlook in case there were any rules. None.\n\nSo after more googling and conveying with a colleague. We searched for something and came across a script that checks for any rules in place maybe through all accounts in the company.  We found the account was still forwarding to an personal account of the leaver. So someone suggested it may of been created in owa.  So once I logged in as them after adding a licence temporarily, it turns out the rule was  indeed created in owa. We removed this and have heard nothing since.  My concerns are now though how many users could have this in other companies.

Unfortunately, Microsoft has made that very difficult to do. UEFI boot requires that your USB disk be formatted in FAT32. FAT32 does not support over 4gb files. The Install.WIM for Server 2016 is larger than 4gb.\n\nYou can use DISM to split the WIM into two pieces, however that is not supported by the Windows 10/Server 2016 installer. How does Microsoft think you're going to install this?!\n\nI've found some workarounds via google searches, but no official guidelines from Microsoft on how to do it.

            "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nEver since MS moved to Server 2012, I've struggled with configuring RDP.  It used to be a few seconds task, but now they require you to run through wizards etc it's something I need to learn every time I come to configure it.\n\nSo, the scenario is - I have 2 physical servers which I am going to use as RDP Session Hosts.  TS1 and TS2.  I run roaming profiles and my RDP licensing is elsewhere on a domain controller on a third server that has all my virtualised servers on it (file, print, etc).\n\nWhat do I need to do/install to make these two boxes load-balance RDP both inside and outside?\n\nI know I need to install NLB and setup round robin DNS internally, and I can set up my router (pfsense) to do loadbalanced inbound connections from the internet if necessary, BUT - what other components do I need to install?\n\ni.e. do I install an RD Gateway? and if so, how do I configure this to point to a loadbalanced cluster of RDP Session Hosts?\n\nAlso, what do I do with the RD Connection Broker?  Does this sit on a separate box and broker inbound connections to the loadbalanced TS server cluster?  Do I point the RD Gateway to it for outside connections?\n\nI'm sure it's easy to do, I'd just like to avoid achitectural cockups :)\n\nThanks,\nMike.",

However the vRO workflow that deploys servers is quite long, complicated and error prone, sometime because\nof incorrect inputs, sometimes just because it feels like it.\nWhen the deployment works its awesome since other than cloning our VM template, it creates the necessary AD groups, joins it\u2019s computer object into different group, sets-up our backup, creates a server CI in our CMDB and more.\n\nI've been debugging and adding new features but I can\u2019t shake the feeling that vRO simply isn't the product we should be using because it\u2019s very unreliable.\nTherefore I\u2019m looking for the advice of other more seasoned SA's, how do you deploy and configure servers?\n",

            "selftext": "This might not be the right place as I may need to post this in the Skype for Business subreddit or even networking. \n\nWe have 3 sites that have their own on-premise Lync 2013 servers.  These servers have ALL the bells and whistles.  Chat, persistent chat, Enterprise Voice to our Audiocodes mediant 1000, full audio/video meetings, federation to Office 365 Unified MEsseging for voicemail and auto attendants for phone system, etc, etc.  The Lync servers do not have a gateway.  They have persistent static routes in Windows to make sure the connectivity for our private subnets works, but no route from the internal interface to anything external.   This is apparently best practice according to Microsoft and we have never had a problem with it except for when we add a new subnet and need to remember to add that new subnet to the persistent routes.\n\nAt random times, days or weeks, People in site 1 cannot see the status of the people in site 3.  Site 2 can see both.   Since our Site 1 is our federated edge, this means when people try to join meetings for site 3 externally, they cannot dial into the meeting as the server in Site 1 tries to contact the server in site 3 and cannot.  It is a very similar behaviour as if our vpn tunnel went down.\n\nSo this is where it gets weird.  Site 3 server cannot ping Site 1 server.  Site 1 server CAN ping Site 3 server.  Everything on the same subnet, and on the same hypervisor in Site 3 can ping the Site 1 Lync server.  Everything EXCEPT for the site 3 Lync server.  Everything in site 1 can ping the Site 3 Lync server.  It is ONLY the ping from Site 3 Lync server to the Site 1 Lync server. \n\nOf course I see logs in the Site 3 Lync server indicating it cannot connect with the Site 1 server.  Same thing for the Site 1 server indicating it cannot connect to the site 1 server.\n\nThe immediate fix is a reboot of the Site 3 Lync server.  Once it comes back up, ping works fine and everything is happy again.\n\nWe had a Sonicwall NSA2400 at site 1 which was JUST replaced with a Sonicwall NSA2600.  The problem existed with either.  Site 3 has a Fortigate 100D.  When doing a packet capture on either the Sonicwall or the Fortigate, I see nothing when pinging from site 3 to site 1.  I only see the ping attempt to take a route via the external WAN and not the VPN tunnel.  Like it is trying to route a packet for 192.168.X.X through Windstream instead of the VPN tunnel interface.  There is no Windows firewall enabled in either sites on our Lync servers.  \n\nThe big problem is these issues only occur, conveniently, in the middle of the day.  So I can either troubleshoot the issue and keep people from being able to use their Lync solution completely, or reboot the server and make everyone happy.  This means I really don't have much time to troubleshoot and I cannot replicate the issue.  UGGG\n\nHas anyone seen this with a Lync or S4B implementation or possibly with other Microsoft Server solutions?",

            "selftext": "Hello all,\n\nWe've been experiencing the following issue with our MongoDB nodes, and have recently upgraded to a newer version of the Linux kernel, a newer version of MongoDB that is a binary replacement (working to deprecate MongoDB, but this is where we are), as well as an Ubuntu LTS version bump (14 -> 16).\n\nWe have experienced this issue on Ubuntu 14 and Ubuntu 16.  It seems that this stack trace from dmesg seems to indicate something related to disk issues.  Potentially thinking we should attempt to use XFS filesystem to see if it prevents this type of issue, but since I didn't see much around about this I wanted to ping everyone here to see if you had any experience with this and was able to overcome the issue.\n\nRegards in advance for any insight you can provide.\n\nInstance Information:\n==============\n    Instance Size: i2.2xlarge\n    MongoDB: 2.6.12\n    Kernel: Linux 4.4.0-1022-aws #31-Ubuntu SMP Tue Jun 27 11:27:55 UTC 2017 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n    Distribution: Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS\n    Max open files: 64000 (confirmed with limits file of /proc/pid/limits)\n\nKernel Log:\n=======\n    [2668480.236056] Code: cc cc cc b8 1c 00 00 00 0f 01 c1 c3 cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc b8 1d 00 00 00 0f 01 c1 <c3> cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc\n    [2668481.072542] serial8250: too much work for irq4\n    [2668483.060071] serial8250: too much work for irq4\n    [2668485.048072] serial8250: too much work for irq4\n    [2668487.138422] serial8250: too much work for irq4\n    [2668489.124070] serial8250: too much work for irq4\n    [2668491.116069] serial8250: too much work for irq4\n    [2668493.104065] serial8250: too much work for irq4\n    [2668493.104065] INFO: rcu_sched self-detected stall on CPU\n    [2668493.104065]    1-...: (1 GPs behind) idle=111/140000000000001/0 softirq=4805007/4805007 fqs=148991\n    [2668493.168063] INFO: rcu_sched detected stalls on CPUs/tasks:\n    [2668493.168067]    1-...: (1 GPs behind) idle=111/140000000000001/0 softirq=4805007/4805007 fqs=148991\n    [2668493.168070]    (detected by 7, t=150017 jiffies, g=6241551, c=6241550, q=78051)\n    [2668493.168071] Task dump for CPU 1:\n    [2668493.168073] rs:main Q:Reg   R  running task        0  1258      1 0x00000008\n    [2668493.168076]  ffff880f0acf3c90 ffffffff8123b139 0000000000000003 ffff880bc59e00e8\n    [2668493.168078]  0000000000000000 0000000000000006 ffff8800c28e6100 ffff880bc59e00e8\n    [2668493.168079]  ffff880f0acf3cc8 ffffffff81227739 ffff880f08bdb000 ffff8800c28e6100\n    [2668493.168079] Call Trace:\n    [2668493.168085]  [<ffffffff8123b139>] ?

AWS and Mr. 0x2a are both leaning towards the syslog daemon.  I'm continuing to investigate the configuration of rsyslogd on these instances.  The disk errors are almost certainly related to the fact that the CPU is pegged with interrupts that are causing failures committing data to disk.\n\nUpdate #2:\n\nWe believe the problem is exactly what is described above.  AWS was able to see from what we can tell MongoDB payloads being excessively logged to the console.  First part to resolve the issue was to reconfigure rsyslogd default logging levels.  The following rewrites fix error messages in the default Ubuntu 16 configurations, and updates the default logging level.\n\n    sudo sed -i '/$KLogPermitNonKernelFacility on/d' /etc/rsyslog.conf\n    sudo sed -i 's/module(load=\\\"imklog\\\")/module(load=\\\"imklog\\\" permitnonkernelfacility=\\\"on\\\" consoleloglevel=\\\"4\\\")/g' /etc/rsyslog.conf\n    sudo sed -i '65,68d' /etc/rsyslog.d/50-default.conf\n    sudo systemctl restart rsyslog.service\n\nThe second portion to the fix is what we're currently doing is ensuring the MongoDB instances are running mongod as the mongo user.  Only root can access /dev/console and /dev/ttyS0.  We believe with these updates this issue will be avoided.  I do understand it should not have been running as root in the first place (!)",

            "selftext": "We have a DFS replication and namespace for 3 sites.  These sites are locked to their local file server and will not point anyone in a site outside of their local file server.  This is because sometimes the DFS namespace would point users to another site, cause too many DFS conflicts.  Each site works in their own folder so there would rarely be a situation where a file is conflicting.  When 3 out of 10 people in a department at one site would be pointed to another sites' file server, we would see a huge increase in conflicts since those 10 people are constantly in the same files.\n\nI also have file access auditing enabled on the server.  If a person saves, deletes, modifies, or creates a file, it is recorded in Event Viewer as a 4663.  This typically works without fail.\n\nI also have a notification email that is sent out whenever a DFS Conflict happens and a file is moved to conflict and deleted (Event ID 4412).  When a conflict arises, I almost always get an email from two different servers.\n\nWith all of that said, probably 4 out of 5 times I search all 3 servers in the Security log for the specific file that conflicted, and either find that no one touched that file, or in many other cases only 1 person modified the file.  Sometimes I see that \"SYSTEM\" touched the file at that time but I cannot determine why.\n\n1 out of 5 times I see two different people on the server modifying the file at about the same time which is what I would expect almost 100% of the time.  \n\nUsually when I see 1 or 2 users in a file around the same time, I will send them the main file, and the file from the conflict and deleted folder.  If it is 2 users I will typically see a difference in the file and in most cases the winning file was the one that is correct.  \n\nI'm just trying to get to the bottom of this.  I would like to assume my diligence in getting this info to the users has saved us from any lost work, but I cannot be so sure if I don't see a 4663 indicating a file is even being touched.",

The reason for this is because I have an SBS 2011 server that is using port 443 for exchange and secure remote web access. This works of course, but isn't user friendly.\n\nTherefore I would like to implement HAPROXY reverse proxy, there are a few reasons behind it (one being as SBS is involved - which with how picky this is with things, I would prefer to leave the current certificate installed on it and just pass through the reverse proxy), but I would like to use SSL pass through instead of terminating SSL on the proxy server. I currently use this on another install, so setup isn't a problem. \nWhat I would like to know is if I can expect any issues with SBS/Exchange in the mix or all should be good?\n\nThanks",

I took my time looking a for a new job because I wanted to make sure that I landed in the best spot possible. I applied for a part-time position (which turned out to be full-time) at a non-profit because I figured it could be something to keep me busy, two or three months went by, and I got a call from the interm executive director at the time.\n\nWe had a long chat about the past, present and what the future could look like for the organization. After our conversation, she put me in contact with the person that I would be reporting to; several weeks went by, but eventually, we were able to meet and get into the details about the job along with what needed to be done. I was intrigued by the technical challenge ahead.\n\nI gave him a start date, and he asked me about salary, I already knew the range (which is well below what I should be making) I told him I would require the max pay, and he agreed. At this point I've been working at this longer than I thought I would have due to overall situation. I'm the only IT person on staff, and they have a head count of about 40. They had a ton of issues (e.g. firewalls O.S. out of date & EOL, no vlans in place, etc.) all laid out on paper (300 pg's) thanks to a technical assessment conducted by 3rd party consultants prior to my arrival, I could keep going but just think of it as a huge mess x 3 locations. I have resolved a majority of the issues and improved this situation despite not having any budget at all, so many times I felt like I was up a creek without a paddle. They don't have funds to start an IT budget but I've been able to replaced all of the switches with HP gear (which came off eBay), leased new printers, new firewalls and AP's which came via a \"trade of sorts\", consolidated ISP circuits to save $ and simplify the work for the finance dept., implemented a WAN over MPLS, etc. the list goes on (over 30 projects).The organization still has some technical concerns that I have warned the management of but still no plans to address the issues. I've done A LOT by myself but I'm ready to get hell out and go work some where that is not poorly run and will pay me for having the knowledge of a CCNP, VCP, MCSE and someone that has good business acumen. The organization has been around for over 30 years, and they are known by a lot of people which could be a positive or negative thing.\n\nI have a interview coming up on Friday at entity that I'd love to be a part of, my question is what would be a good reason as to why I'm leaving if asked?",

And I legit don't know what to think about it.  It's bugging the crap out of me.\n\nThe interview seemed to go well in the beginning.  I was nervous for the first few minutes.  But I was able to calm down and relax.  I even noticed both the recruiter and the head of it relax once I did.  In truth, after the first 2 or 3 minutes I was smiling through out the entire interview.  I even noticed both the recruiter and the Head of IT reciprocate.\n\nI was able to talk briefly about my background.  Trying to focus on only what's relevant.  Talked briefly about my schooling and work experience.  And from there had a... about 50/50 conversation with head of IT.  And yet... after the 10 minute mark I was asked, \"So do you have any more questions for us?\"\n\nWhen I said, \"No not at this moment\" the recruiter ended the interview.  \"Well thank you so much for coming in.  We will let you know in a week or two!\"  The interview was at 4:00 pm and ended at 4:10.  What happened?  Where's the technical questions I spent all weekend studying and reviewing for?  That's it?\n\nFor the most part I can read between the lines.  And part of me is kicking myself.  Should I have asked more questions?  Should I have taken more initiative in the interview?  I'm just... I don't know.  I'm surprised and stunned that it only lasted that long.  If any of my superiors reddit has any insight please let me know.\n\nI genuinely wanted to work for the company and I don't want to make the same mistake(s) in the future.  If you have any insight i'm all ears.\n\n- bossrhino\n\nPost Script:  I also posted this in /r/itcareerquestions .  However I'm unsure if this is career related, per say.  Or a, \"Okay what the hell did I miss?\" question.  And one that I hope other /r/sysadmin residents may find useful.\n\nAlso, full disclosure, there were a few aspects that I'd never been exposed too. I'd hoped that with a little review and a bit of study i'd be prepared for the technical questions. When they didn't come... I grew frustrated. Also apologize if i'm rambling a bit. I'm tired.\n\nEdit 2: Thanks everyone.  The comments calmed me down quite a bit.  I appreciate everyone's perspective on the subject.",

Long story short I've inherited a home grown not HA/FT and does not scale web hosting cluster, and i'd like replace ASAP. The environment is Varnish/Nginx at the Reverse Proxy layer (no LB), no shared storage for the content hosts, a single MySQL server and it runs about 70% of the organizational web hosting. Which doesn't keep me up a night worried in the least bit. All new web environments must be created by hand, from the reverse proxy layer to the content hosts in this current setup. Needless to say deploying a new web application takes much longer than I would like to admit. I'd like to replace this with a much less homegrown cluster, automating server build process with Ansible/Jenkins including automating build on the web environments. \n\nI'm fairly happy with Nginx for my reverse proxy, largest issue I have is how users interact with their web environments. Currently they SSH into a server where their home directory is an NFS share from the content host of the application. If they need to restart the web app, they use a homegrown webtool that will remotely restart the process via an RPC to the content host. It hangs alot, requiring root intervention to reset. \n\nSuggestions would be very much appreciated! \n\nRough overview of current cluster: https://imgur.com/apfOlOv (forgive the poor sketch)",

A lot of what senior level technical people get paid for is their ability to research things quickly, navigate the bureaucracy at a company and put together solutions, work with other types of technical people (developers, DBAs, etc).\n\nA couple weeks ago I ended up talking to a junior admin who can't understand why he isn't getting promoted because he thinks he has incredibly deep technical skills in a couple of areas above and beyond even the senior admins (his words).\n\nHowever, what's keeping him at his current level is that he can't run a meeting, he generally needs help when communicating with different departments, he needs help proposing changes in ways that don't offend people, he needs help staying organized, and he needs help managing his time.\n\nThis is all stuff he can learn, he finds it totally irrelevant and wants to get promoted on Puppet and Linux skills alone.\n\nIf you have technical skills but you have to be kept on a tight leash and closely mentored through situations that require soft skills, it's pretty much impossible to justify any kind of promotion. Senior level staff need to be able to work independently.\n\nOn a scale of 1 to 10, a person with 7 technical skills and 9 soft skills is going to be a better senior admin than a person with 11 technical skills and 3 soft skills. Obviously a person with 3 technical skills and 9 soft skills is also going to be a lousy senior admin.\n\n(I'm already predicting someone will say that this guy is not appreciated and should leave and get a great high paying job somewhere else. He **IS** appreciated actually. Just because someone isn't pushed up to a level they can't be successful in doesn't mean they're not appreciated. Someone like that is obviously welcome to find a job elsewhere at any time, but if these are areas that require growth in their existing job, it's unlikely they'll go somewhere else and kill it, but people can make the choice that they think is best for them.)",

When confronted about it they responded with \"I thought we were allowed to be local admins on our own boxes\".\n\nI really can't believe I have to explain (and literally break it down Barney style) to a group of sysadmins (with over a hundred years of IT experience between them) how adding your standard user account to the local admin group utterly and completely defeats the point of forking the accounts, and that any compromise of their account now effectively compromises any other set of credentials entered on the machine.",

It ended up landing me a very profitable job with a company that hates IT but hates contractors and unreliability more. \n\nI'm a desktop tech, but have taken on some responsibilities in Windows AD and Policy. I've been with the company for several years now, and I'm getting the message that the expectation is for me to take on a more active and less \"button pusher\" role in shaping that AD structure and Policy (both are a poorly maintained snarl of a quickly growing company that has new \"standards\" every few months).  I'm balancing new user setups with \"get all X type accounts across the company the same.\"   I am interested in this kind of work, but challenged my boss at our last meeting about formal authority, (ie work *towards* a title change to reflect that I am the guy who *should* be working on this stuff rather than an uppity desktop tech) so when security team and others say \"why are you doing this? This isn't your job.\" I have someone backing me up in addition to my credentials (have some certs, working on more).  \n\nThe reply was, \"don't hold your breath. Just start working on it, and to avoid getting into that authority challenge situation, start having meetings with these people to say 'this needs to be fixed, who's going to do it?' and since no one is going to take on the responsibility, you can. Eventually you just become 'The AD Guy' and people come to you for that sort of stuff. But you have to be on top of your game all the time because if you screw any of it up and it comes to a real question of 'why was a desktop tech doing this?' you're hosed.\" \n\nI like a lot about the company, and I don't want to leave it (or the money for that matter) but I feel like I'm between a rock and a hard place of just sort of politicizing my way toward accomplishing technical work. And also lacking someone backing me up for making infrastructure level changes in a system that effects everything in the company at times. (we have testing and roll out procedures/change management, but again that question of \"why him?\" hangs over me). \n\nIs this normal?  Is IT often this nebulous scramble for responsibility or am I reasonable in expecting a more formal recognition of my responsibility to work in these environments? ",

I figured I would take my shot at creating an explanation of certificates, and (hopefully be able to) answer any questions you might have. The more administrators that understand the concepts the safer the internet becomes.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo... \n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Version 1 (Symmetric Key Encryption):**\n\nThis is encryption where 2 parts agree on a key and they can use it to encrypt and decrypt the same message.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*Encryption:* \n\nplaintext -> encryption(key) -> ciphertext\n\n*Decryption:*\n\nciphertext -> decryption(key) -> plaintext\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis is still used when the person encrypting and decrypting is the same person. e.g. encrypting a hard drive. The flaw of this style lies in having to communicate the key to all parties securely.\n\nWhich brings up...\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Version 2 (Asymmetric Encryption):**\n\nNow, as the name suggests, encrypting and decrypting require a different key. This is called a key pair. This means that you can encrypt using either key, and decrypt using the other. So...\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*Encryption using Key 1:* \n\nplaintext -> encryption(key1) -> ciphertext(1)\n\n*Decryption using Key 1's pair:* \n\nciphertext(1) -> decryption(key2) -> plaintext\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*Encryption using Key 2:* \n\nplaintext -> encryption(key2) -> ciphertext(2)\n\n*Decryption using Key 2's pair:* \n\nciphertext(2) -> decryption(key1) -> plaintext\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis allows us to give out one key and keep the other a secret. So say I keep key 1 and give out key 2. Great, you have just assigned key 1 to be your **PRIVATE KEY** and key 2 to be your **PUBLIC KEY**\n\nSo lets revise:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*Encryption using PRIVATE KEY:* \n\nplaintext -> encryption(PRIVATE) -> ciphertext(1)\n\n*Decryption using PUBLIC KEY:* \n\nciphertext(1) -> decryption(PUBLIC) -> plaintext\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*Encryption using PUBLIC KEY:* \n\nplaintext -> encryption(PUBLIC) -> ciphertext(2)\n\n*Decryption using PRIVATE:* \n\nciphertext(2) -> decryption(PRIVATE) -> plaintext\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo now that the two situations are different only by which key was used we can look at the differences.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n1) Encrypting using your private key means that anyone with your public key can decrypt it. Usually this is the opposite of what people want when they encrypt something, but this does mean one thing... That the recipient of the message can guarantee that the message came from you. **Congratulations, you just digitally signed a message.**\n\n2) Someone encrypting a message using your public key means that only you can decrypt it. This means that now, once it is encrypted, that message is secret. **Someone has just encrypted a message to you.**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAlright, now we are starting to get somewhere, but we still want to be able to encrypt a message to someone else, not just receive an encrypted message. Luckily all the parts are in place. To encrypt a message to someone else we just have to reverse the previous diagram and have the person we are communicating with send us their public key. So..\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*Encryption using other users PRIVATE KEY:* \n\nplaintext -> encryption( PRIVATE[user2] ) -> ciphertext(1)\n\n** This isn't going to be possible for us to do as their private key should never leave their system.\n\n*Decryption using other users PUBLIC KEY:* \n\nciphertext(1) -> decryption( PUBLIC[user2] ) -> plaintext\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*Encryption using other users PUBLIC KEY:* \n\nplaintext -> encryption( PUBLIC[user2] ) -> ciphertext(2)\n\n*Decryption using other users PRIVATE KEY:* \n\nciphertext(2) -> decryption( PRIVATE[user2] ) -> plaintext\n\n** Once again, this isn't possible for us to do, as we don't have their private key.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOk so this enabled two more scenarios for us.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n1) Decrypting a message user2 sent us using their public key. In this case anyone with the public key can read it so its no secret, but we can confirm that the message came from them. We just verified a signature.\n\n2) Last but not least, we encrypted a message using the other users public key, anyone with that public key can encrypt a message, but only user 2 can read it. Finally we can sent a secret message to user 2. We have encrypted a message.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis is what we have been looking for, but one problem still remains. There is a lot of keys, and the more users there are the faster that number increases, and if we haven't talked to this computer before how can we for sure know that they are who they say they are when they give us their public key?\n\nEnter...\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Version 2.1 (Public Key Infrastructure):**\n\nOk, so we have identified that we want to use asymmetric encryption, but we still can't confirm user 2 is who they say they are. So now, naturally, we want to ask someone else. Enter the Certificate Authority. This is the third party that we have agreed we will both trust. (or in most cases, whoever made your browser/OS/etc has vetted as a reputable third party as thats all they have to go by, their reputation). \n\nSo now, once again we have to be fancy and use encryption so the Certificate Authority generates their public and private key. But this time, we only care about one direction. The Certificate Authority encrypting to us. This means that they have signed a message to us and we can confirm that it came from them.\n\nOk, what do we care about them saying? The other users public key. So the other user sends their public key to the nice and trusted Certificate Authority, and they verify they are who they say they are, and hand them back a handy dandy **certificate** (you know I had to get to it eventually).\n\nSo what does this MEAN: Now when user 2 give us their certificate, I can check with someone I trust to confirm it came from user 2!\n\nThats all it is folks, a certificate is just a public key that, whoever we give it to, can verify came from us.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI know that has all been really long winded, and was a bit rushed, so I'll come back and edit as I can to make it more clear, and as people have questions. Please feel free to ask as many questions as you have, tell me where I am wrong, etc. The more admins that understand this and the deeper we understand this the safer our communications and data become.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTL;DR: A certificate is a public key that can be proven to come from who they claim they are.\n\nEDIT: When you request a certificate for your server, mark your damn calendar for when it expires. Maybe even create a script or monitoring service that will tell you it expires in a week, month, or however much lead time you need to replace it. \n\n\n",

My greatest work fear is that I'll be asked to rack a server by myself, or take charge of hardware, or show somebody else how it's done. I can now do things like replace hard drives, which, fortunately, have become hot-swappable and no longer require opening up a computer, but I regularly get stuck when I call tech support and am asked to open the chassis to try removing or reseating a part. I can open a chassis and identify parts, but I can't figure out how to access small parts. Even arranging cables stinks. Ironically, higher management seems to think my strong suit is hardware, or at least swapping hard drives.\n\nI also dislike other aspects of system administration, including backups and monitoring, installing and configuring software, and responding to user requests (creating accounts, out of disk space, need permissions changed). Honestly, it's all just kind of tedious. I use configuration management, and, while it makes things more manageable, it's still not something I want to spend time doing. \n\nI got into server administration because I happened to see the job posting for a sysadmin who also codes, or a programmer who also sysadmins. It was close by, and I had no other opportunities after failing numerous interviews for development jobs. My history consisted of a CS degree, a failed attempt at starting my own company, and an internship, but no IT or help desk experience. I wasn't even the type to build my own computers, and I'm still not.\n\nAt this point, when I apply for developer jobs, I either fail the interviews or get rejected because my programming experience is unimpressive or doesn't count. I'm not really interested in DevOps because of the ops part, but I did try interviewing for it once, and didn't have enough ops experience or experience with anything that scales. I haven't applied to other sysadmin jobs because the idea of maintaining more computers is utterly horrifying.\n\nAnybody else a misfit in the field but still read this subreddit? \n\n",

            "selftext": "I have a server running Windows Server 2012 R2, with one physical NIC and some Hyper-V VMs. The host has 3 external IP addresses. I've configured a Hyper-V switch on the host, assigned this a a static IP on the host, and connected a VM to this switch as well.\n\nI'd like to be able to configure NAT on the host so that I can assign 2 of the 3 external IP addresses to have their traffic sent to the Hyper-V switch, and have the VM attached to this switch receive this traffic.\n\nThe external IPs in this senario are:\n\n* 10.1.1.1\n* 10.1.2.1\n* 10.1.3.1\n\n10.1.1.1 is the primary IP address for the server. 10.1.2.1 and 10.1.3.1 are additional IP addresses I have purchased and assigned to the same NIC as 10.1.1.1.\n\nThe IP address on the host, assigned to the NIC connected to the Hyper-V switch is:\n* 192.168.1.1\n\nOn the VM, the IP address assigned to the NIC connected to the Hyper-V switch is:\n* 192.168.1.100\n\nI'm familiar with getting a setup like this running in Linux, but have never done this on Windows. I would normally accomplish this by setting up a virtual adapter, eth0:1, and assigning it the IP address 10.1.2.1 to it. Then apply the following iptables rules:\n\n    -A FORWARD -i eth0:1 10.1.2.1 -m state --state NEW -j ACCEPT\n    -A PREROUTING --destination 10.1.2.1 -j DNAT --to-destination 192.168.1.1\n    -A POSTROUTING -s 192.168.1.0/24 -j SNAT --to 10.1.2.1\n\nI've followed a guide from Dell for setting up a Windows Server 2012 R2 machine as a router - found here: http://www.dell.com/support/article/us/en/19/how10169/configuring-windows-server-2012-r2-as-a-router?lang=en\n\nAfter setting that up, traffic to 10.1.2.1 is indeed being NAT'd and sent on to 192.168.1.1, and my VM can see the traffic. Great! The problem is that traffic from 10.1.3.1 isn't being sent to 192.168.1.1.\n\nI was expecting something in Windows where you can say: \"Anything coming in on IP x.x.x.x, use NAT and send on to y.y.y.y. Anything coming out of y.y.y.y, use SNAT and send on to x.x.x.x\".\n\nI've read the technet article on using netsh to configure routing and manage nat (https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc754535(v=ws.10).aspx) - but so far I haven't found a way to add a single external IP to the pool.\n\nI feel as though this should be a simple task, but I haven't been able to get it set up. I'd like to add additional external IP address to the host, and NAT them on to the Hyper-V switch, but I'm stuck!\n\nHow can I get the host configured to perform NAT on selected external IPs?\n\nEDIT: drashna's reply raised an issue I forgot to bring up - this machine is in a datacenter that I don't have access to, and the provider can't add additional NICs. I also cannot make the Hyper-V switch external (bridged), as when I tried this the host was booted from the network. After a call to the provider, I learned that they don't allow this behavior.",

For the local apps that try to emulate a local drive connection, i've tried CloudBerry Drive, TNTDrive and which ended up being most impressive was Amazon's Cloud Storage Gateway as a virtual appliance presenting an iSCSI target locally, but cost goes up for that one. Other than the AWS Storage gateway the rest don't and won't natively support being able to share out their repository over a network for users to access alongside their primary daily data. Although i understand their design as this is not their goal, i'm stuck on how i can take advantage of these cheap data costs and make it available for the office without needing to register all the users or have to deploy and manage another desktop app for everyone to access and figure out for that pocket of data (For ex.

            "selftext": "Hi everyone. This is a continuation of my [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/6yuyvj/ssrs_2012_report_manager_error/). You can read previous answers & edits there, but I will try to put most relevant info in this post. \n\nBrief overview:\n\nI have been trying to pinpoint an issue that has been occuring each morning (*has established a pattern of occuring in the mornings when production arrives, roughly - 6 to 8 AM*).\n\n**The problem:**\n\n - The SSRS Report Manager will error out with the following message: \n\n - The server is slowing to a halt, half of the time the slowness creeps beyond SSRS into other SQL applications & the server GUI, but the memory usage is not always high %. \n\n- Restarting the server fixes the problem & it doesn't occur until the next day (in the morning).\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\n- Most recently, I am thinking it has to do with a SQL Agent Job (**syspolicy_purge_history**) that is failing at 2AM each night. We just found this. We spent too much time looking at SSRS and it may actually be unrelated to SSRS. \n\nIt gives this error when the *syspolicy_purge_update* fails:\n\n*09/12/2017 02:00:03,syspolicy_purge_history,Success,2,MLNS-002,syspolicy_purge_history,Purge history.,,Executed as user: NT SERVICE\\SQLSERVERAGENT. The step succeeded.,00:00:01,0,0,,,,0*\n\n\nThere is another wording of the error message on my previous [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/6yuyvj/ssrs_2012_report_manager_error/).\n\nThis job began failing on the day before we had issues with the server.\n\nWe initially thought it was SSRS misconfigured or being overloaded, or being jammed up by a bad report. But it seems like (if this job failure could cause the issue) SSRS is running slowly because the syspolicy_purge_history job is failing.\n\n**Some Things to Try**\n- I checked for SQLPS in the SQL Server install folders, I didn't see it in the specified installation folder: *C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft SQL Server\\110\\Tools\\PowerShell\\Modules\\SQLPS* or any other folders for SQL. The environment path for PSModulePath is set to *%SystemRoot%\\system32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\Modules\\*. Powershell was an item that got uninstalled & needed to be re-installed when the failed updates were applied that caused this mess.\n\n- I can try [this](http://guidestomicrosoft.com/2015/01/13/install-sql-server-powershell-module-sqlps/), to install the needed powershell components for SQLPS.\n\n- I have seen people needing to change the execution permissions on their powershell modules. Does this sound correct to anyone? \n\n**EDIT    (updated with Server Details)**\n\n- System Manufacturer\t*Dell Inc.*\n- System Model\t*PowerEdge T630*\n- System Type\t*x64-based PC*\n- Processor\t*Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2630 v3 @ 2.40GHz, 2397 Mhz, 8 Core(s), 16 Logical Processor(s)*\n- Processor\t*Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2630 v3 @ 2.40GHz, 2397 Mhz, 8 Core(s), 16 Logical Processor(s)*\n- BIOS Version/Date\t*Dell Inc. 1.5.4, 10/4/2015*\n- SMBIOS *Version\t2.8*\n\n- Memory    2x32GB (64GB total)\n- Disk Layout     RAID 5 (4x7200RPM HDD) for a total of 2TB of space. \n\n",

He asks me to show him how to check backups, so I stop by.  We can't log in because he can't remember the password.  I don't remember it either, but he chose it as something he would remember.

I know I can reset it if I can get to the Windows folder from a command prompt window.  \n\n\nWell, I can boot to the install CD and get to the command prompt window by selecting \"Repair\" near the beginning, but I can't change the files I need to change on the hard drive because no hard drives are found (undoubtedly because drivers aren't loaded).  I can load drivers during the OS install process, but there's no opportunity after that to get to a command prompt, just to install the OS.  \n\n\nIt's a Dell PowerEdge T130 running Windows Server 2012r2 Foundation, and it's using UEFI, the LifeCycle Controller, and software (S130) RAID 1 - a mirrored pair of 1 TB drives.  \n\n\nBest approach?  1) can I slipstream the S130 driver onto a DVD with the W2012r2 files and get it to load first?  How?  What tools do I need?  2) Is there a 3rd party disk (like Hirens) that I can use to boot and get to the hard drive in a command prompt window?  3) Or is there some other method that will work?",

Something where I can deploy dozens of them to various separate clients and access them fairly easily, remotely.\n\nThis would be super useful for me when I have several dozen clients, all of them separate and unique, with their own individual servers that don't have any out-of-band management capabilities.

            "selftext": "We have been having ongoing wireless issues for several years and I have worked with our wireless vendor Aruba until we basically ran out of things to try.  \n\n\nThe issue is basically that wireless clients don\u2019t always connect to the network.  Most of the time they are fine, but randomly they wont connect.  Sometimes a reboot fixes it, sometimes not.  Eventually it will work, and we never know what client it will happen to.  We have done packet captures and nothing seems off.\n\n\nAs a test I got some test Meraki AP\u2019s recently and have them setup using a totally different radius server to try to eliminate that being the issue.  I came to one of our buildings to test a cart of laptops.\n\n\nOut of the 22 laptops 3 of them did not connect to the network successfully.  All the rest worked perfectly fine.  Below is a rundown of what happens when a client doesn\u2019t work correctly.\n\n\n* Client laptop boots up\n\n\n* The laptop will login using cached AD credentials otherwise they would get the error message that the domain controller cannot be contacted.\n\n\n* Do an ipconfig once im logged in and the laptop gets an ip address of 169.254.1.70\n\n\n* If I go to active directory dns in the our domain in forward lookup zone I see that client has an a record in place with a valid IP address\n\n\n* If I do an ipconfig /renew on the laptop it gives me an error that it was \u201cunable to contact your dhcp server. The request has timed out\u201d. \n\n\n* Sidenote on one client I tested doing a ipconfig /renew immediately got a valid dhcp address\n\n\n* I turned wifi off and back on and it got the same dhcp address  with all the appropriate dns servers listed in ipconfig\n\n\n* In the Access Point log the client first gets that IP address then it goes to the 169.254.1.70 address.  Im not getting any radius errors on the AP log or on the radius service itself.  The authentication seems to go through fine.\n\n\n* Within the dhcp console the record was there as well\n\n\nSo while it was always believed to be a wireless issue it seems that using the Meraki equipment that the wireless system is not the culprit nor is radius.  Do you have any thoughts as to what might be happening?  It\u2019s a tricky issue to troubleshoot because it is never just specific clients.  The issue has happened on Windows 7 and 8.1 and 10.  Many different laptop models and network cards.  And everything works ok for 90-95% of the clients.  We don\u2019t ever have an issue with wired clients.\n\n\nOne other factor is that we don\u2019t use and active directory DHCP server.  We use a third party dhcp server for this service.\n\n\nWe have just kind of lived with this issue.  And unfortunately we have a lot of labs where random people log in at any time so cached credentials arent always available.\n",

They have two displayports and a VGA in the back. Had a user who needs dual monitors. Okay great, I'll pop a couple DP to DVI adapters in and hook up the monitors and avoid using an additional graphics card. Nope. Windows does not detect the second monitor. Only one at a time in either display port OR the VGA port. These machines should have Intel HD 630 integrated graphics, but Standard VGA Graphics Adapter is the only thing showing in device manager. No driver updates available from Windows update. None of the drivers on Lenovo's site are applicable. Drivers from Intel's site say they are not applicable when I try them as well. Running Windows 7 x64. Original set of drivers installed on the machine were from Lenovo's SCCM driver pack for that model. The hardware ID for the gfx adapter is PCI\\VEN_8086&DEV_5912&SUBSYS_310217AA&REV_04\n\nGoogling the hardware ID is usually a dead giveaway, but this time it's not proving fruitful. Any pointers?

I know lots of people don't make any cable, so I guess I should just keep buying these? Should I still have something to make emergency reparation on a cable, or just try to have enough spare?

Whenever I need to reboot a node, even if the reboot process is relatively short (a minute or two), the storage repair and regeneration jobs copy an excessive amount of data. Like 4 - 5TB every single time. The amount of data churn during these reboots has been minimal (<10MB /sec). Is this to be expected? I seriously doubt my workloads are changing 4 - 5TB worth of blocks while the one node is down for a minute or two.\n\nEdit:\n\nAssuming a best case scenario here, it has a 256KB stripe, and 4TB worth of data would be 15,625,000 stripes. And assuming 2 minutes of downtime that would mean the active node would need 4340 stripes changed per second, and assumes that every single IOP touches a unique stripe, be in such an order to keep all the disks under load, that the IOs were 4K, and that the IOPS would be 100% writes for this to make sense. Due to how small the write cache is on the node it can be safely assumed to have filled up quickly and can be ignored for this calculation. This would mean that each 7200RPM HDD would need to be capable of 542 IOPS which they certainly arent. Even if the write cache was empty before the node went down, it would only buffer maybe 25% of the IOPS before filling up. So the amount data which could theoretically even be written to the disks under a full load during the downtime in no way justifies how much data is being resynced during the repair/regenerate process. And from watching the disk activity lights on the active node during the downtime I know for a fact it is no where near a full load.",

I'm completely overwhelmed by the amount of choices and things to consider.

When I ask specifics about what they want their reply mostly is along the lines of \"We want you to research what's the best approach\". The only real guideline I have is that I know the software which needs to run on the deployed workstations.

I found that for a new user, it takes two logins for the file association to actually kick in. I saw this one the Adobe site:\n\n> Limitations\n> 1.The end user machine needs to be domain-joined for this method to work.\n> 2.Users can change the file associations during the current session. However, admin settings are reinstated at next logon.\n> 3.As of 5th Feb 2016, it is a known limitation of Windows 10 that when new user is created on the machine after enforcing the GPO Policy, then on first login ownership is not set. However, the correct settings are applied on subsequent logins.\nhttps://www.adobe.com/devnet-docs/acrobatetk/tools/AdminGuide/pdfviewer.html\n\n\nAnybody else came across this and know where I'm going wrong? Wanted to double check before telling people \"oh yeah, you need to login twice\". Wouldn't really be too much of an issue if people used the same machines, but they dont...more or less a free for all.\n\nEdit - I should also mention I tried to \"Disable fast logon optimization\" as well, but that didn't seem to make a difference \n",

The user account will then need to be locked down to where the user cannot delete or add other printers. The group is in their own OU and I believe that a combination of GPO and GPP is the right way to go.\n\nThe Issue: How do I get the GPP to delete all printers to precede the GPO to enforce no adding and deleting printers? If the GPO runs before the GPP won't the GPP delete the proper printers that need to be mapped?\n\nThe Desired Outcome:\n\n1. Delete all Printers and Print Drivers (Mapped, Local, and Print to PDF like Services).\n2. Map the Desired Two Printers.\n3. Enable GPO to Disable the Addition and Deletion of Printers.\n\nI am excited to hear what this community comes up with, THANK YOU! in advance!",

I'm posting this to reddit from the hotel tonight, so my apology for the lateness (or early, I supposed depending on area of the world!\n\nHopefully you get a chance to read this lengthy.  It's a goodie and part 1 of 2.\n\nArticle Link: https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/askpfeplat/2017/09/11/securing-privileged-access-for-the-ad-admin-part-1/\n\n> Hello again, my name is still David Loder, and I\u2019m still a PFE out of Detroit, Michigan. I have a new confession to make. I like cat videos. Your end users like cat videos. You may like cat videos yourself. Microsoft will even help you find cat videos. Unfortunately, cat videos may have it out for you and your environment. How do you keep your environment secure when malicious cat videos are out there, waiting to pounce?\n\n> Microsoft has a significant amount of published guidance around [Securing Privileged Access](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/securing-privileged-access/securing-privileged-access) (SPA), [Privileged Access Workstations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/securing-privileged-access/privileged-access-workstations) and the [Administrative Tier Model](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/securing-privileged-access/securing-privileged-access-reference-material#ADATM_BM). My fellow PFEs have also contributed their own great thoughts around these topics. Go browse through our Security tagged posts to get easy access to them. As for myself, I was staff IT in the security department for a large, global corporation, prior to joining Microsoft, where we operated in a tiered administrative model and had implemented many, though not all, of the defenses highlighted in the SPA roadmap. So I\u2019d like to share my perspective on the items in the roadmap and the practical implications from an Active Directory Administrator point of view.\n\n> But first a caveat for this series of articles. I love the SPA roadmap. I espouse its virtues to all my customers and anyone else who will listen. But there are times where the SPA roadmap takes a big step, and I know it can sometimes be difficult to get the people in charge to agree to a big step. In all the cases where I point this out it is possible to take a smaller step by limiting the scope by focusing solely on AD. I have a different purpose for this series of articles than the SPA roadmap itself. I want you to actually implement the guidance. That\u2019s a shocking statement, I know. Despite all the guidance, I still walk into environments that haven\u2019t implemented a single piece of this guidance. Maybe they don\u2019t know this guidance exists. Maybe they think they aren\u2019t a target. Maybe they think the guidance doesn\u2019t apply to them. My hope with this series is that a few more people know about the guidance, understand why they should care and have an easier time convincing others in their organization that the roadmap guidance should be implemented. Security is a journey. Through no fault of your own, the rules have changed. What you did to secure your environment yesterday is no longer sufficient for today\u2019s reality. So, let\u2019s get started.\n\n> **Separate Admin Account for Admin Tasks**\n\n>This is an easy one, right? Nothing about this guidance is new. It ranks right up there with not browsing the Internet from a server. But I am constantly seeing environments where normal user accounts, which have a mailbox and browse the Internet for cat videos, are also in the Domain Admins group. Stop this. Stop this now. You need a separate credential for administrative tasks. Come up with a naming convention and a process to get an admin account for anyone who does admin work.\n\n**...**\n\nContinue the article [here!](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/askpfeplat/2017/09/11/securing-privileged-access-for-the-ad-admin-part-1/)\n\nUntil next week, when we complete this article with Part 2!",

Yes, we get a notification that the \"sender failed our fraud detection checks\" but is there a way to see the true sender? Right now, we are blocking senders to stop the spams but if the address is spoofed, we cannot block the sender as it will block an employee from sending. We are looking into getting a better spam filtering service. Any ideas?",

However some sites block all ICMP...\n\nThese sites return a spinning wheel/timeout - if we drop the client host MTU down to what is expected the connection works fine.\nIs there a way to deal with this? Assuming all of the tunnel / MPLS MTU settings are correct but the client has no way to determine the MTU from client to server because the server blocks all ICMP packets?\n\nI am at a loss as to how to communicate to the client that the MTU is less than expected when the remote server does not respond to ICMP. All of the local MTU / IP MTU / IP TCP ADJUST-MSS / MPLS MTU commands have no affect...\n\nThus far, the only way to resolve the issue is change the client host's MTU or provide a 1500 byte MTU....\n\n(This is why I hate tunnels.)\n\nI may be able to provide a 1500 byte MTU transit - but it will require the reload of a half a dozen switches and the reconfiguration of twice as many routers.

The thing is, our system images and all other management techniques are controlled through domain policy and all that. Updates are managed through WMI (I know, I'm sorry!) and a bunch of custom inventory too. This would also mean bypassing them off the SSL bump + network based AV and all the filtering. This will break tons of things and make everything more difficult obviously. The kicker? No admin access even on the computers outside of the domain. The users will have admin access and we will need to have their permission to work on their computers. \n\nAt the same time though, I see where they're coming from: IT has some sort of default trust and has access to everything because we have to be admins and have such powers to keep things running smoothly. Is it even possible for me to be a domain admin but also not have access to sensitive user data? My intuition says no, unless users manage their own data on encrypted volumes (and even then with remote control we could push out an attack which reads data off the encrypted volume while they're using it, obviously not saying I would but it's in the power of a DA). \n\nWhat do I do? There hasn't been an issue with previous IT people stealing user data and all that and I'm pretty sure that this whole thing is coming from the fact that we revoked local admin privileges a while back as we transitioned to domain based control. Do I try and fight this (it's a maybe, I don't really want to do this) or do I shoot myself in the foot and leave the users to keep themselves secure?",

The skill is knowing enough to ask the right question, to already know what you are looking for in a sense and having a good knowledge of the basics to the intermediates.\n\nIf you just google who to script to pull data from a CSV, you probably aren't really learning the process or the proper way to do this.  You are going to hit stack overflow, try dozens of things out until you get one close enough to what you want and then tweak it.  When once you found the module/function/method/class/whatever that parses CSV files you should have just read the manual for it.  To see if that is really what you are looking to do.  I just used CSV as a random example.  I didn't want to open a rabbit hole of specifics.  \n\nInstead of doing this you should be reading the documentation.  You should be learning how to do things, not copying things off the Internet.  You are just really teaching yourself shortcuts, and while I do agree Google is a very powerful tool, and I use it myself all the time, I take my time to read the documentation.  I want to understand what I am dealing with, not copy and paste stuff. A lot of times I end up researching something else because I started off by asking Google the wrong question to begin with.\n\nReally your \"Google-Fu\" should be all about how to efficiently use Google's less known features.  Like searching for a specific site, or search string manipulation, etc.  Not finding an answer you copy/paste.    \n\nWhile I may be splitting hairs on this, I do think it is an important distinction and mindset to have.\n\n**#EDIT**\nI am sure this will be downvoted into oblivion...",

            "selftext": "Hi all!\n\nAt work we have two sites, each with their own servers, including an identical 45drives NAS box running CentOS at each. These are used for our Veeam backup targets and other various archival purposes. We would like them to cross-replicate, so that in a DR situation, we could restore from the other location's NAS. We have an MPLS between the locations to do the replication over.\n\nDo you guys have any recommendations for software, paid or free, to handle the replication process? Currently we use rsync with NFS mounts between the two on a cronjob, but we're finding it hard to manage, with no decent status monitoring available. I've also messed with syncthing, however it seems to crash randomly and hasn't been reliable at all from my testing. Duplicati doesnt seem like much of an option either as it's built for backup, not replication/synchronization.\n\nWe are using ZFS, and I've seen that GlusterFS can do geo-replication, would that be something to pursue?\n\nAny insight would be helpful. Thank you!",

Its affecting multiple campuses, different employee types and numerous machines (In the dozens, at least). We cant find any commonalities between the workstation installed apps (besides universal programs McAfee, MS Office, and a LanDesk agent). \n\nWe know windows updates were recently rolled out, but have no particular evidence to point at that specifically.\n\nWorkstations are inconsistent; force-rebooting, logging in and back out will sometimes reproduce the issue, other times it won't.\n\nWe have determined that disabling the SENS service (as suggested in [this](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/windows/en-US/3b73a8f0-672e-4446-bb82-541f0c7fc977/sens-causing-slow-logoff-on-some-domain-win7-clients?forum=w7itproperf) technet article) seems to resolve the issue but we don't understand WHY. \n\nAny thoughts?",

            "selftext": "I've posted about this project before. We use a third party tool to add signatures to outbound emails for our users. So, we have to block their ability to add their own signatures in outlook to prevent emails from containing 2 signature blocks. We have completed rollout for a script that does this on windows machines. However, we are beginning the rollout to our international offices, and for some reason, those offices insist on using Macs.\n\nWhat I did for windows, was create a .bat that checks the registry for certain keys. For example if HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Office\\16.0\\ existed, it would this value (reg query HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Office\\16.0\\Common\\MailSettings /v NewSignature), essentially creating a new blank signature in outlook. And then it deleted any files existing in %appdata%\\microsoft\\signatures\\...\n\nThe main problem we had, was that our users are distributed. Some are in our offices, some are 100% remote workers. So, they're not always hitting the domain. We have Kace, and I used Kace to push this script to all windows PCs, and this worked like a champ. I only have maybe 10-15 stragglers out of the 4000 or so PCs that were affected. Totally manageable.\n\nNow, as I said, I need to come up with something similar to work with Macs. This shouldn't be a problem from the Kace end of things, but where I'm running into issues is basically my lack of knowledge when it comes to the Mac OS. I have found some things that have pointed me in the right direction, but I don't even know how to script on a Mac. What I've been able to get so far is this:\n\nosascript -e 'tell application \"Microsoft Outlook\" to disable signature'P\nchmod 555 ~/Library/Group\\ Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/Outlook/Outlook\\ 15\\ Profiles/Main\\ Profile/Data/Signatures/\n\nBut none of that will run in Terminal on my test mac that I have here.\n\n\nAny suggestions?\n\n\n\n**EDIT**: If anyone is interested in this, I'm posting my solution here.\nI've created a script that will be pushed from Kace to a new label we have created for our international AND Mac OS machines. The script is as follows\n\n    #!/bin/bash\n    osascript -e 'tell application \"Microsoft Outlook\" to delete signature 1'\n    osascript -e 'tell application \"Microsoft Outlook\" to delete signature 2'\n    osascript -e 'tell application \"Microsoft Outlook\" to delete signature 3'\n    \n    cd /Library/Group\\ Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/Outlook/Outlook\\ 15\\ Profiles/Main\\ Profile/Data\n    chmod 222 signatures\n",

            "selftext": "Hi there,  \nSo we currently are figuring out a way to change the way we store our projects folders and I've come to a crossroad as to which solution to go for.  \nWe have around 2.5 TB of data across all 35 users. It ranges from simple word documents and excel spreadsheets to >100mb docx, autoCAD files and SIG databases.  \nMy two options right now are a NAS (with another as a backup) or the same thing but with a SAN.  \nMy main concern is the speed of access and having 35 users connected to the system with multiple files open between all of them.  \nFor what I could understand the SAN solution would also mean that I need windows server licences (is this right?) while the NAS has it's own SO and makes that part more \"budget friendly\".  \nI'm also looking for something that is easy to future proof by expanding HD :/  \nWe have a Windows Server for AD and a SQL Database  \nThe files are stored on the users computers with daily backups and that's the part we want to change.  \nRight now the project manager's computer keeps the project files and whoever (any person from the 35) is working on the project access the folder for work.  \nWhat we want is to move just the project folders to a centralized solution.  \nBudget would be something bellow $20k.

Doesn't matter what the application is but from an IT perspective, what infrastructure questions should IT be looking for? (I'm sure my boss who has been in IT for 18 years will know) but I want to find out for myself. \n\nOn the company end we should be asking for the vendors disaster recovery plan, a try before you buy option, if they meet critical security and compliance requirements, asking for case studies, service level agreements, price protection, etc.\n\nOn IT's end we should be looking to see if our current infrastructure is capable of hosting it here correct? But getting more granular, what should we be looking for exactly? Server load? Bandwidth? We are either having this in house or hosted I believe. Again, I'm sure my boss will know this all but I enjoying finding things out on my own.\n\nWhen looking at new tools, applications, resources for your company, what is your process?\n\nAny help would be kindly appreciated!

Running the batch file on the server itself works fine.\n\nWhen I try to use psexec to run this same batch file from a terminal (Windows 7 Professional) at our site entrance, the batch file seems to run however only about a third of the report comes out the printer (about 12/13 names).\n\nI've tried to run cmd.exe using psexec and running the code within the batch file that way with the same results. I know it's not the printer as I've tried with the same results on 3 different printers.\n\nDoes anyone have experience using psexec or any ideas on what may be causing this? I'm puzzled, yet I feel there is something obvious I'm missing.\n\nThank you",

            "selftext": "This absolutely burned me today. Last weekend was the cutover date for a group I manage from one email system to G Suite for Business. A bunch of people didn't actually want web access to their emails, they just wanted them autoforwarded to their existing accounts.\n\nI set up the accounts in G Suite, logged in to them (while the accounts were still empty) and set up the autoforwarder. The recipient email address gets an email  saying \"Hey, is it OK if the source email address sends all of their email to you? Click here if it is.\" Then the user clicks it, then you're good to go.\n\nOr so I thought.\n\nWhat Google does is they add a line with a radio button for \"Forward incoming mail to [other address]\", but that radio button IS NOT SELECTED. The other one is selected, for \"Disable Forwarding\". You have to log in a second time to click that one, so that it actually forwards.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/yS0mqCu.png\n\nI did that part this weekend. I had to send credentials for web access for all of the users that didn't want them, so they could catch up on all of the emails they missed between last weekend and this weekend. Very frustrating. Does anyone know of a better way to do this?",

I downloaded the ISO, used Rufus to place onto a USB flash drive, and booted a physical server with it.\n\nThe very first screen in setup asks for a 25-digit key.

It seems like while the ISO is correct (others have demonstrated using it just fine) that something is up with my setup. On top of that, based on others feedback, installing Hyper-V Server sounds non-standard, and most install full Windows Server anyway. \n\nAs an additional possibly contributing factor, the USB drive I was using to as my installation media literally just failed - it's possible that it was failing when I was first trying to install Hyper-V Server and I just didn't know it. I don't have any other USB drives on me today, so I'm going to burn a few DVDs, and if I still have trouble, I'm going to go the Windows Server route.\n\nUPDATE 2: Burning the ISO to a DVD worked.

            "selftext": "Hi guys. I'm looking for opinions, maybe a few uplifting comments but basically I just want to vent. Hope that's okay. \n\nSo I work with a large telecommunications provider. I did my apprenticeship there, they wanted to keep me so I stayed and I'm with them since 2006. \n\nI'm not an expert in anything, more a 'jack of all trades'. I'm sure many of you can relate - I've read it here quite often. \nMy job title is 'Systems Engineer' and I handle basically our VMWare and Hyper V virtualization environment including storage (HP LeftHand but that'll change soon since its EOL) - switches (HP and Cisco), firewalls (CheckPoint and FortiGate), Windows VMs, Linux machines, several webservices and databases (IIS, Apache, Oracle, MSSQL and MySQL). \n\nSure this sounds great but you all know that you have to be extremely gifted to do all those things on a certain level. So I've been winging it here and there and it always worked out. I've been praised for my work. But I've got the feeling that I don't have the skills to do all these things properly... because it's just too diverse technology wise. I can find my way around Linux, dig through some logs, troubleshoot a bit. But for the life of me I can't script anything but the most simple stuff. \nI can set up a VMWare cluster and propagate iSCSI storage to it after setting that up and clustering it and all. But it just feels kinda off to me...\n\nThe company has the whole package. 30 days paid vacation. Paternity leave (2 months, paid 65% of salary) Every minute I work overtime goes into my 'time account' (but I don't do much overtime) and I can either go a little earlier, take days off and whatnot. I have a pension plan, I work from home 3-4 times a week at the moment (which is great with two kids!). My workload is maybe 70% productive on a good day. When everything is running and our ticket system is quiet I can slack around.... which I do sometimes. Married with two kids and 11 years with the company, they can't ever fire me. Except radical reasons like I steal from the company or something. \n\nSo this all sounds great, right? \nWell... the pay isn't all too great... I make 50k after 11 years there and you can easily live a good life here with two kids going to daycare and a quite nice rented appartment as long as my wife also works. \n\nI know my worth on the market is more. It's been confirmed several times and now I've got an offer with a company that's in my hometown. 10 minutes walking distance. \n\nThey offered me more than I was asking (that never happened before, everyone wanted to haggle and offer less!) and it would be a huge bump in salary (66k). I have the paperwork here and I'm just about going to quit on Wednesday (first day back after my vacation)...\n\nSo I know nobody can really tell me what to do here.... But maybe some of you can chime in and tell me - would YOU do it? Would you leave the giant comfy company that would probably be my first and last employer until I retire or would you stay and just relax and accept the lower pay and sometimes boring work?\n\nThanks guys... typing this out already lifted some of the weight I'm feeling. Hope to hear from some of you. Have a good one!",

Every time a user logs in for the first time on a new device, it takes up to 5 \u2018till 15 minutes before someone can start using the computer. \n\nThe teachers in our school teach in different classrooms and they should always have a familiar workspace. Therefore we chose to use folder redirection (Desktop, Appdata, Documents, Favorites,  Links and Searches)  . We chose as setting 'Basic - Redirect everyone's folder to the same location' and redirected to a Share folder on the server.\n\nWe also set 'Allow or disallow use of the offline files feature' to Disabled.

            "selftext": "Howdy all,\n\nI received a flurry of SPF & DKIM failure reports yesterday from a few of the big domain names. Gist of the failure is that the ip sending the emails claiming they were from my domain didn't match my published records, so they are rejected. Since my configuration is such that I get reports, these reports were delivered.\n\nBest I can tell, the IP is some provider in Canada and there was, at least at one time, a WordPress install. So I'm figuring someone's box got owned and they tried, but failed, to send emails as a non-existent user account on my domain. The email was definitely a phishing attempt looking at the raw file.\n\nI contacted the provider at their abuse address hoping to resolve the issue since there were several attempts at that ip, and I couldn't glean anything too useful from nmap. Also realizing that if there are any providers out there *not* enforcing the SPF check then this email would have gone through to the recipient, which is truly unfortunate.\n\nJust to be safe, I ran checks on my domain and everything looks ok from an SPF and dkim validation standpoint. My legit mail gets delivered through all the big names, no relay capability, strong tls configs and I'm not on any spam lists. This particular box had been running for 6 years and it's been one of a long lineage since the 90s - but this year is the first time I've really had to deal with spam beyond just using greylisting - and knowing there's people out there who are actively trying to spoof my domain is also a bit unsettling. Also knowing there is great potential for an unknown number of successful deliveries is disturbing.",

The situation being I have a user that gets a god awful amount of large attachments like large blueprint PDFs that he needs to retain for potential contract conflicts in the future.  He's managed to nearly fill that 50gb of storage now.  I was looking into the Exchange licensing plans and my understanding is Plan 2 allows unlimited archiving.  From the site it appears it's only twice the price of plan 1.  \nI made the proposal and was told that we can't get Plan 2, that it would cost more than the site says it does.  When the heck does licensing costs increase above the advertised costs??  That just doesn't sound right to me, but perhaps I am overlooking something?\nThe proposed solution I was given is to work with the user to help them manually archive and show them how and put it on an external drive.  So far the time I've seen my coworker put into this plus the cost of the drive, plus the users downtime seems like it would have paid the cost of a couple years of licensing at this point.\nAm I crazy or would it not be more efficient to upgrade the license and use the unlimited online archiving instead of manually archiving to an external drive?  \nI'm pretty sure my coworker goes out of his way to do these manual things to create an illusion of being busy and productive...\n\nEdit: The latest excuses they gave me are email shouldn't be used as archiving..... Wow..... And they can only get Plan 1..... It should be possible to have a mix of license levels on your users with this right? or am I missing something?

A backup tape from 10 years ago has data on it probably from 10-13 years ago.  I do not have the hardware or software to read the tapes any longer.  An attorney wants to know if we have electronic files and emails on something during a period of 8-12 years ago.  Am I allowed to say yes, but I can't access it?  Am I allowed to say no because I technically can't get it?  What scares me is I probably could if given the time to find the right tape reader somewhere, the backup/recovery software used and magically remembered the password used when the data was backed up, but I can't guarantee that either, in fact the chances are pretty low.  So just because I *might* be able to access the data, does that mean I absolutely have to find a way even if it might be futile anyway?  \n\nAnd yes, we're in the middle of developing and implementing a real retention policy that is going to include destroying most of these tapes.  Of course Murphy's Law kicked in and we were asked for something before said policy kicked in officially.

            "selftext": "As most of us on /r/sysadmin do, we like stories of other people's mishaps. Especially on a Friday, here's one.\n\nThis, here is a live example of why we should *not* make any kind of changes on a Friday, even if they are minor.\n\nI'm the sole IT person at a SMB with 4 sites across the country, and about 85 employees. I started here in December. I'm based in our headquarters, which happens to be our smallest office (about 20 users)\n\nOne of the decisions made by my predecessor was to be cheap and install unmanaged 24 port Netgear gigabit switches. They've been needing replacing for a long time, but it was on a low priority for financial and time reasons.\n\nThen, a few months ago, one of the Netgear switches starts failing, I replace it with a spare in the closet (the same model Netgear), temporarily. Now I can make a case to my boss that we need new switches for our office, I tell him the situation, and he still puts it on the back burner.\n\n\nNow, as of 3 weeks ago, the fans started revving faster than usual, so I tell my boss (again), and now he agrees to buy new switches.\n\nI ordered 3 26 port Cisco SG200's. \n\nFedex dropped them off today, and I did some quick configurations (we don't have a super complex setup, no VLANs, but I did set up STP, SNMP, Static IP, hostname, etc), then I decided to install one of them this afternoon, keeping in mind that today is Read Only Friday, but I wanted to take a bit of a risk.\n\nI move the patch panel up by one U, and I install the switch in to the rack, and then I get a complaint from a user that her internet is down, I confirmed that there was no link, and I went to her connection on the patch panel, still intact, on both ends, and I confirm on the old switch that it's still physically connected and intact. I try unplugging and replugging the cable back in, nothing. I almost gave up and reverted my switch install, but then I decided to plug her connection into the new switch, and bam... link lights. I'm convinced this is just a coincidence, but there's no other explanation, my installation didn't impact any of the wiring.\n\nAfter that situation was resolved, I slowly moved everyone to the new switch and removed the old. \n\nThen, we had two other users complaining they couldn't get online, turns out I forgot plug the network connection for the existing switches, oops. I reconnected the two remaining switches.\n\nI then decided to just rack the second switch (no moving connections over, yet), and then I stopped for the day. \n\nI'm going to finish the rest on Tuesday (Read Only Friday extends to Monday as well, because my brain is still half fried on Mondays).\n\nI like to take risks sometimes, but this was probably not one of the smartest risks I took. Even though this was a minor change, and only 3 people were affected, it was still unwise to do any kind of change like that on a Friday.",

Backwards, but OK. \n\nGoDaddy assured her no issues would be presented, and I would agree that an Account Merge should not cause DNS Downtime. \n\nUltimately, GoDaddy screwed the pooch and lost all the DNS records for the Domain #1 during the account move. Luckily they have 1 website and Office365 so it was all very easily retrieved. It also gave me keys to Public DNS and I documented all records available (they did have a 2nd Domain in Account B, but Name Servers are with AWS, and no issues were seen with Domain #2). \n\nIs anyone familiar with merging accounts with a Registrar agree that account swaps/merges do not take down DNS?

Checked e-mails to / from my personal gmail.com account to, so all good.\n\nThis is when I ran the spoof test again, and the e-mail turned up from webadmin@mydomain.org as it did before.\n\n    SPF:\tPASS with IP 192.254.121.248 Learn more\n    DKIM:\tPASS with domain knowbe4.com Learn more\n    DMARC:\tFAIL Learn more\n\nSo it failed DMARC but sent it anyway, as it should due to the dmarc none policy.\n\nWhy did it pass SPF? [This tool](https://vamsoft.com/support/tools/spf-policy-tester) with the IP address above and webadmin@mydomain.org says it softfails, which it sholud due to the ~all part of the SPF rule.\n\nWhen gmail says SPF PASS, could that actually be softfail? and it's doing as it should, and I just need to up the dmarc policy?\n\nLooking at the SPF rule [this tool](https://mxtoolbox.com/spf.aspx) shows gives me the include:_spf.google.com causes the following SPF rule to be included:\n\n    v=spf1 include:_netblocks.google.com include:_netblocks2.google.com include:_netblocks3.google.com ~all\n\nEach of those _netblocks resolves to a set of IP. Presumably googles mail server IPs.\n\nSo my question with all of this, is would anyone sending a mail through one of gmail's mail servers auto pass SPF? I assume that is fine, since google would then reject the DKIM step?\n\nSorry for the wall of text, any help would be appreciated.",

There will be a Palo Alto PA 3020 there as well, but that may wind up being ignored.\n\nI'll also need an iSCSI network to communicate with our iSCSI SANs.

            "selftext": "**TL;DR: Does your IT department maintain logistics accounts (FEDEX, UPS, etc.), and if so, to what degree?**\n\nI manage the IT department of a small architecture business of about 150 employees.  We have a printing company that ships out a lot of drawings to various places all the time, and they handle 100% of that shipping.  But, we still ship things ourselves from time to time, and so we do have a corporate fedex account that is, unfortunately, in my name right now.  This means my name is on every single label we print, return to sender shipments end up in my office, fedex salespeople are constantly trying (unsuccessfully) to talk to me, and fedex calls me whenever there's a problem with a shipment (even though I know nothing about what's going on with it).\n\nI'm toying with the idea of talking to our principals about moving the responsibility for this account because I do not think it falls under the IT umbrella.  I personally don't ship very much, and honestly know next to nothing about how shipping really works beyond the basics.  I didn't set up our account (that was my predecessor), but I did overhaul it when it needed some maintenance.  This is pretty much how I got into the responsibility for it - because my name was literally on it and everybody else was scared of a big, bad fedex website.  However, I'm tired of dodging salespeople, and so I think it's time to either hire a logistics person, or promote somebody else into the role.\n\nThe thing is, I don't want it to seem like I'm trying to shirk responsibilities, and I hate the idea of giving somebody else here more work.  I'm just struggling to see how managing a fedex account should be an IT responsibility.  We already do the \"not IT but it's your job anyway\" things like security, but at least that involves equipment of some kind.  All fedex needs is a clunker computer and a thermal printer (which fedex maintains).  However this is my first time actively managing IT for a company, so I'm not sure if I'm in the right here.  I suppose my question is: Does your IT department maintain logistics accounts?  And if so, do you manage the whole thing, or is some of it delegated, and to what degree?",

The security reports I see each day usually show that it has blocked numerous port scans, RST floods and actual attacks that are targeting specifically those servers (Exchange and the webserver).\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\nEDIT: I forgot to say one of my firewall rules is: \"WAN > LAN from ANY to [public IP] - Allow All\". I'm thinking I should find out what specific WAN sources (if any) I could specify to lock this down further. Because right now, ANYONE can pull up our webserver (which isn't even serving up an actual public website).",

I went on vacation and this occurred (normal).  I attempted to add my work profile and I received this:\n\nOops!\nWork profile can't be created because you've reached the maximum number of users on your device.  Remove at least one user and try again.\n-----\n\nPreliminary troubleshooting was:\n-sent an enterprise wipe to the device\n-uninstalled airwatch, reinstalled\n-attempted to sign in and received the same error\n\nI left the issue alone for some time, uninstalled airwatch and just put activesync back on my device.  Then I noticed something strange -- airwatch appeared in my apps list! so I did the same thing:\n-sent an enterprise wipe to the device\n-uninstalled airwatch, reinstalled\n-attempted to sign in and received the same error.\n-clicked out of the error\n-attempted to sign in WITH A TEST ACCOUNT and received the same error\n\nI looked through the files on the device and tried to find /Android/data/com.airwatch.androidagent but no luck.  I searched generally with any file containing airwatch, no luck.  In opening certain files, I still see the option to open using my \"work\" account.  when I tap on the option, nothing happens.  My device must be holding some trace evidence of this account...\n\nI am certainly fine with factory resetting the device, but I find that to be a horrible solution to something that wasn't caused by user error.  We're currently testing airwatch for our environment and if this ever happened on the phones of our users, it wouldn't be good!  Has anyone run into this?  Does anyone know of certain files that store airwatch data on Android devices?\n\nEDIT 1: some formatting.",

Expected version: 10.6**\n\nIt occurs after a day or so - usually in the morning when we try to run any report in Report Manager.\n\nThe report will load (forever) to finally result in that error in the results pane.\n\n**Some possible solutions I have seen online:**\n\n- Restart SSRS\n- Restart SQL Agent\n- Restart Both\n\n- Disable page-break for report (but I think this would apply to a single problem report.) Our issue is for all the reports on Report Manager.\n\n- Clearing disk space for the Report Server (where do I do this?) I think our disk space is fine, though? How can I check - is there a specific amount of HDD that is assigned to it that I need to adjust/check?\n\n**Things We've Tried**\n\n- Restarting SQL Server\n- Restarting SSRS\n- Restarting SQL Agent\n- Restarting combinations of them (including all of them).\n\n- Restarting the whole server. This usually works, but we are in need of upgrading our server hardware (It's running RAID5 from the previous guy, so it's slow to reboot).\n\n**Some Possible Causes**\n\n- Recently a developer gained access to our server (for the last time) and accidentally uninstalled several features from the server. We had to reconfigure a few settings in IIS because of this, but the settings were minimal to get everything working. This issue began about a week later.\n\n- Is it possible that is a single report that is being run that is causing the issue? If so, is there a way for me to view in some logs what reports are run at certain times (by default or enabling logging)?\n\nThank you for the help!\n\n",

The objective of the audit is to see, in summary form, how we are doing and where we need to improve. I'll note that this is not a witch hunt, just a desire to have visibility into the IT department's strengths/weaknesses for planning purposes and projecting out what needs budget for next year.\n\nI'm wondering, for those who have done this sort of task, how did you launch into it?\n\nHave you built an audit framework and then filled in the details? \nJust written down \"good\" and \"bad\" lists and attributed values to categories? Did you use some kind of guide? A workbook or a 'quiz' that scored answers? Some kind of software suite that builds a report when you put in information?\n\nAny thoughts on a good way forward - preferably one that can be standardized and worked through annually - would be beneficial. Thanks in advance!\n\nEdit: Clarification: The examples of information that I got as guidance for creating this internal audit was my boss describing a 'score card' of sorts, with information about VM system architecture, network layout, file share design, DR strategy/implementation, backups, and other things in that realm and how good of a job we are doing with each of them. He wants things to be in green or in red, so that he can point to them and tell senior management where and why we need to spend money, or point to them and be able to explain that this red area is why X broke yesterday.

I can even see the ARP reply back to the VM for the gateway when doing a wireshark capture but it never shows up in the client's ARP table.

I'm by far the most senior person working here, but I'm not a senior guy (I've only been doing contracts for about 4 years now).\n\nOne fellow, in particular is Very green, as this is only his 2nd contract positional he just graduated out of college this year. We will call him @Spoons.\n\nHere's the scenario: myself, @Spoons and one other contractor went to set up a new office for @NewUser. It couldn't be any simpler. But when we arrived, there was a problem;  Someone occupied that office.\n\nNo big deal, we walk down to our office and I ask @Spoons to send an email to the person who created the ticket in the first place, for clarification on what was happening.\n\nI give this task to @Spoons, so he can get more familiar with working in a professional environment. Well, that's sort of a lie, I didn't want to do it, so I told him to.\n\nHe writes a nice concise email, detailing the issue encountered, asking for clarification. And @Spoons asked me to read over it. I gave my approval and then went back to doing what I was doing.\n\nA couple minutes later @Spoons interrupts me and asks for some help, he's having a hard time finding the contact to send the mail to. Figuring he wasn't the most familiar with office, I directed him to do a search through the 'to' button. So he does that, and is still having issues.\n\nI come over and examine it a bit more in detail. Well, it turns out @Spoons was trying to send the email to @NewUser...\n\nWith a minor percussion maintenance to get his logic function working, I corrected the issue.\n\nTl;Dr new contractor attempts to email person who isn't working for the company yet demanding to know why she supplied the wrong work location.

I've setup an EC2 instance in AWS with Veeam installed on it and am replicating my backups to a repository on it, so the backups are physically sitting on that EC2 instance.  My question is about how to most efficiently restore those backups to AWS instances.\n\nAs best I can figure, I can use Veeam to restore the VMX/VMDK files to a temp location on the Veeam instance in AWS, copy them into an S3 bucket, then use the AWS CLI to import those VMDK files to a new EC2 instance.  Haven't tried it yet, but in theory it should work.\n\nThe real issue I have is that the VMs in my prod environment have static IPs configured on them.  If I restore a VM to AWS (where the IP scheme is totally different), I'm assuming I'll have a VM running that I have no way to access since it has no network connectivity.  Is there some way I can reset the network settings back to DHCP, either via Veeam as part of the VMDK restore process, or via AWS when I import the VMDK?\n\nI see that ec2-import-instance has a --private-ip-address switch where I can specify an IP.  Does this actually reconfigure the Windows configuration of the resulting instance to use that IP, or is it basically just creating a DHCP reservation so when Windows asks for an IP it'll receive the IP address I set?",

The party locked a (recent--and I emphasize recent) client's domain, server, and end points with a cryptoware.  They hired me just today as a liaison & contractor for them.  I established a dialogue with the party responsible and negotiated down with all the machines in question.  Unfortunately they still had to pay a large sum, but not as much as they were originally.  Which is somewhat good news? Eh!?  I was able to facilitate the funds in BTC and we're just now waiting for the reply.  This is never fun.  Letting them win is never something that sits well with me.  Unfortunately no backups were in place before I arrived.  So there was no choice but to comply.\n\n\nThey are a company in the middle of no-wheresville cartel hub city, Mexico.  Which brings me to a set of questions (someone out there may think these are stupid questions, I'm sorry) hopefully someone out there has addressed this set of questions before to some degree.  I'm sure some of you may have lived through the large NAFTA migration.  \n\n\n* Is there a way to acquire hardware and software vendors who efficiently deal in northern Mexico?  (They're not far from a border town)  Or will I have to cross everything over?  For the record, there's hardly anything better than a Best Buy across the border.  If so, what should I worry about?  Imports taxation?  \n* Regarding the online hosted Office365.  I'm telling myself this is a stupid question, but I need to make sure.   Does it matter that they operate in Mexico?  Will I have to worry about any unforeseen operational difficulties?  Or is it just a straight DNS/MX config and go? (They currently utilize a self hosted solution which is provided by a linux box sitting in some ghetto colo I assume somewhere in Northern Mexico, which is the reason they are in this position to begin with.  Some enduser opened a spam document they weren't supposed to.)\n* Are there ways to effectively backup without using Datto or any other online vendor?  I've considered a data redirection on the domain with a linux NAS, constantly ( every hour or so ) running an rsync cron sitting on some obfuscated configuration invisible to the others in the network... Considering offsite backups will be a challenge.  Any input on this considering the operational challenges would be appreciated.  I'm so used to fast internet. :-\\\n* Regarding Crypto.  I was hired to make sure if this happens again, that they won't loose this sum again. Are there new updated standards of protocol, whitepapers, etc that I should be reading before I start?  Just trying to update my brain.  Redundant question.\n* Do you have any suggestions, ideas, or input to add to this conversation? \n\n\n\n\n   ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n\n\n* -- Operational Challenges\n* -- -- DSL, Load Balanced, possible T1 low grade internet.\n* -- -- No hardware/software vendors physically within any proximity.  Closest vendor in the states would probably be within 3-6 hours away from the border.  \n* -- -- Possibility of theft from police/government/thugs (have to consider possibilities for thousands of dollars in equipment)\n* -- -- Theft via a break-in (reinforcement of server room will be in place)\n* -- -- Possibly no enterprise level network infrastructure (residential grade networking equipment).  I'm not worried about the terminations or category cable.  But this might turn into a larger job than expected.\n\n\n    ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n\nTLDR,  U.S. Citizen doing a job in Mexico.

Then I noticed that the version of Flash we have installed for Firefox and IE is slightly out of date. (26.0.0.137).

Chrome Components is saying the Flash plugin is up to date, but Adobe Flash Settings Manager is saying the PPAPI version is slightly out of date.\n\nI thought Chrome bundled its own version of Flash?  If that is the case, shouldn't it have priority over any other version of Flash?  Screenshot below\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/GwD50",

Had to delay cutover day for a week because she realized literally 5 minutes before I was going to flip the switch that her multi-colored categories would not be migrated over from Exchange Server 2010 to Office 365. And it's only gone downhill from there...\n\nAs I said, we converted this company from a hosted Exchange 2010 solution to Office 365 Exchange Online. During the conversion, we also performed a domain swap - so emails went from user@contosothefictionalmicrosoftexamplecompany.com to user@contoso.com. The new domain was set up as primary email and the old domain was set up as an alias so everything would continue working while they notified contacts of the address change. \n\nThis conversion also took place in the middle of a hardware upgrade from Office 2010 on Windows 7 to Office 2016 on Windows 10. The user mentioned above was butthurt that she wasn't in the pilot group for new PC rollout, so concessions were made and she was first. Thence commenced the whining...autocomplete in Outlook 2016 needed to be updated for internal users only (there aren't that many of them - less than 20.) Rather than risk a meltdown worthy of a cranky 3 year old by resetting the autocomplete cache, I told her to manually type in the full email address of only the internal users and that would fix it. And she did (bitching and moaning the whole time.) And it fixed it. Then today rolls around, and to her abject horror she realizes Outlook on her iPhone was still screwing up autocomplete, WHICH SHE JUST CHANGED!!!!!1!!!!!juan!!!!11!!! So I start researching, and I find out the answer isn't quite as easy as it should be...it seems as if Outlook for iOS has nearly no user base, and a pretty extensive Google search turned up not very much that I wanted to hang my hat on. As best as I can tell, Outlook for iOS pulls the autocomplete cache from OWA? And Outlook for Windows streams it down to a file on the desktop. And they're not the same by a long shot.\n\nSo, tl;dr: What's the easiest (best, whatever) way to fix broken autocomplete entries in Outlook for iOS for Office 365 without simply resetting the whole damn autocomplete cache through PowerShell (because that might make the hurricane that's about to pass by us look like a gentle breeze if her workflow gets jacked up one more time...)\n\nAnd any comments related to putting up with such behavior being a bad idea are duly noted and have already been raised. Unfortunately, <insert circumstances I can't really discuss here> keeps me and pretty much everyone else from being able to tell her to perform certain sexual acts on herself in response to her completely unprofessional and childish behavior.",

            "selftext": "Hello /r/sysadmin, been a long time since I wrote an actual post.  Earlier this week yet another IT Manager thread popped up and yet there was another time [This Article](https://www.computerworld.com/article/2527153/it-management/opinion--the-unspoken-truth-about-managing-geeks.html) - Opinion: The unspoken truth about managing geeks.   While I think this article has some merit and I do think the intentions of this article are meant to be positive and a good thing, I think it just misses too many points.   /u/anarchicforce mentioned they would like to hear more of my thoughts on this, and here is my [OP](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/6yf2yt/it_managers_out_there_tips_and_advice/dmnz397/) on that post.\n\nSo a quick background of me.  I have been working in IT for almost 2x decades.  Started in the late 90s doing Novell/Windows stuff and Desktop Support and hardware repair.  I landed my first job straight out of high school with zero experience as I was going into college at 18 years old.  Since then I have had many different jobs, worked internationally in both Europe and Asia, been a consultant, worked for tech companies, worked in vendor space, and earlier in my career worked for a school system and the local government.   I now work for a large well known company which I will not name.  I have never been officially a manager before, but I have had people report to me.  I have been lead on many projects.  Basically I have done some manager type stuff, but never the HR part.  I have never done reviews, discipline, or any of those type managerial duties.  I have done a lot of the planning, scoping, business engagement, and mentor to people under me.  I am based in Silicon Valley and I do 100% Linux and Mac stuff 0% Windows Microsoft stuff, infrastructure, services, apps, middleware, integration, tooling, cloud stuff, etc.\n\nThe opinions of that article linked above are very different from my experience and my opinions.   In fact, I would say while some of it is true, and some of it is accurate, it ultimately creates an unhealthy work space for IT professionals.  It also perpetuates bad practices and dysfunctional IT.  This is me not talking shit on every company out there either, trust me, every company has its dysfunctions and esoteric problems.   This is me having been privileged enough to actually work under some great leadership, and grow as a person and professionally.   So, what worked for me, and what I view as a good set of high level areas for leaders to focus on to create a productive, happy and healthy tech department.\n\nSo here they are in no particular order:\n\n* Build a team.   Do not try to silo your IT pros into specific roles.  You can split the services, but not the roles.  What I mean by this is that there should be a support service and an engineering service.  The support service does the customer interaction.  They are the help desk, desk side support, hardware techs, field techs, and all the escalation points you have for each of those roles.  They support the customer.  The engineering side builds things.  They build workflows, infrastructure, meet business requirements, implement projects and so forth.  The teams on those services should work as teams.  Do not silo a person off and say you are the mail server person, and you are the firewall person, and you are the software deployment person.  Instead have the team work as a team.  Have them cross train, discuss, plan and implement things at a project level together.  Let each of them have a say, and each of them be able to put effort and input into everything the team handles.  You can have SMEs, you can have leads, but let the team make decisions.  If there is an issue where a decision cannot be made the SME or owner or whatever decides.  You will accomplish so much more as a team than you ever will with one or two people being silo'd off doing their own thing.   \n\n* Do not call your end users, end users. Call them ~~customers~~ coworkers.  IT provides many services, and while a lot of times they are not customer facing to the public, they are customer facing internally.  Your end users are your ~~customers~~ coworkers and you want to make them happy.  You want to enable them to do their jobs.  You are their colleagues and their partners in the organization, do not forget that, and drive that culture in.  Edited this post due to /u/WhiskeyRider69 's suggestion on changing the mindset from customer to coworker and I like that better.  However, this might be splitting hairs since I have heard the term \"customer\" a ton.  Either way keep the old view of end user out.\n\n* The Managing Geeks article talks about being right as a currency.  That IT pros will often let egotism and elitism slide if someone can produce a high level of good work.  This is such a toxic thing to allow to happen.  Check your ego at the door.  No one wants to work with a jerk, and this type of behavior only creates a toxicity and resentment.  Instead of working under the currency of right vs wrong, as an IT leader you need to enable your teams, you need to inspire them.   When I look at where I want to work, I ask myself is my leadership enabling me?  Do I have access to all the tools, training, resources, and everything else I need to be enabled to do my job?   Is my team supporting me, and am I supporting my team?   If you want top talent at your Org, enable them to be top talent.  Do not micromanage, do not set the vision or the tone on every single thing.  Let them self drive their work.  I create 80% of my own work in our JIRA board because I am enabled to do so.  I am constantly improving things left and right because I am enabled to do so.  I will collect data and test changes in our testing environments and collect data off of that, because I am enable to create my own work.   Sure I get requirements from management, but I am never told how to meet those requirements.  Instead I am just enabled to do my job, and so is everyone else on the team.  As a team member enable your coworkers to gain skills.  For example I have taught several people who were new to my team Python.  Anyone who comes to my team has some sort of coding skills, but not always Python and we do a lot of tooling in Python.   As a member of my team, if you aren't up to snuff on your skills I will mentor you, I will help you as best I can.  At the same time, each team member needs to grow and learn.   Leadership needs to really drive in the culture of enabling your employees, coworkers and customers.   \n\n* Peer review is such an important thing.  No one on the team should ever QA or review their own work.  Someone else should.  Don't get caught up in the ITIL CAB stuff.  That stuff is honestly a waste of time.  I have dealt with change advisory boards that are so hung up on the power and the process it has halted my work from being done, and some of it was critical work (deadlines, security issues, known CVEs, etc).   So unless you have a really top notch kick ass CAB, that fully understands the all the stacks your teams work with, you are really just wasting everyone's time.   \n\n* Have a solid process.  How does someone in an engineering role go from Dev, to QA, to staging, to prod?   What is the process?  How do things get validated and tested?  Once you figure that process out, try to automate as much as possible around it.  You will make mistakes, you will fail, that is inevitable, do not worry about that up front.  Each time that happens it is an opportunity to make things better.  You learn much more form failure than you do success. \n\n* Team vs Individual vs Management - so if the team fails at anything, first and foremost the manager has also failed.  As a leader you just need to accept this.  Do not blame individuals, do not scapegoat people.  Own it as a team.  If someone on the team is truly a problem there should be HR processes in place to discipline them or whatever.  If the team is successful, mention the entire team, and always say it was the team not a person.  The problem with many IT pros is that they have egos and control issues, this even goes for management too.  \n\n* You should aim to work a 40 hour work week.  If the people cannot do their jobs in a 40 hour work week something is broken and as a leader you need to fix this.   Burn out is real.  I have been burned out before at a few jobs.  No one needs an IT hero and IT heroes are a bad thing, not good.  In fact you should really aim to have all the needed work done in a 32 hour work week so you can give your team some flex time for R&D and training on the job.  I know that is even a bigger pipe dream, but hey aim for the stars and maybe at least you'll land on the mountains.   \n\n* Ticket systems are horrible, do not use them at all for engineering or project tasks.  Tickets are for customers and are for support tasks.   Get some project based software, and look at using Agile (or something like Agile) to plan out and build your process.  It really is a game changer.  Please note though that Agile, while not as bad as ITIL in my opinion, but it can be.  Agile is meant to be a framework do not treat it like a religion.  Tickets create a transnational and reactive IT staff.  Project based IT creates a more proactive and more product IT staff.  Watch [this keynote](https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa15/conference-program/presentation/limoncelli) at the bottom of this page to see what I am getting at.\n\n* Just because things have always been a certain way, doesn't mean they should.  Likewise just because you can do something doesn't mean you should.  Just because you don't understand something doesn't mean it is wrong, and just because you do understand something doesn't mean it is right.  My point on this bullet is that you should always be evolving, always improving, and always pushing your team to learn and gain new skills.   If you aren't automating with code you are already 15+ years behind the curve, and that is not a hyperbole.  Also get rid of the dysfunctional stuff that IT classically does to itself.  You are only hurting yourself doing archaic and bad things.   \n\n* You have to dog food all your solutions.  You need to use what you produce, ship and release.  If you do not like your own workflows and environments you have created, odds are pretty high your customers also hate it.\n\n* As a manager you need to get the leadership above you to buy into what you and your team is doing/accomplishing.  I can't tell you how much of a major difference that makes.  When I meet with VPs and the rare occasional C-level and they buy into what our teams are doing, and they fully support us.  It makes such a huge difference on so many levels.   Middle managers are honestly the worst as a generalization.  They often get this chip on their should and then go wage a Game of Thrones political war against every other middle managers to climb to the top.   Not every middle manager can be promoted, so they all want to out do each other.  I don't care how much you convince me you are not like this, every single middle manager I have ever worked with in any capacity has done this to at least some extent, or the very least they think about this.   Do not be this person.  Instead focus on tuning a well built team that fucking gets shit done.   Trust me, once you do that and your team starts delivering it only gets better from there, you end up out performing other teams, and sometimes all the other teams.   Remember it isn't a contest though, that is just simply the benefit from running a healthier IT shop, that enables people to be experts at their job, versus a dysfunctional manager that doesn't.\n\n* As a manager go to conferences with your team.  Attend keynotes of people in their field.  Learn as much as you can about what other Orgs are doing.   This is important so you can understand why the team you manage wants to do things.   Plus if you are putting an effort out there to grow and learn yourself you are leading by example, which is the best type of leadership.\n\n* fight for your team to get going market wages, and benefits if you want employee retention.  I have left 2 jobs in my life that were fantastic jobs.  Great bosses, great work environments, lots of freedoms but absolute crap pay.   So if you want to attract top talent fight for what top talent is worth.  If you cannot get approval for top talent, then formulate plans and enforce cultures to get mid level talent and build them up.  Sure they will leave once they gain those skills and experience for something for more money.  That will happen, you cannot stop that.  However, you can still accomplish the things you want by being that type of leader, and perhaps that will help you build a case to the higher ups to actually pay and give benefits that attract top talent.\n\n* give people breaks.  If a team member is having a tough time, stressed out, or maybe a personal problem.  Tell them to take off a few hours early, give them an extended lunch, take the day off, whatever you can spare give it to them.   You as the leader need to set the culture of health first before the job.  That working smarter is better than working harder.   that you actually give a shit about your team.   I get it that you may not be able to do this for everyone every single time they have something come up, but when you can do it.   Do it with out question and do it with out hesitation.   An employee will not forget these acts pretty much ever.  I can remember every single time a great manager stuck up or went out of their way to help me.   I have forgotten over half of the bad managers I have worked with, but I do always remember the good ones.  The fucked up part is, the good ones and those moments were rare not the norm, which is why we remember them.\n\n* Priorities of things - If everything is high priority then nothing is high priority.  This goes into the whole build a process bullet I posted earlier but I feel this has enough special merit it should get its own bullet point.  Thanks to /u/Karrad for reminding me of this.   The process of priority needs to be clearly defined.  Both at the support and the engineering level.  At the support level what constitutes as a high priority or a severity 1 ticket?   If everything is a sev 1, then you just made sev 1 meaningless.  What are your SLAs and expected turn around time for a standard support ticket a customer puts in?  Now on the engineering side this needs to do mainly with the order in which projects should be completed and it should be weighed by dependencies and business needs.  If your main project is to stand up a new service you probably need to do other work before you can stand it up, there needs to be testing, and all of those things.  Priority should apply to an order of operations and dictated by the most important and pressing of the business needs down to the nice to haves.   As a manager you really need to drill this in.  Do not make everything a high priority because in all honesty not everything is a high priority.\n\n* Know the business you are in, and make sure you do things for the Org that make the Org successful.  Thanks to /u/Jeffbx for reminding me of the most basic thing I forgot to add.  I just assumed that was a given.  Assess the risks, qualify and quantify the stake holders, collect data, and make decisions that benefit the Org, not necessarily IT.\n\n* don't assume things, see previous point.\n\nThis is about all I wanted to write at this point, feel free to upvote, downvote, tell me I am an idiot, or that I make a good point or ask any questions.    I am not here to change minds but simply share my opinion through my experiences.\n\n**EDIT** - added a few things from the comments that I think are great suggestions I missed",

Heavy use of Visual Studio 2017, all Windows machines, no one has admin rights.  They are planning on using a plugin called Xamarin and in order to compile iOS code they need a Mac machine to act as a build server.\n\nWe do not support Macs and have no Macs in our environment, but we were willing to look at options.  But then we were told that to connect to the Mac with Xamarin through Visual Studio requires the user to have full admin rights on the Mac.  This shot up red flags and brought a hard stop to the discussion.  We do not give out admin rights on any machines on our network to students.  The lab itself is networked and managed by IT, and the Mac has be be on the network with the rest of the lab for them to connect to it so we also can't just pull all of the machines off of production network.\n\nI was hoping to get input if anyone else has run into similar situations or possible resolutions they may have seen.",

The primary software requires quite a bit of supporting software as well as the ability to reboot as needed, so I'd like it as a separate VM rather than on our standard RDS Server. I naively thought that it must be cheaper to purchase a single Windows 10 Pro/Enterprise license for this purpose rather than an entire Server license, but it's turning into yet another Microsoft-fueled nightmare.\n\nI'm working with a VAR who I love, and who has helped with MS licensing many times over the years, but they're apparently struggling a bit on this one. They first quoted a Windows Enterprise Upgrade + SA (KV3-00262), but stated that it required a preexisting/underlying OS license. Obviously, that doesn't exist in this case since I don't have a Windows 10 OEM license on my host. Now, they're suggesting a VDA subscription, and I'm waiting for pricing on that.\n\nWhat am I missing here? I purchase Server licenses, I worked out what it takes to reimage OEM-licensed desktops, and I can even purchase boxed FPP versions of Win10, but what the hell does it take to run *one* instance of f*#&ing Windows 10 Pro as a virtual machine???\n\nEdit: We don't have a VDI setup here, but how is what I'm trying to do significantly different than if I had a single VDI instance? I can't imagine that licensing Windows through VMware Horizon View is anywhere near this difficult or expensive, and don't you have even more functionality going that route?",

I've had some issues with Office 365 users periodically being asked for their email address when launching the apps.\n\nThe resolution that I always found was to switch your install from Deferred, to Current Branch.

This occurred for nearly all of our users.\n\nI then did an Online repair, and had same issues.\n\nI then did an uninstall, and a full reinstall.  Same issues.  I moved to a different Virtual Machine (Golden Image on another Physical Host), and had the same issues after a full re-install.  \n\nOddly enough I can right click on a subfolder and open in new window and not have any issues.\n\nI saw similar posts referencing different Microsoft KB's, but I did not have any of those installed on these servers.  (KB3178664, KB3191932 & KB4011052 were common ones.)  Since this is an Office 365 install, those updates don't seem to apply, as there are no office updates listed anywhere in Windows Updates.  My understanding is that those are down automatically via some sort of direct push, not through manually checking for updates. \n\nAny help is appreciated!\n\n*Slight Update:  I looked in Event Viewer a little deeper and am noticing these errors from today, which definately makes it sound like the updates aren't applying.  I'm looking at this now:\n\nWindows update  could not be installed because of error 2359302 \"\" (Command line: \"wusa.exe \"c:\\program files (x86)\\microsoft office\\root\\integration\\windows8.1-kb2999226-x64.msu\" /quiet /norestart\")\n\n**Update 2:  I see the KB2999226 as having been installed on July 14th.

He needed a basic IT/helpdesk guy (fixing computer crashes, installing hardware, solving internet issues, etc), which I feel comfortable doing. He also wants me to move into network administration. The business uses the G Suite administration service. I've picked it up quickly, it's pretty straightforward. I do have some schooling towards an associate degree in network administration, but only about half way done.\n\nCurrently the company's network is set up using Microsoft accounts to log into Windows 10 machines, with websites/g suite filling in the gaps. This leads to having to assign all 27+ employee logins to every new computer. It's a headache now, but it will be a disaster if the company continues to grow. I've told my boss that he will most likely need a server and to run an actual domain instead of his system. I feel about half prepared to do this at some point (have ~8 months of experience with using Windows server from school, and have completed 3 of 4 courses for CCNA prep), but I think I would either need him to hire someone who I assist or to spend a fair amount of time in a test environment developing it before deployment.\n\nMy main questions are:\n\n- How critical do you think it is to move to a company server?\n\n\n- If it's something that should be done, would AWS/Azure be viable options? (he seems to be really attached to the \"can login from anywhere\" aspect of the Microsoft account. I explained to him that servers can accomplish this with a VPN, but he seemed dismissive because what he has is working now)\n\n\n- Finally, what resources/training can I look into to get better at my job and be more qualified when I move forward to my next place of employment? (I'm being underpaid for the work based on what I've seen the market paying for what I'm doing, but at the moment I'm fine with it because I need the work history badly).",

We're replacing a server in our environment and going to be deploying Server 2016 Datacenter. I'm a little confused on how to handle the licensing. Datacenter (as I understand it) Comes with 16 core licenses, anything past the 16 physical cores in my host and I will need to license those as well. \n\nNow, where I am confused is, in a 28C server, I would need an additional 12 core licenses. The supply chain my company uses for many things including materials for our end customers gives us a discount, the cost of the 16C DC license is less than what it would cost for the 6x 2C license packs. Can I purchase a second copy of 2016 DC to license the last 12 (and have 4 cores left, minimal issue I'll eat for a few $K less than the packs) or will I have to buy the extra core packs to cover my ass? I would assume buying the second copy of DC would be enough to cover me, but M$ always have some backasswards rules for random things.",

            "selftext": "Did a revision to one of the segments in one of our databases. For sake of simplicity...there are about 200 different segments in this db that vary in size. My boss requested that I make a specific revision to a setting in segment \"x\" (one of our biggest data segments in this db). But I warned him that it's not good practice to revise that setting after the segment is created as it can disrupt/break other areas of the segment. Further, making this revision is more of a personal preference (of my boss) than a practical/operational requirement. I warned him again, in a polite manner, saying that we should just keep it the way it is and do testing on another less important segment. Well, he said \"I don't want to do all that and have to spend time testing. Just go ahead make the revision.\" Again, I warned by saying \"Are you absolutely sure? Not trying to be difficult, but this may very well break the segment.\" He then said \"Don't wait another minute. Revise it now.\"\n\nWell, I took his orders and made the revision and I now have to correct the broken segment. I have to do a complete rebuild which will probably take most of this morning. It's not difficult, just very tedious and it's taking time away from my other tasks. (Even though I'm taking 10min to type this haha).\n\nI told my boss that the revision broke it and he said \"How did it break it? There's no way. Did you do it right? Are you serious?\" Then he got annoyed that the segment is down. Yes I did it right and NO you cannot restore/revert back to it's previous state. Once you change the segment, it's DONE. That's why it always says \"ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO PROCEED? ANY REVISION MAY/MAY NOT AFFECT THE CURRENT SEGMENT.\"\n\nYou may say \"Why can't he fix it?\" Well, he doesn't know how it works so I have to do it.\n\nUghh....is it Friday yet?",

I can at least run a gpupdate and the account doesn't get instalocked.\nThere was a tattooed gpo on the server.  I was able to find a hint to this Desktop Authority crap in a gpresult /h and then ran a custom event viewer for the millisecond it bombed to then find the GUID and then I searched the registry and deleted all entries involving that GUID.  This seems to be more of a semi fix as there is definitely some other things going on with policy on the server and their workstation which will probably require a rebuild, but at least the user won't need to call me every hour about their account being locked.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAfter looking through many logs and taking some suggestions below, I'm 99.9999% my issues are from some old software an old sysadmin installed years ago.  If anyone has any knowledge of getting rid of Desktop Authority, please let me know.  I've uninstalled it, deleted remaining files, and deleted registry keys, but it still locks the user out when a specific server boots up or gets a gpupdate.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nHi All-\n\nJust started a new job where the systems where glued together by software engineers.  Well, I've started setting up some best practices and fixing all the issues that come along with invoking them.  I just setup Account Lockout which has never been enabled in this environment (crazy, right?).  Well, I'm having one of the strangest issues I have come across with accounts locking and am now at a loss.\n\nI have a handful of users, all software engineers (so no one from marketing, sales, accounting, etc.) getting locked out seemingly randomly throughout the day.  The one I've been working on the most I've noticed some oddities with their lockout.  Here is what I've done\n\nI created a simple powershell script so I could find logs of the lockout on a DC and pinpoint what computer was locking him out.  I first kept seeing his computer locking him out immediately at login.  I ran a gpresult and took a look for any old login scripts or weird GPOs that would be applied to his computer and even user object.  I backed up and removed a bunch of scripts just sitting in NETLOGON and disabled a bunch of old GPOs that honestly looked very broken and probably never worked the way the creator intended (i.e. computer and user policies with only user objects in scope) which none of this worked.\n\nI walked away and worked with another user on a ticket they submitted (oh the joys of being understaffed) and when I came back to my desk I had a call from them saying they were locked out again.  I found this time it was from a Win 2008 R2.  At the exact millisecond of their account getting locked out there is a GPO Error in the Event Logs of the server.\n\n    The processing of Group Policy failed. Windows attempted to read the file \\\\Company.com\\SysVol\\Company.com\\Policies\\{2F7615E7-AFF0-499D-B2C1-417C2E8B9965}\\gpt.ini from a domain controller and was not successful. Group Policy settings may not be applied until this event is resolved. This issue may be transient and could be caused by one or more of the following: \n    a) Name Resolution/Network Connectivity to the current domain controller. \n    b) File Replication Service Latency (a file created on another domain controller has not replicated to the current domain controller). \n    c) The Distributed File System (DFS) client has been disabled.    \n    \n    - System \n    \n      - Provider \n    \n       [ Name]  Microsoft-Windows-GroupPolicy \n       [ Guid]  {AEA1B4FA-97D1-45F2-A64C-4D69FFFD92C9} \n     \n       EventID 1058 \n     \n       Version 0 \n     \n       Level 2 \n     \n       Task 0 \n     \n       Opcode 1 \n     \n       Keywords 0x8000000000000000 \n     \n      - TimeCreated \n    \n       [ SystemTime]  2017-09-07T12:29:58.347851700Z \n     \n       EventRecordID 152085 \n     \n      - Correlation \n    \n       [ ActivityID]  {69EBEBFE-0DF5-4AD0-9AD7-758F2930563E} \n     \n      - Execution \n    \n       [ ProcessID]  832 \n       [ ThreadID]  1948 \n     \n       Channel System \n     \n       Computer SERVER.Company.com \n     \n      - Security \n    \n       [ UserID]  S-1-5-18 \n     \n    \n    - EventData \n    \n      SupportInfo1 4 \n      SupportInfo2 816 \n      ProcessingMode 0 \n      ProcessingTimeInMilliseconds 546 \n      ErrorCode 1326 \n      ErrorDescription Logon failure: unknown user name or bad password.  \n      DCName DC2.Company.Com \n      GPOCNName cn={2F7615E7-AFF0-499D-B2C1-417C2E8B9965},cn=policies,cn=system,DC=company,DC=com\n      FilePath \\\\company.com\\SysVol\\company.com\\Policies\\{2F7615E7-AFF0-499D-B2C1-417C2E8B9965}\\gpt.ini \n    \n\nThis is failing on a Computer policy which is weird that it would lock out a user object.

There's the office part of the business with no cameras and the store/warehouse part where cameras are installed, sometimes behind the employees desks so he (they) can view whats going on on their employees screens. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nMy boss watches the cameras everyday. I'm the IT guy so they asked me to do the install. I have access to the logs and I can see who is connected and the time he has been logged in. At first, he was logging in every day or so but since the last few months, he started logging in everyday and spend all day stalking on his employees. He rearranged his office so we cannot see whats going on on his monitor (glass walls) but all the time I can see the reflexion of the cameras viewer on one of his office \"wall\"! I did some tests. If I go to the warehouse or store and have a quick chat for a few minutes with a store employee, he comes down and tells us to stop talking. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nLast week, he told me that I need to install hidden microphones in the ceiling but nobody can know. Alright, did it. But I told everyone that he asked me to install microphones and I told them the exact location of all of them. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nSome company owners are voyeurs. They have issues. They want to see everything. They want to hear everything. But my boss (and his son) are completely crazy. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nThey have Google alerts setup for each employee. So for example if I post something on craiglist using my real name, they get a google alert saying that I posted that. I know because one of these alerts (WITH MY NAME!) was stuck in the quarantine.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThey read the entire internal chat log on a daily basis. Tried to break the admin console to see if they would react: in less than 10 minutes they asked me if there was a problem with the chat monitoring console. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nNobody got a raise this year. They said nobody will have because business is struggling this year. When I was setting up the microphones, it recorded them saying the accountant that 4 or 5 employees will have a salary raise but nobody must know. I kept it to myself until one of the employee that got a raise left the company and told others that they raised his salary.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThey met us yesterday. We cannot talk while working. People in the warehouse cannot talk to each other except if this is work related. Same thing with store and office employees.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFinally, the boss son (the future owner - not a tech guy) asked me to forward every tech-related alerts to his email. So whenever he receives an alert from a printer, a backup notification, a server alert, he comes up to me and ask for details about the \"incident\". He wants to know why the printer had an alert and wants me to explain to him what I'll do to solve the issue. Even if its a paper jam or a low toner alert. He also wants to be CC'd to every emails employees send to anyone. This is micromanagement at its best.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis is completely crazy. As a sysadmin/only IT guy in the place, I won't let them spy on others like that. Been there for 3 years and this is getting crazy. Must leave ASAP\n\n",

My task is to get those logs to a remote server (preferbly using NXLog), but it appears that this is not as trivial as I would have hoped. I am however failry new to Analytic logging in windows and hence I might have missed an easy way to do it.\nI found an article from Microsoft describing how to enable (https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn800669(v=ws.11).aspx) this kind of logging and another article describing the use of this in network forensics (https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/teamdhcp/2015/11/23/network-forensics-with-windows-dns-analytical-logging/). I am however unable to read the logs unless I disable the analytic source if I am using log rotation. If I however enable no overwriting of the log, and drop once its full, I can read the log but I cannot clear it unless I restart the analytic source.\nI understand it is an option to send this Analytic log to an Operational destination, but I have been unable to figure out how to do that. Is that possible? I am aware that ther emight performance degradation, once I reach above 100k QPS on the DNS server.\nSo sum it all up, what i want to achive is the same as in the network forensic article linked above, one way or another. My current \"solution\" consists of a script stopping the source, dumping hte logs to a csv file, then starting the source again and hence I am able to get the data. I hope however there are a more streamlined solution. Any pointers of links to articles helping me to achive the above is appreciated.",

Having little virtual experience with Hyper-V and ESXi, do you think it's going to be a steep learning curve?

We have it on 100% of our systems and it makes it really easy to manage everything. We only use Windows at my company.\n\nIt doesn't take years of time and tens of thousands of dollars wasted on computer science college classes. We can learn it quickly, and we can easily find people who know how it works and can manage it.\n\nWhile other people are trying to write code on Linux and talk about it, we already have our Windows server up and running.\n\nEvery kind of software you can imagine runs on Windows even in really obscure industries. \n\nAll the normal certs teach you about Windows stuff, and there are a lot of jobs. Normal companies like mine use Windows for everything and it's the most common thing and the best way to get a job if you learn it. If you learn something more obscure normal companies won't even hire you. \n\nMicrosoft is also an example of the American dream where Bill Gates started with nothing and came up with products so good he's a billionaire. This is exactly the kind of company I think we should all support. \n\nOne thing I've learned lately is you have to stand up against elitists who give bad advice and make things too complicated.

The one problem I discovered is that our local HP printers were getting re-installed during the upgrade, thus changing the HP Universal Driver PCL 5 that was installed to the actual driver, I.E. HP LaserJet Pro M402n.\n\nThis probably wouldn't be an issue in most environments, but our main application is very picky about printer drivers, thus why we've stuck with the HP Universal.

The problem is that I can't find a solution so I'm coming here for a bit of a hand.\n\nThe situation is as follows:\nI have a few separate networks that I administer. I gain access to the networks using an RDG in each network. \nThe RDGs are all WS2012 R2.\nThe workstations that we use to access these environments are Windows 10 1703.\n\nI was using Windows 10 just fine until the creators update broke the ability to use MSTSC with an RDG. Which is why I switched to a Win7 VM that I run on my workstation while I waited for MS to fix the MSTSC issue.  Well, it's been a few months now and it seems that MS did fix the issue for Win 10 with an update, but then broke it again with another update. No major issue for me since I can just use my Win7 VM. But I am getting sick of using my VM to access these things and my colleagues have simply stopped installing Windows Updates due to fear of MSTSC breaking. \n\nThe error message I get from Win10 is: \"The logon attempt failed\"\n\n\nIf I use the Microsoft Remote Desktop App in Win10, I can connect. But that thing is rubbish for a number of servers/environments I need to admin. \n\nPreferably I'd like to use Win 10, MSTSC to connect through my RDG's and I'd like to know if anyone has had this problem and how they've fixed it?

If it does, you get a black console window... at which point you have to exit telnet right?  And this is where the bug comes in.\n\nYou press \\^], get the Microsoft Telnet> prompt, and type quit, right?  Sometimes it works and you get kicked back to your C: prompt... sometimes it doesn't, and you're left with:  \n\n    Welcome to Microsoft Telnet Client  \n  \n    Escape Character is 'CTRL+]'  \n\nWith no option but to close the Cmd prompt.  \n\nAm I the only one with this problem?  Am I incredibly stupid and/or overlooking the obvious?  Please tell me I'm not crazy here.  \n\nEdit: formatting\n\nEdit2: obviously I tried pressing \\^H a 2nd time. \n\nEdit3: please stop suggesting that I use things that aren't telnet.  I have thousands of servers with bone-stock Windows.  I'm not going to take the time to install/copy a different utility each time just to avoid this minor annoyance (in fact I usually just use a powershell one-liner instead), I just was curious if I was the only one with this problem...  as hard as it is to believe, apparently I am.",

It has a big front-end GUI with bright buttons and room for descriptions. Does an equivalent to this exist for Windows clients?\n\nWe currently use MDT for W7/10 deployment-time installs (which works great) and the free PDQDeploy with batch scripts, which largely uses the same files and also works great; but every now and then there's a few users who decide they just need Quickbooks or WinSCP that day on a system that previously never had it installed, so while the installation process for this case is unattended and only a single button push away, it still has to be fired off by an administrator. If possible I'd like to be able to tell users just to click the shiny \"Install Quickbooks\" button in the curated catalog and wait 2 minutes, rather than broadsiding every single desktop with every possible application a user could want.\n\nThis can probably be scripted to some extent, but I haven't found anything in the way of a prebuilt solution for it yet.

            "selftext": "WIP: I'm sure I accidental triggered some reddit formatting on first posting. \n\n\nTL;DR at bottom, there's a lot of rubber duck troubleshooting here. \n\nI have a small personal site I run on an ec2.nano instance, It's bare bones, no scripts, and just has all of my personal work with the files generated via Ansible playbooks. I've never had anything internet facing but with how simple things are I'm not super worried about security (or should I be?). I don't have much security experience in this context. But aws security groups make this stupid easy.\n\nAnyway, First week I parsed through my apache logs and saw I'm getting slammed every 10 minutes with a vulnerability scanner from different IPs: \n\n    x.x.x.x - - [05/Sep/2017:06:27:00 +0000] \"HEAD http://x.x.x.x:80/mysql/dbadmin/ HTTP/1.1\" 404 288 \"-\" \"Mozilla/5.0 Jorgee\"\n    x.x.x.x - - [05/Sep/2017:06:27:00 +0000] \"HEAD http://x.x.x.x:80/mysql/sqlmanager/ HTTP/1.1\" 404 288 \"-\" \"Mozilla/5.0 Jorgee\"\n    x.x.x.x - - [05/Sep/2017:06:27:01 +0000] \"HEAD http://x.x.x.x:80/mysql/mysqlmanager/ HTTP/1.1\" 404 288 \"-\" \"Mozilla/5.0 Jorgee\"\n \nI set up fail2ban to the best of my knowledge I think: Purpose of this thread: **some filters are working but I'm getting some weird behaviours and I'm not sure where to look to resolve it - I feel like every hit I get for configuring fail2ban is some blogpost from 2013-14, and their documentation is nothing but older third party references**\n\nI know I can configure apache to just ignore the user agent \"Jorgee\" but that is boring. I saw I can configure F2B to email me with whois's of the domains of the offending IPs and I thought it'd be fun to compile lists and play with the data.\n\nSo, I enabled the bot filters, but saw they had nothing for the Jorgee agent (Jorgee is a well known web scanner). I figured the filter I needed to edit was `apache-badbots.conf`\n\nSo, here's the filter, which looks for bad user agents:\n\n    [Definition]\n    \n    badbotscustom = EmailCollector|WebEMailExtrac|TrackBack/1\\.02|sogou music spider|**Mozilla/5.0 \\Jorgee**\n    badbots = Atomic_Email_Hunter [etc...] Wells Search II|WEP Search 00\n    \n    failregex = ^<HOST> -.*\"(GET|POST|HEAD).*HTTP.*\"(?:%(badbots)s|%(badbotscustom)s)\"$\n\n\nThis worked. Cool, but this isn't useful - How can I pick up a host trying to access like 50 default admin pages in a minute, regardless of user agent - I mean this is possible right? \n\nAnyway. Other issue I had was getting email to work, I'm  a bit rusty on Postfix since the only time I've set it up is a redhat exam I took awhile back and all I really want is a no-reply notifications sent to my personal gmail account so feel free to give some pointers. I just apt'd it and ran the internet installer that comes with it, swapped out some variables in main.cf, made firewall rule, added port 25 outgoing to my security group, and added the variables and it works, I guess. It shows up in my inbox as from root@mydomain and a lot of shit is getting marked as spam, but I can probably just hack in some filters to ignore that. Only concern is that it says it's from root. That doesn't imply I set something up insecurely right? I guess it's just because the fail2ban service is ran as root it does that?\n\nAnyway, I'm getting flooded with jail stopped-started messages but it's kind of weird. I don't see anything concerning in my fail2ban logfiles, but I don't get why I'm getting these emails? ie: \n\n    subject: [Fail2Ban] apache-auth: stopped on mydomain \n    Hi,\n    \n    The jail apache-auth has been stopped.\n    \n    Regards, \n    \n    Fail2Ban\n\nShould this be of concern? The only thing I get hits for are people disabling these emails but, I'm kind of curious as to why I'm getting them in the first place.\n\n\nAnyway, **TL;DR:** Making personal site of all my old projects and art, basic barebones apache on an ec2 instance. Getting slammed by vulnerability scanners. Want to find an effective and fun way of banning and recording the offending hosts. Also looking for general advice on internet facing nodes.. although aws makes that kinda trivial it seems.",

I was getting excited about security onion, until I looked at the requirements. I basically have to leverage old hardware that we have lying around, which means at best; an older i5 processor, 1TB max of storage, and a maximum of 16GB of RAM.  It sounds like the majority of the storage requirements come from logged packet captures. I can see the value in that, but there's no way I'll ever have the storage for it. Is it still viable to run security onion on an older server with limited disk space and memory, and just turn off the retention of packets?\n\nOriginally I was looking at Snort, as a package for PFSense, but I don't think the hardware on that firewall box is anywhere near enough, and security onion seems to be recommended instead of running a straight up Snort implementation anyways.

The better (longer) a user's password, the farther out the expiration date would be pushed, up to a maximum period (say 180 days).\n\nIn addition I would like the complexity requirements to be reduced as the password length increases. So an either character password will require at least one of each upper case, lower case, number and symbol, but a 64 character password could be entirely lower case. \n\nRequiring some significant level of change between the current and new password would be even better.

Among the many things that barrier needs to include is some very basic ( OWASP top ten style ignoring any opinions on OWASP ) tests, that act as a sort of baseline minimum bar. Specifically I am interested in web applications and REST APIs in this scenario.\n\nWe use Jenkins internally but use travis-ci for open source stuff. I am interested in both enterprise solutions ( for jenkins ) and open source / free solutions for the Open Source release side.\nNessus is kind of lackluster in it's capabilities as is qualys. BDD-Security looks pretty interesting, though. What I'd like, is to be able to walk an app in selenium, or specify an API structure using swagger files. Then, have the testing framework fuzz the application quickly in a PR test, and maybe more exhaustively in a release pipeline QA test. I am thinking of Appscan style testing... but ran from CI/CD with a config file specifying what findings to ignore or set as WARNs versus FAILs.\n\nI assume folks here have engaged in these sorts of 'devsecops' scenarios before. I was hoping someone could shoot me in the right direction, or add some great tools to my list to evaluate as I begin this journey. I'd be glad to post back some information when I settle on a solution and build it.\n\nThanks all!",

Thought maybe I didn't even need a failure since I'm fixing the entire reason for one. \n\nNope, the connection dropped - thought no big deal it should failover as I tested it and of course it didn't seem to register this and it didn't fail over. All without service. Everyone panicking. It came back up after 15 minutes on the comcast line with 0 intervention on my part.\n\nI'm looking at all the logs on my Sonicwall trying to gain insights on what's going on but nothing seems to be helping. I'd be more than happy to post a screenshot of these logs at the time frame of the loss of service.\n\nI've been scratching my head and trying to figure out what it could possibly be now.

As you can probably guess, \"the IT on the side\" is turning out to be much more than just \"something to handle on the side\" :) Figures, if it's been \"something on the side\" for quite some time.\n\nThe thing is: I'm a bit shy and I have hard time communicating my ideas convincingly. Also, I'm not very experienced. I know a lot of stuff, but I'm cursed with the ability of mostly learn by doing, so first times of anything are always scary and insecure if all I know is some theory I think I might remember right. Still, I'm not very hands-on guy.\n\nAlso, I sort of feel like I'm still in the old IT guy's shadow and should check with him before making any sort of changes. He's very knowledgeable, but feel sort of 'meh' towards anything I bring forth. The environment is quite ok. It could certainly do with a bit of tweaking here and hardening there. I think it's that way mostly because no one has really had the time to make it better. It's mostly Windows environment with some stuff running on Linux.

Secure boot is also enabled, and the OS has been installed by the UEFI-compatible media. I have also tried without secure boot and I have the same issue.  The OS is Windows 10 Pro, build 1703.\n\nWhen I open tpm.msc, the status of the device is [\"The TPM is ready to use.\"](https://i.imgur.com/fNPzbCF.png)\n\nI have a script to run to enable bitlocker:  \n     powershell.exe -executionpolicy bypass manage-bde -on c: -recoverypassword -recoverykey \\\\Officedc06\\path\\to\\folder\\BitLockerBackups.\n\nI have tried this as local admin, user, domain admin, etc. Also tried with the machine not joined to the domain to no avail.\n\nAccording to the results [this appeared to work fine](http://i.imgur.com/0wn7iJ9.png). A get-tpm command show [the TPM is present and ready](http://i.imgur.com/lt3IkBT.png). The machine is ready but after it is restarted I get an error message saying \"Bitlocker Could not be enabled. The BitLocker Encryption Key cannot be obtained. Verify the TPM is enabled and ownership has been taken. If this computer does not have a TPM, verify that the USB drive is inserted and avalible. C: was not encrypted.\n\nI've tried this on different machine models. Tried going back in, disabling the Bitlocker, re-enabling it, no luck. I've gone into Control Panel > Bitlocker and enabled it using a USB key okay. It's weird because this method has worked fine before - enable and clear TPM, prepare from tpm.msc and run script. But it's not working now. Can anyone point me where I'm going wrong?",

I know, I know, 'McAfee is the devil', 'I can never uninstall the stupid thing', etc.  It's worked for us; provided the base level of protection for my users, easy to manage, not a huge hit on performance, let's move on.\n\nThe issue came recently when, due to the way ePO updates software, I was having some issues getting Virus Scan Enterprise (VSE) installed on a system.  It turns out I had mismatched versions of ePO server, agent and VSE.  I contacted McAfee customer support and boy did I regret that decision.\n\nAfter 3 days of playing phone/email tag (mostly waiting on the rep), we finally got connected.  And frankly, I could only understand 2 out of every 5 words he said. Outsourced to India/Middle East, the reps accent was so thick, I genuinely couldn't hold a conversation of any value with him.  After a painful hour and a half of support that distilled down to 'you need to upgrade everything', we disconnected, ticket closed.\n\nI was emailed the default survey after the ticket closed, filled it out (voicing my concerns with the language barrier), and got a call back! From guess who? His manager; better english, but still far from his first language.\n\nI don't care from whence you hail, or what your native tongue is.  But when a language barrier gets in the way of doing business, it's something I simply don't have the time to afford.\n\n**The Question**\n\nDoes anybody know if one can purchase upgraded support for 'McAfee Endpoint Protection for SMB'?  Specifically that will provide US-based representatives? Do you have any experiences (good or bad) with this support?\n\n**The Funny**\n\nMy CFO sent me [this](https://i.imgur.com/EsK89Gq.png) over the weekend saying, \"Have fun with McAfee tech support\".

Which leads to this output: \n\n\npci-0000:82:00.0-sas-exp0x5003048001720bff-phy10-lun-0 -> ../../sdaf\n\npci-0000:82:00.0-sas-0x5003048001720bca-lun-0 -> ../../sdaf\n\n\n\nSame applies for WWNs: \n\nata-Hitachi_HDS724040ALE640_PK1311PAG3ZEDS\n\nwwn-0x5000cca22bc1cf5a\n\n\nSo if I use the PCI Path to build the Pool, will it only use the single path and not do any load balancing between the SAS ports?\n\nIf anybody knows how to set this up, I'd be happy to hear some suggestions.\n\nPeace \nJo",

With any version above 6, supposedly, you need to license **your entire virtual infrastructure**, so any clusters that run hosts above ESX version 5.1 in any vCenter in your environment. The only way around that seems to be an Oracle approval of a seperate part of your infrastructure, with seperate LUNs only for Oracle and a seperate VLAN which has to be configured outside of VMware on switches.\n\nAnd even if I stayed on vSphere 5.5 I'd have to split off one cluster into a seperate vCenter instance but that's nothing to go on with for the foreseeable future and I want to avoid this.\n\nThe only real way to get away from it is to \"simply\" switch to MS SQL.\n\nOtherwise I'm considering to build a seperate cluster with 4 new servers and an own vCenter, with exclusive LUNs and networking and then try to get this part of my infrastructure approved by Oracle to only pay for these 4 servers.\n\nEnglish is not my native language, so please excuse any errors.",

One easy job to give an apprentice is to do some work on the patch panels. This one was quite special, because it involved fiber connections. When the apprentice got really excited about not having to work with copper, but with fiber instead, I told him he had to switch off all the fluorescent lamps when working with fiber. The direct ilumination could cause some interference in the fiber.   \nA few hours later I go to check on him, as this task was taking more time than normally needed.  \nAs I walk into the hallway in which all our server closets are located, I notice all the lights turned off. It's in the basement so there is absolutely no lights coming in from the outside.  \nI hear some weird noises, a mix of shouting and cursing, coming out of one of the closets. I open the door and there is the apprentince sitting in complete darkness trying to arrange the cabling on the patch panel.   \nThe moment I switched on the lights, he curses at me to switch them off again.   \nI burst into laughter and he realizes what he was doing.   \n&nbsp;\n\n*The best way to learn is to take everything with a grain of salt and sarcasm.*",

            "selftext": "I'm not really sure what subreddit to post this on so will try random places see what I get.  We're an IT company but we're starting to resell some Internet circuits to our customers that prefer having 1 provider invoice them for everything and to manage all their sites.  So what I'm looking for, is basically provisioning and billing software but I'm having a really hard time finding anything that either meets all our needs, or that isn't insanely expensive.  We use Salesforce today on Professional edition, but here's what I'm trying to find:\n\n- I need recurring billing with a portal.  So if the customer installs an internet circuit August 28th, our billing period is the 16th to the 15th, so they would have a pro-rated charge for August 28th to September 15, and then September 16 to August 15.  I have found a few providers that do this, like Sonar, Chargebee, Recurly, etc but they all don't really meet every need we have.  Sonar seems good for this type of billing though.\n- I need a billing system like the above but with a portal users can log into to view invoices and pay them.  If they have 200 circuits, they need to get ONE invoice monthly that includes ALL 200 circuits, not 200 invoices.\n- I need a way to track the orders, and the circuits they have WITH a customer portal.  This is mainly where I'm stuck.  In Salesforce, I made a custom module called \"Circuit Order\" and then \"Circuits\" linked to an Account.  The Circuits tracks things like provider, download speed, upload speed etc.  The Circuit Order module tracks when we have an order in, like to install a new one or move it and so on.  I need a way for customers to view this online also, so list all their circuits, view all their orders and so on.\n\nI'm finding lots of billing systems like the ones mentioned above, but none are any good at provisioning like this.  Some support provisioning, but actual telco provisioning, where our \"provisioning\" is us ordering a circuit from our wholesale provider.  The other problem with these billing systems is that they are so basic for this.  Like none seem to go by address, so you could have 200 circuits but they all just list the product name 200 times.  Some do custom fields but it's clunky.\n\nWhat I'm really looking for is a system that can track internet circuit orders, track the circuits, handle invoicing and billing, and provide a portal to the customer to view all the above.  Microsoft Dynamics 365 seemed like it could work with the customer portal, but I'd still need a billing system.  Salesforce I thought getting Enterprise edition would work but now it doesn't look like it includes a portal either.\n\nHoping for some suggestions or even if there's a name or term commonly used for this type of system, as I'm having trouble looking for something that I don't know how to describe!

Just remember, always always always check the simple stuff.\n\nGot a new computer, a Surface Pro, using a USB NIC to connect to network and join it to the domain. Got an error message \"Unable to join domain, Remote Procedure Call failed.\" This was a new one for me, did some Googling, didn't see anything near the top. Figured, well that wouldn't be the first time I got a computer with pre-installed Windows borked up on it.\n\nSo since PXE doesn't work with non-Microsoft USB NICs I plugged it into dock and re-imaged. It joined domain, no problem and installed a bunch of software. \n\nFast-forward to today, I pull it off dock and go back to USB NIC. Try to login, trust relationship broken. Weird, I take it off domain then try to rejoin, bam, RPC error again.\n\nMore Google and digging deeper see people indicating the issue lies with the server. Nevermind that I successfully joined another machine that same day without error. So I restart the domain controller, amazingly enough it then joins the domain. Awesome problem solved...nope.\n\nI notice it never pulled down group policy, try gpupdate, it fails indicating it can't read the group policy from sysvol. Open Explorer and confirm I can get to it from that same machine...what the heck. \n\nAt this point I'm envisioning rebuilding my domain controller and step away to plan this. Then it hits me, what if this is a NIC issue. I try disconnecting and rejoining domain over wireless, works perfectly and pulls group policy down without issue.\n\nThat stinking USB NIC found its way to the garbage!

It is a very small network, and apparently no one ever set them up with a redundant DC. They want to get rid of the 2003 DC altogether, so no option to keep it.\n\nLast week I migrated DHCP, DNS, and all AD schemas and FSMO roles. I have the 2003 DC running as active, but secondary DC with the 2016 DC as primary.\n\nDHCP has been entirely removed from 2003 DC and now only runs on 2016 DC.\n\nIs it safe to reboot the 2016 DC even once I demote and unplug the 2003 DC? (I understand that since DHCP server is down, so no new hosts can log in while the server is down - this is fine).\n\nI need to reboot because - they also have their DC hosting their shared folders. So I need to robocopy them over to the new DC. I'm hoping to just do a Lanman registry CNAME alias - but in case I need to change the IP and name of the DC so that they can keep referencing in their client hosts as they used to do with the 2003 DC.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nEDIT:\nAdditional info on the CNAME thing:\n\nWhat happens now is the they use this '\\\\\\oldDCname' to access the share. When I set up the new DC, naturally I had to do it with a different name and IP as the old DC. But, what they want to do is be able to have the shares in the new DC but still access them through '\\\\\\oldDCname' - so to speak.",

Rather than try to write our own I figured there must be something out there but I'm not finding anything that will do the job the way I want, or do the job without breaking the bank.\n\nBasically I just want to be able to charge for ram and cpu (total ram and # of cpus assigned) while the vm is on and for the amount of use disk space consumed regardless of power state. I would also need to integrate any data from what program with our by either pushing my management data to it or pulling the data out and then merging with mine.\n\nI've looked at a few options but haven't found anything yet and I'm sure there's a bunch I haven't found on my own so please, if you have any ideas, just toss them out there so I can go and investigate.\n\nThanks",

We're setting up a new load balancer VIP on an encrypted service and the health monitor isn't working.  Everything looks fine from what I can see, but I can't figure out why it is failing.  I do a packet capture and can see that they're speaking, but not sure what is being sent.\n\nI am adding the private key to Wireshark and it complains.  I had an RSA key in PEM format originally and it complains about loading the key \"Can't load private key from z:\\server.key\".  The debug log says:\n\n> ssl_load_key: can't import pem data: ASN1 parser: Error in DER parsing.\n\nOk, so it wants a key in DER format.  I convert to DER with this command:\n\n    openssl rsa -in server.key -out ~jlupo/server.key.der -outform der\n\nNow, I try to use that key and I get the same error, but this time the debug says:\n\n> ssl_load_key: can't import pem data: The requested data were not available.\n\nWTF?  Of course you'll have trouble parsing DER data in a PEM file and of course you can't import PEM data from a DER file.  The key has no password.  I've verified that already.  I've also even tried sticking the public cert into the file to make a combined pub/private key both in PEM and DER formats.  No go.\n\nHas anyone done this successfully?",

I haven't tested other ssh clients.\n\nFull example command I use: `ssh -v -R :0:localhost:31337 theblazehen.com -p 8022 -N`\n\nThis appears to work correctly, and I get the expected `Allocated port 39782 for remote forward to localhost:31337`, however it only actually works with older ssh clients.\n\nExample of it working correctly when I make a connection with `OpenSSH_5.3p1, OpenSSL 1.0.1e-fips 11 Feb 2013`\n    \n    debug1: client_input_channel_open: ctype forwarded-tcpip rchan 0 win 2097152 max 32768\n    debug1: client_request_forwarded_tcpip: listen  port 0, originator ::1 port 59858\n    debug1: connect_next: host localhost ([127.0.0.1]:31337) in progress, fd=4\n    debug1: channel 0: new [::1]\n    debug1: confirm forwarded-tcpip\n    debug1: channel 0: connected to localhost port 31337\n\nHowever when using a newer openssh client (`OpenSSH_6.6.1p1, OpenSSL 1.0.1e-fips 11 Feb 2013`)\n\n    debug1: client_input_channel_open: ctype forwarded-tcpip rchan 0 win 2097152 max 32768\n    debug1: client_request_forwarded_tcpip: listen  port 0, originator 35.189.197.151 port 47072\n    WARNING: Server requests forwarding for unknown listen_port 0\n\nAnd the connection is then obviously not made. \n\nFull ssh server that I use (not using the standard openssh server):\n\n    import asyncio, asyncssh, sys\n    from pprint import pprint\n    \n    def handle_client(process):\n        process.stdout.write(\"handling client\")\n        process.exit(0)\n    \n    class MySSHServer(asyncssh.SSHServer):\n    \n        def kbdint_auth_supported(self):\n            return True\n    \n        def get_kbdint_challenge(self, username, lang, submethods):\n            print(\"got conn\")\n            return True\n    \n        def server_requested(self, listen_host, listen_port):\n            return True\n    \n        def begin_auth(self, username):\n            return True\n    \n    async def start_server():\n        await asyncssh.create_server(MySSHServer, '', 8022,\n                                     server_host_keys=['ssh_host_key'],\n                                     process_factory=handle_client)\n    \n    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()\n    \n    try:\n        loop.run_until_complete(start_server())\n    except (OSError, asyncssh.Error) as e:\n        print(e)\n    \n    loop.run_forever()\n\n\nGoogle brought me to https://groups.google.com/d/msg/opensshunixdev/tFdpDBcfjLI/ZLZYD2ykx6YJ however that appears to only apply to when you're running multiple dynamically allocated remote port forwards. I'm not sure if the patch at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/opensshunixdev/tFdpDBcfjLI was merged at some time, but `Here's a proposed patch against version 6.2p2` which is after the working openssh client version and before the non-working openssh client version suggests that it could be at fault. \n\nWould appreciate any advice",

We have abilities such as being admins to web servers, file servers, granting local admin access to computers, adding computers to the company's domain...etc.  We work with our headquarters IT/security departments in Seattle to get the type of access that we have, and that access is never given out lightly.  We are an IT team but we are basically guests to the system with very high security privileges compared to a regular company user.  \n\nOne chronic problem that we have had is with a certain IT support employee and how they work, specifically regarding the security side of their job.  Many times the employee has been caught using and sharing others passwords to add computers to our domain (before we had permissions), sharing their passwords with multiple locations so they can join all of their out-of-compliance machines to the network, granting out-of-compliance machines to the network...etc.  The main theme is that whatever is the quickest route, disregarding any company policies or security policies, that route will be taken.  This is even more concerning as of lately due to the viruses like PetYa and WannaCry.  Many machines have been re-granted network access even though those machines were taken off by the headquarters' security team for not having the specific patches for those viruses.  The headquarters location has been changing their policies to tighten security and prevent issues with those and future vulnerabilities.  \n\nThe concerning thing is that when security measures and policies are blatantly disregarded, this puts the whole company/network at risk. This has been locally reported many, many times before but no one (even management) wants to bring it to the attention of our headquarters.  This has been going on for more than two years.  \n\nMy question is: What is the best way to report such chronic security vulnerabilities to a security group with the lease amount of blow-back toward the person doing the reporting?  I am trying to keep myself out of this as much as possible since the person being reported is someone I work with every day but I realize I can\u2019t stay 100% anonymous if I report this to the security admins.  I have an interesting week coming up.  Thank you!",

I have tried the usual methods of executing remote commands via psexec and PSSession but psexec doesn't work because of how our Active Directory and network is set up, and PSSession doesn't work because the tool I need to run requires the program I run work on a graphical user session. Our machines all have VNC installed, so I was wondering if there was any tools that let you use a VNC session to execute remote commands. I found one tool that seems to do exactly what I want, vncdotool, however the documentation is pretty out of date it seems and I can't get it to actually work because I can't get all the dependencies to install correctly. Are there any CLI VNC tools or other tools that will let me execute remote commands on a graphical interface?",

It was him, 4 other IT colleagues and myself setting up and configuring his new log indexer and agents.  During that time, he added a few new DNS entries on his DNS server and immediately had his guys update the host files on the critical systems where the logging agent was going as well as his new log indexer cluster.  \n\nHe quickly quipped to his guys about \"the last guy who didn't update the host file...\" \n\nDuring the meeting, there was a slow part where we were waiting for his Host file update scripts to run and update several hundred host files.  There was some awkward silence, so I asked him about \"the last guy\"...\n\nTurns out there was not just one guy who got fired for not updating the host file, but 4 others over the last several years.  \n\nEach time DNS fucked up or something broke that cut off access to DNS or expired DNS cache, a certain key system would go down and cause mass panic and huge business losses.  Those guys didn't update the Host file accordingly or at all.  The host file was critical for keeping those systems working during the outage, he claims.  \n\nHe showed me his very detailed documentation on policy and procedures and configurations for all his key systems.  \n\n> I take change and config management **very** seriously.\n\nAt the end of the day, I configured his Log management system to monitor and report on all his CI's that he needed, including all Host files.  There was several hundred hosts going in and he needed a better way of monitoring and managing all the logs and do his own ad-hoc audits.  He had one of his guys write a bash and PS script to scrape all the host files, export to JSON and import it into his new Log Indexer.  This way, he knew who edited it, when and what changes here made.\n\nGoing back in time, I used to work for a MSP that had policies to add IPs and Hostnames in Host files for web and database servers.  I just assumed (I was young and very inexperienced back then) that is just how those systems were set up and was necessary.  I did not know, at the time, that that step was to help when (not \"if\") DNS troubles happened.\n\nHow do you guys use host files as a backup to DNS?",

            "selftext": "There's sort of an ongoing thing on /r/sysadmin where people tell each other that to \"become a sysadmin\" you need an A+, a CCNA, and no college. It's a constant back and forth argument and I don't really want to have that argument again. Instead I want to give context for why I'm sharing this project my group worked on to give people some alternate ideas when they're not exposed to environments like what I describe.\n\n---\n\nWe implemented a cloud based, SaaS solution to replace one of our legacy business systems. This took something like 6-8 months, and involved a lot of IT people with different skillsets as well as people on the business side.\n\nThis was all actual work done by IT employees:\n\n**Selection**\n\nMost of the discussion on here tends to start at implementation, but before you can install and set up product, you have to pick it.\n\nWe got a number of people together, both from IT and the business side to talk about features, and built a rubric. IT people contributed security requirements and requirements for integration with existing systems among many other things and people on the business side contributed requirements for specific functionality and workflows.\n\nThere was a lot of writing by all.\n\nOnce the rubric was created, a number of different vendors were invited to present their products, and both IT and business people scored the projects on the rubrics. This required deep technical understanding as well as understanding of the business side.\n\nUltimately the products were compared based on the scores as well as cost of the products, and one of them was chosen as the best compromise across everything\n\n**Implementation**\n\nThis was a SaaS product, but there was still quite a bit for IT staff to do.\n\n\u2022 Project Management included setting milestones and monitoring progress and figuring out what to do as changes needed to be made\n\n\u2022 The product had to integrate with existing, on-prem systems so someone had to write a fairly complex python script to take data out of one system, massage the data into another format, and then push it out to the SaaS provider. This ran in an on-prem Linux VM.\n\n\u2022 There was an LDAP connector that had to be installed and configured on an on-prem Windows VM to take data from AD and push it to the SaaS provider\n\n\u2022 We had to work with the SaaS provider to have their system talk to our SSO system for authentication\n\n\u2022 Most importantly, we had to have people within IT work with the business side to map out every one of their \nprocesses and rework it in the new system. This is the part that really took months. \n\n\u2022 The SaaS product had to be customized to include our look and feel and colors\n\n\u2022 Significant testing had to be performed by IT staff looking at different scenarios\n\n\u2022 Training materials had to be created by IT staff so classes could be set up as well as creating a manual for the help desk\n\nThe project ended up being a big success and was completed slightly ahead of schedule.\n\nA large number of different technical skills were used by different team members including scripting on both Linux and Windows, LDAP management, database skills, HTML/CSS skills, but also project management, the ability to do coherent and concise writing, business process mapping and the ability to make a coherent argument (this had to be done over and over again and quickly as changes would need to be communicated and justified and implemented).\n\nPeople on here like to say \"sysadmin is dead\" sometimes and fear SaaS products, but meanwhile this kept a large IT group very busy for the better part of a year and there's a lot more work coming after that. Even after this system was implemented there's going to be a lot of ongoing maintenance. The SaaS provider might be running the underlying server operating systems and responding to hardware outage pages at 3 am, but there's till a hell of a lot of stuff for our IT department to do.\n\nEveryone involved with the project had a BS or BA from a brick and mortar college. Nobody had any certs. I'm not sure that there really is a cert that would have covered any of this work. We had a couple of very recent college grads making excellent contributions (one was an MIS major, the other was an econ major with a CS minor - everyone else had 5-10 years experience). I don't think an A+/CCNA/no degree person could have helped in any real capacity with this work.\n\nThe core skills here were not building PCs, running cable, installing things in racks, worrying about processors and RAM and RAID, etc\n\nJust something to think about...",

Do they check to see if the connecting domain is present in the mailserver certificate? Or do they just check if the HELO or hostname matches the certificate? Or do they check for all the conditions, i.e. connecting hostname = SMTP HELO = Certificate Hostmane?

My understanding is several factors come into play, so here's what I'm working with.\n\n* Dell R730xd\n\n* 22x 1.8 TB 10K drives\n\nWhat I'm considering is either 7x 3-drive sets with a global hot spare in RAID 50, 4x 5-drive sets with 2 global hot spares, or one massive RAID 6. My thoughts are with the 7 sets, there's less potential for more than one drive in any particular set to fail, whereas the 4 sets would provide less parity overhead. Obviously with these being backups storage, read speeds are less a concern than write speeds, however storage capacity demands simply don't allow for a RAID 10. \n\nSuggestions?

I want to set up something new.\n\nThe company I work at grew rapidly and still uses one Excel sheet to enter all notebooks that we use. Almost non-exist device history. No possibility to really track software licenses and their use. We have a huge mess with our vSphere licenses right now.\n\nBut what really, really grinds my gears is that we require an order by ticket to buy new equipment like screens. This has to be approved by the right superior of the according department, since he/she has to pay for it from their budget.\n\nHere's the catch: We absolutely have no way to track where the equipment has wandered off to.\n\nWe have Spicework already running somewhere on an old machine that nobody ever uses. \n\nDo you have any sort of inventory management / supply chain management tips for me? I really don't want to watch my company lose any more money to this.\n\nRequirements: \n\n* Should have an option to check the device history. Who was it assigned to? Why is it with Marketing since three months despite them just needing it for one event? \n\n* Maybe some sort of tracking, as sometimes people (me) forget to enter the names of the people that devices get assigned to.\n\n* A way to properly assign a device to a department.\n\n* A way to manage software licences.

            "selftext": "Hey everyone, I'll tell you my story, but I want to know how you decided on a career path in IT. Whether it's Network Admin, Security, Operations, DBA, etc.\n\nI'm 29, and moved into higher ed. IT in September 2016. Prior to that I was working small jobs in unrelated fields while pursuing music management. As with most musicians the dreams of life on the road finally ended when I didn't see a way to start a family on the money I was earning (and losing $14,000 at the tables in Vegas during a bachelor party doesn't help). So I decided to go back to my passion as a teenager and applied for a Help Desk Tech Level 1 position at the school I was a security supervisor at (insert Paul Blart joke since my name is Paul). \n\nI was surprisingly accepted and the University pay is garbage although the benefits are outstanding. Recently my boss left for another school and I was told to apply for the Help Desk Manager job. I'm not going to toot my own horn, I'm a humble guy, but I've learned what my job encompasses and more in only eleven months while getting my A+ and I'll be taking my ACMT and Lenovo servicing certifications in the next two weeks or so and hopefully my Network+ by the end of the year and SCCM classes after that.\n\nI was working in a closet with our Network Admin recently and he asked me what my end goal is and I couldn't really answer it. \n\nI like dealing with people (we have a pretty laid back group of faculty/staff/students where I work), but I also like networking (although I only know the very basics), security (this was what I was studying at ITT Tech before I withdrew in 2010), but I also like server management.\n\nIs there like a catch-all position in IT to shoot for? I like being a jack of all trades although I know the saying \"if a cat chases two mice it loses both of them\" so I'm trying to think of what to do after (or even if I don't) get the management job.\n\nEDIT: This blew up a lot more than I expected it to and I sincerely appreciate all of the responses so far, but I probably won't be able to reply to every single one. If I condensed everyone's response into one sentence I think it would be \"Be ready to change, but continue being a jack of all trades while trying to master at least one thing.\" You all seem like good people, keep it up!",

I have a feeling this is simple with linux but how could I setup a ubuntu or similiar machine to take traffic as a gateway (10.0.0.10) and route it to another IP address (10.0.0.1). This would allow us to keep the iptables.

One of the hosts has a degraded hard drive in its RAID 10 array.  I\u2019m having trouble physically identifying which hard drive is the bad one.  The server is a custom built server (in production), and it seems the RAID controller doesn\u2019t have a network-enabled management web interface that I can access.  I know with iLo or DRAC I can easily have the drive identified physically, but this server is giving me no indication on the outside that there is a busted drive.  Booting into the RAID controller while the server is in POST doesn\u2019t help much either.\n\nThe RAID controller says Drive 4 in Span 2 is missing (https://imgur.com/a/cWq3B)\n\nBut when you look at the front of the server, all the drives seem fine in terms of their lights, except for the first drive to the left, but it doesn\u2019t make sense that, that would be Drive 4 in Span 2.

I guess he thinks it will be impossible to teach a small handful of users the new folder location.\n\nHe e-mailed me, saying, \"I don't understand why this is necessary.\"\n\nI replied with a brief summary explaining the risks and problems associated with the old method (leaving it in place and blocking inheritance).  He then responded again, still saying he didn't understand why things couldn't be done the old way.\n\nI then replied with a lengthier and more detailed explanation, complete with example scenarios of how things can go wrong his way, but he still wasn't interested.\n\nHowever, he refused to say, \"I understand what you are saying and still want to do it my way.\"  Instead, he just kept hitting me back with \"I'm confused\" or \"I don't understand\" or similar statements.\n\nI tried calling him with no answer or callback.  I e-mailed offering to schedule a call and he ignored the offer.\n\nSeveral days and a handful of emails later, I caved.  I got sick of explaining it to this guy who obviously DGAF about what I am saying and clearly isn't even reading it.  I just replied \"This is not my recommendation, but I have set things back the old way.\"\n\nIn retrospect I feel like maybe I should have continued to press him, maybe specifically asking which part he doesn't understand, and asking him to confirm that he understands the risks but still wants to do things his way.  Where it stands right now, I effectively threw a hissy fit and implemented a dangerous setup rather than explaining it to management who said they don't understand.  Not only did I give this guy what he wanted, but he has all the protection provided by playing dumb.\n\nThis is one of the parts of IT that I am terrible at: finding the balance of politics with doing things improperly.

There are a couple of recent exceptions:\n\nDue to a limitation in S3 where resolving a host name requires a bucket with a matching name, I am hosting my frontend code on beanstalk and still calling the backend code from Lambda. We have thousands of domains pointing to our beanstalk endpoint and around 50,000 hits a day using a handful of micro instances. Very affordable (almost free tier), no performance issues so far.\n\nDue to the price of Gateway API on an app that will quickly scale up to 15M hits per day, we again swapped in a beanstalk component using two c4.large instances which essentially handle the API call to Lambda. So far this looks like it will scale and we'll cut our cost on the API Gateway down from around $50 per day to $5 per day. Lambda is maybe $10 or less at scale.\n\nIn both cases we swap out a piece of our infrastructure for Beanstalk after the fact, begging the question, should we just do it all on Beanstalk at this point? Or does shipping most of the processing to Lambda still provide some benefit over EC2 nodes?",

They called us yesterday and said we have 30 days to shrink it, or we get charged $10,000/year to bump our license to 5GB. \n\n$10,000/year for 4GB of storage? I ask them why... \"Our storage is the best-in-class. The best encryption and the most durable in the market.\" I mean, I'm just storing 37TB in S3 for ~$800/month, but sure, 4GB of \"best in class\" must justify the cost. \n\nAnyway.

            "selftext": "Dear Mr. Scrubmortis:\n\nThank you for taking the time to share your thoughts about internet regulation. I appreciate hearing from you and welcome the opportunity to respond.\n\n\nAccording to industry metrics, private investment in the internet has exceeded $1.5 trillion dollars since 1996, leading to the creation of millions of jobs, economic prosperity, and a society where the accessibility of information is at a level unimaginable merely two or three decades ago.\n\n\nIn 2015, the Federal Communications Commission voted in secret to reclassify broadband internet access services as \u201ctelecommunication services\u201d under Title II of the Communications Act of 1934. This allowed the government to regulate the internet under the same rules designed for telephone companies in the 1930s, hampering innovation and growth in that industry for more than fifty years.\n\n\nThe FCC\u2019s 2015 edict requires Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to treat all data traveling over their networks equally, rather than allowing ISPs to customize service offerings with their users and compete for more customers on the basis of quality and price, even if those service offerings include treating some data differently. This essentially imposes a one-size-fits-all business model on the internet and represents an unprecedented government power grab to control and regulate the internet.\nI support Chairman Pai\u2019s desire to overturn the FCC\u2019s 2015 mandates, which clearly run contrary to Congressional intent, to better allow Congress to dictate appropriate oversight of the internet through new, thoughtful legislative initiatives.  In fact, I cosponsored S. 993, the Restoring Internet Freedom Act, which would scrap the FCC\u2019s ill-founded interpretation and net neutrality mandates.\n\n\nAgain, thank you for taking the time to contact me. Please do not hesitate to get in touch with me again about other issues that are important to you.\nSincerely,\n\nThom Tillis\nU.S. Senator\n\n---------------------------\n\nWhile I didn't expect to get a response back at all, this is pretty much what I expected I would get. Living in rural NC I can tell you I have 1 option, and it sucks. Does anyone have a non-expletive laden response they have had success with responding to their GOP senator? At this point our options seem few and far between.",

My initial thoughts are creating a small local network, and sabotaging the workstations and network.  Maybe a loop off a small switch (create a dhcp broadcast storm), unplugging the sata cable, things like that.  Any of you had experience with this? Is it even worth it for a basic IT position?

Great, inventorying everything, clumping through wet/muddy office to do so.\n* Client building out of commission for 4 weeks minimum. Awesome, building today allowed us ONE hour to go inside and grab whatever we could. No power in the building, no elevators, 17 flights of stairs it is, headlamps, cart, snag as much equipment as possible.\n* Client office ruined, has to have new laptops to work remotely... shipping to Houston is all delayed. Ok, let's ship them all to Austin and we'll drive up there and get them!\n* Client building out of commission. Another snag and grab up 22 flights of stairs, carrying down multiple storage units, servers, etc. At least it was a workout!\n* Client office under water, managed to save their equipment, have to set it their entire environment up at a new office though!\n* Yet another client office not opening back up for 4 weeks. Can't even get in. Luckily have basic off-site backup and we're building some brand new cloud servers and restoring their data to them.\n* Client had a cold DR site hosted with us... their office went down... our datacenter we had that cold site also went down.

            "selftext": "We had a major Active Directory outage here in my organization recently that we haven't been able to explain.  Hoping maybe someone here might be able to offer some input.  I was out-of-town on vacation when this occurred, so everything I know is based on second-hand information from my team.\n\nThe issue started when they were patching a group of servers including one of our domain controllers (we have 4 DCs in our domain) during our monthly maintenance window.  Patches were applied and at some point during the reboot cycle, they started experiencing major authentication related problems across the organization with SQL, Exchange, etc.\n\nA support call was placed to Microsoft and they were of no help.  All health and replication checks with Active Directory came back clean.  The patches that were installed were rolled back, but that didn't help either.\n\nEventually, the problem was narrowed down to an issue with NTLM authentication.  Anything using NTLM didn't work.  Everything that used Kerberos did.\n\nAfter much time struggling, they eventually tried building a new domain controller (fully patched) and as soon as they promoted it to a DC, everything started working again.  To further test, they powered off that new domain controller and things broke again so it was clearly the introduction of the new domain controller that fixed the problem.\n\nAt this point, we are replacing each of the old domain controllers one by one with newly built ones.  It was as if something got corrupted and the introduction of a new DC fixed it.\n\nAnyone ever seen anything like this or have any thoughts?\n\nP.S. I know Kerberos is best practice and we are already putting together plans to move what we can to using it.",

But if I'll ever have to deal with a compromised lan I don't think I will find great solace in that.\n\nI tried to bring the issue at the upper floors but they dismissed it as not-really-an-issue, and since moving all the web servers in DMZ would open the huge can of worms of rethinking more secure data transfers between internal production servers and web servers (right now it's done with nfs shares) I'm not really sure about how I want to insist on this.\n\nEdit: thanks a lot for all the great responses so far! To clarify, I'm absolutely NOT against reverse proxies and I already enjoyed all the benefits listed by u/cs_major and others, my main concern is the pool of the internal web servers accessed via the reverse proxy (that are in the internal lan with almost everything else).",

This allowed clients to actually initiate downloads of 1607 and 1703, but they fail with the same errors few minutes later during installation process.\n\nThe error I get when I try to install these WSUS updates are - \"Update is not applicable\".

Yes, I have configured .ESD stream-octet in apppool and yes, database is fixed and comes back with no errors.\n\nShould I try to delete all upgrades on master and all replicas and retry downloading them? This will disrupt updates in all offices though.\n\n**Also Problem 2:**\nWith 1703 update (which also came with database issues that I remember fixing), none of the clients automatically download updates anymore, we have to initiate them manually from each client (click \"Retry\"), often have to delete SoftwareDistribution folder for updates to work again.\n\nShould I just Reinstall OS+WSUS on all 4 servers?

            "selftext": "Hey folks, first time poster here\n\n\nCurrently I am facing the challenge to find a better inventory system for our infrastructure. Our old system is a management nightmare and eats up worker resources. Though it has a few nice functionalities, it has to go.\n\nNow I am on the hunt for a system/tool, that should do the following things:\n\n- User management - A list of every potential user that works at this place\n\n- Manage hardware inventory - Manually or with Scans, Manually should support having templates when creating new entries, includes Scanners, Printers, all that jazz\n\n- Manage software inventory - Best case would be with license management\n\n- Has a Barcode Scanner interface - With this you could scan tagged hardware (we tag everything) and then create an entry (with a template), alter one or flat out delete it if you want to trash the hardware\n\n- Talks with the AD to enable software and hardware deployment - This one is rather tricky. So let me use the next paragraph to describe a scenario:\n\nCurrently our tool has access to our printserver. With this you can take any configurated printer and assign it to a user or computer. Furthermore we have a secondary tool (which we wanna get rid of as well, its a resource hog) which then reads out the information about the linked stuff. It then connects the printer or network storage on login until logoff or shutdown. Of course this means if there is a dead printer in that list, you gotta have to wait for the timeout. \n\nThis is really the last nice functionality though, if it wasnt for the hefty management ammount. \n\nMost ideally we want to integrate software deployment with the new tool. Right now ours doesnt support that and we have to do wonky stuff with SCCM for example.\n\nSo far I have found a few tools that do a few things good but lack other stuff. For example quadriga does the inventory stuff well but lacks the deployment. \n\nDoes anyone know of such a tool or system? Thanks in advance\n\nEdit: Oh I totally forgot about the business aspect. Of course it would need a functionality to at least store sales contracts and probably merchant informations",

            "selftext": "The interviewer asked me how I would remotely troubleshoot a server that was not responding.  My first suggestion was ping, he said it's unresponsive.  I said I'd traceroute to see how close I could get to it, and if the last hop was a device I could access I'd log in and see if there were routing issues or ports down.  He said the traceroute makes it all the way to the server but it doesn't respond, and I don't have access to the penultimate device.  I said my next step would be DRAC or iLO, he said that's not responsive either.\n\nI said I've seen some cases where a server has multiple ethernet ports and not all are on the same subnet, so maybe I'd try one of the other subnets, he said that was unresponsive too.  I said my next step would be to send a field tech to try to log in locally, he said there's no monitor.  I suggested the field tech could try connecting to one of the ethernet ports directly from a laptop configured to be on the same subnet, he said no, the NIC is dead.\n\nAt this point I was really stumped and I said, \"Well, I guess it would depend on the make/model of the server.  If the NIC card is a hot swappable module you could swapping that, but if it's not then I don't know what else I could do short of rebooting it.  I mean I know you shouldn't reboot a server without doing it gracefully but that's all I've got left.\"\n\nHe said okay and we moved onto another question and I never did get a chance to come back and ask him if there were some steps I'd missed.  Can any of you think of anything I missed?\n\nEDIT: I suppose I could've asked if there were multiple physical connections ... if only one then swap the cable and/or reseat connectors.  But he flat out said the NIC was dead so at that point I was focused on how I would address the NIC being dead.",

            "selftext": "See edits below for updates!!! Up to six edits thus far.  To include the exact nature of the DNS resolver everone is asking about.\n\nSo I work for this company that is rather medium sized. I was hired three months ago. It is just myself, and one other Helpdesk guy. When I started, my compatriot told me that The Sysadmin had recently quit after not getting a raise he felt he was due, and it was just us two now.\n\nNow before I sing his praises too much, you need to understand that my co-worker worked with him for a year but knows next to nothing. He stated that The Sysadmin handled everything that came up short of printers. The Sysadmin never answered a ticket that was printer related even if the owners asked him to. Therefore my coworker is an idiot savant. Guy knows printers and NOTHING else. But damn he can swap a fuser in like 5 seconds. But he doesn't know where anything is, or how to access anything.\n\nI am straight out of the Geek Squad and know nothing either. I was just thrilled to have a \"real\" IT job. I still know nothing at all. But the damn place just works. I will give you an example. When my first PC died I asked the guy if there was an image. He said he had no clue, the Sysadmin handled the PC's. \n\nEvidently in this company of 450 PC's The Sysadmin handled installing every one. He then tells me that when one came in, he just took it straight to the user and plugged it in. So I saunter over the users desk and simply plug it in. And to my amateur eyes magic happens. It boots gets an image (from somewhere I had no clue) and boots and all the software needed is there. I assume that the user needs their documents. Nope all there. I have since learned about roaming profiles.\n\nWe just wing everything because everything just works. I have no access to the backup, because we don't have his passwords and my coworker gets an email everyday of the local servers being booted on an Azure server I don't have access to. But everyday the email comes in and shows all 19 servers running on some cloud server. It made me nervous. But at least they are being backed up. I know it sounds horrid, but I simply have no clue how to access them. And I am kinda worried that I took too long to admit it now.\n\nWhen a new user was hired, I googled how to create a new user and found out about AD. Yep, had no clue about that. So I Google how to do it and log into the DC and create his account. I just copy a person from the same department and thank the gods the printers and network shares they need just show up. This is how lost I am.\n\nAnother example is that a battery backup in the server rack started beeping. I was nervous as hell, but when I looked the front of the APC has label-maker tape on it saying the model of battery enclosed and the date it was changed. Again I had to learn nothing.\n\nBut then two days ago it finally happened. Something the autopilot couldn't fix. The firewall died. I immediately was a nervous wreck. I told the owners and they found the vendor from Accounting that sold us the old one. We call the vender and they overnight a new Netgate firewall, and it comes in and I spend the whole day trying to make it work. I am at wits end as I have no damn clue what a NAT (found that word while Googling) is, or even what the WAN should be.\n\nI eventually go to one of the owners, and explain that I simply cant fix this. I have no idea if there are configs saved somewhere I could use, but I simply cannot fix this. I am defeated. I expected to get fired, truthfully. I know I have no clue what I am doing.\n\nHe then tells me he needs to grab something that may help. He then comes back with an envelope that The Sysadmin left. He said that he had forgotten about it. In it is a thumbdrive with a note that says the password is taped on top of the last server rack. Our server room is locked so I assume that it is a secure place to leave a password. I take the drive and then go to the last server rack with a step stool and find an index card with a freaking million character password.\n\nI go to my computer and plug in the drive and am presented with a decrypt password. The drive is only 4 gigs, so I can't imagine anything on it is helpful. But I plug in the password and there is a single txt document. I open it and there is a link with a user name and password. I click the link and it takes me to a private Wikipedia. EVERYTHING IS IN THERE!!!!\n\nThe thing is huge. But in it is all the IP's, passwords, instructions, and everything. It has 1789 entries. Every single device has an entry. I search for Netgate and it takes me to a pfSense page. That page lists everything too. IP's, services, firewall rules all of it. \n\nIt took me two hours but with just that page I managed to piece together a working firewall. I don't know what half of what I typed does, but damn it worked! \n\nI am in awe of this thing. Azure server access, every server, every freaking MAC address is annoted. There is a network diagram that list every single printer, router, access point, server, all of it with IP and MAC Address.\n\nIt even has his ramblings in it on things that he cant figure out. There was an a part of the firewall page that was him bemoaning that the DNS resolver (no clue what that is) wont work with locking down port 53. \n\nI just want to tell the everyone that I would buy him all the whiskey he could drink if I knew where he was now. TC, if you by any chance are reading this...I LOVE YOU!\n\n\nEdit: I realize I am woefully unqualified for even my helpdesk role.  Nor will I be for the next six months (though I do know what WSUS is now...woot!), but dammit I am all this company has right now.  I might not be the helpdesk guy they need, but I am the one they deserve for even hiring me.\n\nEdit2: Update, I sent the thread to management.  They now see that I am not overblowing how incapable I am at being a Sysadmin currently.  We are going to find a Company to bring into to help with the big stuff.  Said my job is safe, and that they would be fine with using a company until I can digest what everything does.  Told me to not worry, and thanked me for being so candid.  I am also required to backup the wiki before I leave today since they now get how important it is.  \n\nEdit3: Welp, I got my co-worker inadvertently in \"trouble\".  Did not think about kind of throwing him under the bus when I pushed this thread higher.  Owner informed him, that he would have to do more than printer support.  Though they appreciated the great printer support.  Told him I would buy him lunch all next week.  He is unaware of this thread.  Thinks I ratted directly, which I knew did.\n\nEdit4: Contact made via text now with old Sysadmin.  He is far younger than I thought.  I assumed he would be an old crusty fogey, but when he asked my age I asked in turn.  Dude is in his 30's.  He invited me for drinks, I mentioned again I am 19 and he said I could have a soda in a sippy cup.  We are meeting in an hour.  My first bar trip!\n\nEdit5: Told owner I was going to meet him.  He gave me a $100 to pay for everything.  Also asked me to change a few things to help hide company identity in this thread.  He is reading every comment.\n\nEdit6:  I keep getting asked about the DNS resolver issue, here is the instruction from the wiki.  I am going to pull from the GUI page (yes there is a command page and a GUI page in the wiki).\n\n***DNS Resolver & Forwarder Below***\n\n1.) Assuming that you have completed the above requirements, first you have to change your DNS on pfsense to OPENDNS. To do this, go to Systems > General Setup. Under DNS Server Settings\n\n2.) DNS Server 1: 208.67.222.222\n\n3.) DNS Server 2: 208.67.220.220\n\n4.) DNS Server Override: Unchecked\n\n5.) Disable DNS Forwarder: Checked\n\n6.) Once you finished, click Save to save all the setting you entered\n\n7.) Once you completed the above process, you need to disable DNS Resolver and enable DNS Forwarder.\n\n8.) I am not sure if DNS Resolver can be configured with OpenDNS/Umbrella, I tried to configure it but no luck. With DNS Forwarder, everything worked well. At this point I really don't care.\n\n9.) To do this, you need to go to Services > DNS Resolver > Enable: (Unchecked)\n\n10.) After that, Go to Services > DNS Forwarder > Enable: Checked\n\n11.) Interfaces: All\n\n12.) Click Save\n\n13.) Navigate to Firewall > NAT, Port Forward tab\n\n14.) Click Add to create a new rule\n\n15.) Fill in the following fields on the port forward rule:\n\n        Interface: LAN\n\n        Protocol: TCP/UDP\n\n        Destination: Invert Match checked, LAN Address\n\n        Destination Port Range: 53 (DNS)\n\n        Redirect Target IP: 127.0.0.1\n\n        Redirect Target Port: 53 (DNS)\n\n        Description: Redirect DNS\n\n        NAT Reflection: Disable\n\n\n\nHopefully the above helps answer the questions!

Of course, the authorized service center didn't have the spare parts available in stock, I had to go into 2 weeks waiting period with no laptop replacement until they managed to get the new boards. \n\nThis goes on for FOUR TIMES (4), the laptops had their motherboard replaced for 4 times. each time forcing me to have 2 weeks waiting period. I estimate the cost of board replacement now is way more than the laptop prices. this is all done under warranty. \n\nContacted HP support center, and explained that this can't keep on happening, I need a solution by replacing or refund, I just got off the phone with their representative, they basically gave me the middle finger and said I should buy the \"HP Premium Accidental Damage Protection\" to extend the warranty for another year or so. They also claimed that we're doing something wrong on the software side that keeps on frying the boards O_o? like...wtf?\n\nUpon refusing this lame ass solution, they said that replacing/refunding at this point is no longer an option. And here I am stuck with laptops that keeps on randomly failing.\n\nI will never again touch a piece of hardware with the HP logo on it, fook this shit!\n\n**Edit:** Holy shit this exploded! here are some answers:  \n\n- Laptops are bought from a local vendor, vendor said they can only keep replacing the motherboard, they're the one who recommend that I actually contact HP directly.\n- My local VAR is shit, they won't left a finger if it doesn't benefit them one way or another.\n- Will try the suggested \"hold the power button 90 seconds or so\" trick at the next unexpected random laptop failure cycle. I do remember doing something like that before but it didn't do anything. \n- Lots of references to Lemon laws, I will have to check if we have something similar here. \n- ProLiant is the only thing I can honestly say good about HP, rest is shit! \n- Lenovo is king specially those T series laptops, like one of the comments below \"tank\" of a laptop.\n",
