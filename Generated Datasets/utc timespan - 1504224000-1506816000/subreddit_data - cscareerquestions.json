Do they want you to get very technical and detailed to the point of talking about details of the code itself? Or do they prefer it if you kept it higher level and only focus on design/architecture and the larger components of a system?\n\nWhat about problems that aren't strictly technical. For instance, if there was a lot of ambiguity in the project requirements, or other business obstacles that we had to get around to finish our work? Would these be good things to talk about or would they be seen as a cop-out?\n\nAnother thing I'm concerned about is, what if my \"hard problem/challenge\" is perceived as something simple or easy by the interviewer and they think I'm incompetent as a result.\n\nWould appreciate hearing everyone's thoughts about this.",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone, hopefully I'm not breaking any rules. I read the FAQ but I'm not really sure.\n\nAnyway, I still have two years of high school to go, but I'm discussing college options with my parents. They're really big on my taking a gap year, which I'm OK with (in principle). I have dual citizenship (US and another country in the EU) that has conscription for 9 months (I would do civil service, not military), and they're half-jokingly encouraging me to serve. This isn't a big deal, I've had plenty of uncles who just don't visit the other country between 26 and 35 and get off the hook free. I have no intention of moving there any time soon. \n\nHowever, I have a part-time job right now, that pays me a fair bit above minimum wage. If I'm going to spend a year off, I might as well make some money and acquire concrete skills rather than sweeping floors in a post office. I brought this up, and they like that idea as well. Neither of my parents are have any technical jobs whatsoever, but they do want to know how much I might make. I don't feel comfortable talking to the other people I work with about salary-related stuff so I'd like to get an answer here: how much could I earn  yearly in a CS job given my skills?\n\nI don't have any certifications (I did get a 5 on APCS but I know that doesn't mean much). Assume that I'll use LeetCode, FireCode, CTCI, and HackerRank for ~3 months to prep for interviews. \n\nHere's some information about myself:\n\n* Location: DC Metro but willing to relocate\n* School: 11th grade at top STEM HS\n* 2 combined years of school CS: APCS equivalent and Data Structures (Java), currently taking Web Apps (NodeJS)\n* Fluent (native level)  in 3+ languages (English/French/German/some Mandarin), not sure if that matters\n* Won internship that turned into the part time job at a hackathon. Worked 400+ hours over the summer\n\nHere are the languages/technologies I'm comfortable with:\n\n* Java: Used to be my main language until I moved over to Python. Worked with a bunch of APIs, data structures, etc...\n* Python: Self-taught myself over a weekend because I wanted to be able to use it on a Monday for my job. Did some more API work, also used Flask\n* HTML/CSS: I understand these well. I also worked on mobile-responsiveness in Bootstrap 3/4\n* JS: For now, I'm only using pure JS, did some really basic stuff. I'm learning Node in school but it's not my priority because most of my work is in Flask or HTML\n* Git/Slack: These seem to be pretty standard\n* Adobe CC: I use XD a lot, I'm learning Illustrator. I have basic Photoshop skill \n\nLooking at what I've written, I realize that this post is *really* long. That said, I'd appreciate some insight. \n\n",

            "selftext": "I graduated this past May and started working at a company that has a training program. The company is a very big company so it uses a lot of different languages, so it wasn't apparent where I would be heading after the training was over, so I was pretty excited to get to use a variety of different languages. \n\nThe training program was pretty good and I got exposed to several different newer languages, but I ended up being placed on a team where it is looking like I will be primarily be using COBOL. It's an older company and there's still a ton going on within the company that deals with COBOL, so I wasn't the only one that this happened to. \n\nAnyways, I'm wondering what I should do going forward. While this company is evidence that COBOL is still alive and kicking, I don't want to make a career out of it. My plan currently is to learn as much Java on the side as I can and then try to get a job with that in the future. \n\nBy the way, I am an Information Systems major. I did have around 3 programming classes during college, but I have quite a bit of catching up to do before I am on the same level as a Comp Sci graduate. I'm currently going through the University of Helsinki's MOOC, reading through Oracle's Java tutorials, as well as trying to do some problems on Hackerrank (the easy ones for now haha). I also plan on doing a couple of side projects. Hopefully I will be able to become proficient enough with doing this on the side to get a job doing development work with Java. \n\nSo, one of my questions is, how long should I stay with this company before I start looking for other jobs? 8 months, a year, two years? I don't want to get pigeon holed by only having COBOL experience, but I also don't know how soon it would be okay to start looking. \n\nMy other questions are how does my plan sound and how adept at Java do I need to become before I can contribute as a developer at another company? \n\nAny advice on the situation and learning Java is much appreciated!",

Therefore I only rely on my work experience, and to be honest I could easily find a new well paid job anytime here in London. It seems employers just don't care about Bachelor's and Master's around here.\n\nNow the thing is, I really want to move out of London and experience another country, so I wonder what would be the best way to move to San Francisco and get a job there. Do you think it's feasible as a web developer to get a H1B visa or something like that, to get started there and later on upgrade to a green card and possibly citizenship? How would you approach this? Would you just go to LinkedIn and message CTOs or plain employees based San Francisco? Or rather look at job ads? I know I could find some information on Google, but I rather want to hear your experience or opinion.\n\nThanks guys!",

            "selftext": "I have been working as a junior programmer for a small company with few \"old-school\" programmers for some months as my first job. The reason I say \"old-school\" is because these 2 other programmers managed to implement great functionality to make the business successful (they are core of the company), but basic software engineering practices are non-existent:  no version control, unit testing, documentation, functions/structure in code, comments... every file of code has half of its lines commented out (code of older functionality). Everything is written in Perl or PHP.\n\nI'm in a situation where I frequently make mistakes which seem careless. For example, it's not the first time I ran an update query which updated more data than intended or I did not debug properly and assumed certain actions and was wrong or pushed a file with syntax errors and I did not notice for some time. I think that the problem is that I can't concentrate because I'm trying to understand someone else's code without help, have a lot of pressure by managers and clients to deliver, office environment is not that good... Furthermore, most of my colleagues have too basic of an idea of programming to relate to my situation.\n\nBut I don't think these are things to defend myself by when I make a mistake... or are they? Are these mistakes common/normal within the industry? How do I save face under these conditions? Every time I make such stupid mistakes, I feel immensely nervous and embarassed. Maybe it's time to look for a job with better programming standards... or to change career.",

            "selftext": "I'm at a crossroads, and could a little advice and insight.\n\nI love creating software, having written my first program in first grade, and have been in the industry about 18 years. I'm a \"type B\" personality, a fairly quiet person, and good at collaborating, but unfortunately terrible at the non-work chit chat and BS-ing part of teamwork in the real world.\n\nDespite never asking for a promotion or raise, I've had good career velocity and was well rewarded even at the Senior level. I was regularly near the top end of the spectrum for rewards. \n\nHowever, after a promotion a few years ago I've found myself in the middle of the pack, which led to an odd situation: compared to when I was performing near the top of my peer group previously, my total compensation went down. The *potential* rewards (stock, bonuses) went way up, but I'm now also competing with much more driven people across the entire division. Smart people who, unlike me, are increasingly interested in politics and climbing the ladder, etc. (Sometimes more interested in the latter than building a better product, unfortunately.)\n\n**As a general question, is this common?** It wasn't exactly the Peter Principle since I was doing fine and base pay was bumped. However, stock and bonuses are rewarded disproportionately to those at the top of their level, and I was in the middle.\n\nThen Life happened. I'll skip the details (trauma, low coping skills, personal issue) and just say I made a lateral move to a non-lead position and am having a hard time getting back into a good rhythm. At my level I don't get assigned tasks, and am lucky to even be given a goal. Usually it's someone waving in a vague direction, and it's up to me to identify opportunities and problems that need solving.\n\nThe autonomy is awesome, but I've been less than successful, and communication with management hasn't been great either. I have a strong feeling I'm going to get managed out. Another lateral move is a challenge, so for the first time I'm considering leaving.\n\nAs a \"lifer\", the prospects of starting over are daunting.\n\nFirst, I haven't sent out a resume or done an interview in close to two decades. I have a decent LinkedIn profile and contacts all over the \"Big 4\", and their recruiters occasionally reach out. Until now I've just told people I'm happy where I am. I'm also not in the bay area or likely to move there.\n\nSecond, while I'm not pigeon holed too badly, my best analogy while trying to be anonymous would be if I were a long-time developer on Photoshop. That is, I excel at native code, mainly C++, and complex application and system-level programming, and know a very large code base better than almost anybody else, but have zero background in things like web development or databases. I was successful as a lead because I could lean on deep technical skills, and am not comfortable trying to do the opposite by becoming a lead in a new area and later learning the technology. (I've seen few people in my career do that well.)\n\nFinally, after Life happened I realized I could no longer work 50-60+ hour weeks. When recruiters ping me they generally try to up-sell in terms of luring me to a position where I can have an even broader impact by working on the foundations of an upcoming product, or by leading a large team of people.\n\n**Second question: thoughts on staying where I am and trying to make it work, vs. seeking new opportunities?**\n\nMy best objective plan is to start networking and getting some interviewing experience, though that's a time sink. I don't want to start right away with my first interview since college being at a place I narrowed down as my favorite choice...",

I think basically a verbal agreement so far.\n\nI know at startups the base pay isn't as great as larger companies and sometimes that's compensated with stock options. I don't know much about stocks and RSU's but I'm confident in this company's ability to grow revenue at this point, so I would be open to that.\n\nFor the area, Glassdoor says the average pay for an entry level/junior SWE is $80k and average SWE is $100k. That seems right as the area isn't as expensive as the Bay Area (avg. $118k/year for 'SWE' I believe), but still a coastal city (I'm thinking I can find an apartment $1.5-2k/month near work - less if I live with roommates).\n\nHow do I approach this when it comes time to negotiating? Is it realistic to expect around $80-85k + RSU's or if I do get RSU's does that mean I should expect a lower base salary <$75k? Glassdoor salaries don't really tell you the base salary contrasted with shares developers receive so I'm kind of stumped here. Any other general advice and things I should look for or push for? How do you approach negotiating?\n\nHonestly I have no clue what I'm doing when it comes to things like this.",

Perhaps my background in business is advantageous (at least more so than other completely unrelated fields).  My question is, from current professionals in the industry, what is your recommendation as far as schooling.  \n\nI've become aware of bootcamps after an advertisement from General Assembly (13-week intensive, M-F all day schooling for a whopping $13k).  I saw another post here mention a lot of these shut down eventually.  When I talked to a GA rep she mentioned most of the employers are start-ups that hire from these camps.\n\nDo I need to get another degree?  Masters?  Or is it enough to stick with W3Schools and online teaching tools.  My friend who has been very successful in his career said learning from the community is the best way because what's taught in schools if often quite outdated (as is usually the case with anything, but especially something so rapidly evolving as computer science).  I guess, what would be the best option moving forward to switch into CS 1. As economically as possible, and 2. In the least amount of time 3. That would lead to a full-time job in this field.  What are the best platforms/avenues to learn on a project-basis since that's a lot easier to learn than by staring at a screen trying to memorize tags.\n\nSo far I have very elementary knowledge of HTML5 and CSS but the complexity is quite daunting.  I guess I'm looking for real world answers on if the degree is really necessary, or if my current business degree has enough transferable skills that it would suffice if I learned the programming languages on top of it.\n\nMaybe what would also be useful is a breakdown of what languages are most necessary and helpful for each kind of career, AND the order it's best to learn them in (if not simultaneously).  For example, C Sharp for game design, JavaScript for UI, etc.",

For example, if a resume is gone through manually by a person anyways, couldn't they just click a \"Reject\" button if they don't want to proceed and then the applicant is notified of this?  (Doesn't have to be a formal e-mail or anything, it just shows up as a short message on the applicant's job page.)  Or if a resume is read in an automated fashion and it doesn't pass the filter, then there is a mechanism in place to then inform the applicant of this rejection?  Or if there are too many resumes to read then after a certain time frame a resume on the queue becomes \"too stale\", is automatically removed, and the rejected applicant is automatically pinged or the jobs page is updated with a short rejection message?\n\nPlease understand that I actually am genuinely curious as to what is going on as opposed to complaining.\n\nFor example, Bloomberg notified me within 5 days that they rejected me at the resume review stage and my opinion of them actually went up because of that.

Hope I get some input here :). \n\nI am trying to figure out what career paths are possible for security people like me. My profile is:\n\n* In late 20's, located in Western Europe\n* Strong technical background (computer engineering BSc & MSc with heavy security element) but not a strong programmer/CS\n* Hobbies include linux, homelab etc\n* 2 years experience as security consultant/ penetration tester at big4 accounting firm (Deloitte, KPMG, EY, PWC)\n* OSCP (badge of honor - it cost many of my free hours)\n* Ambitious, learning quickly, good at reporting/presenting etc\n* Don't wanna become an excel-sheet auditor/accountant. Don't like suiting up but tolerate it because job.\n\n**The problem**: I feel that the security business is booming, I have good education and brain, yet I'm stuck solving elementary problems for clients (please retire win2003, it was too easy to become domain admin) and getting paid a bit over ramen salary, just like any other auditor/accountant out of uni, with no specialization in security.\n\n**The ideal**: To work on interesting problems that impact the world and get compensated nicely, then ludicrously in the future.\n\nI think I see three career options:\n\n1. Keep doing what I'm doing, remain an auditor/pentester and get paid increasingly more, but still on-par with non-security accountants. No major improvement of technical skills. Then one day I will be able to jump to a small company's C-role because I'll have management experience and I can translate pentest findings into business impact. Good money, boring & tiring career.\n2. Get a 'real' engineering job e.g. security engineer at a company that makes a product. Probably devops. Salary should be a bit better but not much. What is the growth path there, though? Will I be fired when I'm 40 and will be slower on the terminal than a 25-y-o? Also, having no professional experience in coding (just school projects) I may be unable to get this job.\n3. Get a job at a startup or big4 tech company (Google etc). Money should be much-much better and I would be working on important, new problems such as the Next Big Thing (cringe, but you know what I mean). Again, what happens when I'm 45 and too old to use the terminal? What kind of salary/job can I have then? Could I have enough to retire? Also, I'm really not sure I have the skills for this.\n\nWhat are your views/suggestions? \nAm I missing something?\n\nCheers",

Specifically companies like Two Sigma/Jane St/Jump/Citadel/etc.\n\n- Is your job actually challenging? Some of what I've read on here and some of the conversations I've been having make it sound like software engineers are only there to be secretaries for the quants. My background is in a numerical field and I have a decent understanding of the hardware my code runs on, but there doesn't seem to be any low level work - everyone is using java/python/C++ and doesn't look at performance beyond big O.\n- If I work 9-5 will I be fired? If I ignore work calls after 5pm will I be fired? I have bigger things in my life than work. I'd much rather work for a company that can find value in my skills rather than in how long I spend at the office.\n- What kind of total comp should I be looking at? I don't think I would make the move south for less than \u00a3130k, but considering people coming out of school are make \u00a380k today that actually seems too low.\n\nThanks in advance",

I'm a recent graduate with zero experience. He said it could eventually lead to a developer role.

            "selftext": "Sorry everybody for the long post and rant :(\n\nAt my last job I honestly thought about quitting coding all together. The job paid $9 an hour. I was the only in office developer and I took the job because I never officially had a degree and wanted to get my foot in the door. Could someone be honest if I was just being too picky or had too much high expectations? I quit the job a few months ago and will be going back to college. Here\u2019s my experience:\n\n\nHe delayed my interview by a few hours twice. I was going to school for an associates and had another job on a tight schedule but I worked with it. He never even got up to shake my hand and never said anything, he literally stood in front of me in the interview typed an email for 30 minutes before getting started. \n\n\nI had to explain literally all the code I wrote to the manager despite there being comments. \n\n\nManager use to confuse java and JavaScript and send me java code despite me explaining I wrote JavaScript and saying he think it\u2019s the same and asked me to run an \u201conline converter\u201d to convert the code. \n\n\nArgued with me about how to define a variable in JavaScript. \n\n\n\u201cTried\u201d getting me to hack into a clients website. He was asking if there was anyway possible to change the code \u201cwithout having access to it.\u201d\n\n\nWas 5-6 hours late for every meeting (yes every single one). I worked 9-5 and he would schedule meetings at 12 then show up and try to start the meeting 4 hours later. \n\nAfter being 4-5 hours late to meetings he\u2019d ignore me to send emails then complain about not understanding or missing something after. Every meeting was 4-5 hours long.  \n\n\nHad an attitude problem and talked down to every employee. He literally bad mouthed every employee to other employees. \n\n\nHe wanted to move me to a \u201ctech support\u201d role after hiring me for dev. After moving me he didn\u2019t want to train me and referred another employee to teach me that also didn\u2019t understand the job. He use to get angry and say he\u2019s busy when I asked for help and had an attitude when I never understood what I needed to do since I wasn\u2019t hired for this role and had no experience in it. There was like 7 of us in office and no one else understood. \n\n\nI got scrutinized once because I \u201ctook too long\u201d to teach myself to use the new product he was getting ready to roll out. While learning how to use it he expected me to also write documentation, test for bugs and understand how everything works. I was 15 minutes in, asked for help, he said I took too long and got angry. How tf am I suppose to train myself, document it and test for bugs in 15 minutes. \n\n\nI asked for a raise once because it was $9 an hour. I had a job in retail and was getting ready to be promoted but he lied about raises and the \u201cprobation period\u201d and pressured me to quit my job to work there full time despite me applying for a part time role. When asking for the raise I was full stack dev, helped other employees with testing and also tech support. He said \u201chonestly I don\u2019t think you deserve it. You\u2019re not quite there yet.\u201d I would\u2019ve been okay if he was professional and said no but I\u2019m not doing fucking 3 jobs as a junior dev for $9 an hour. \n\n\nI was there less than a year and quit and I am now going to college for a bachelors because I couldn\u2019t find another dev job with an associates. I don\u2019t regret it. I was having panic attacks, anxiety attacks etc but I told myself to suck it up for the experience but I just couldn\u2019t do it. I couldn\u2019t deal with his attitude, his mannerisms, the disrespect etc. \n\n\nI thought about quitting dev all together but I love coding too much to ever do that. I will probably be in college for a few more years. Any ideas on how to avoid shitty places like this. Just thinking about it gets me hot. Was I being too picky? What would you have done?",

She replied that she still does not have approval for an offer, that they do not compete with other locations, and that I should make my decision \"solely on A\".  This leads me to believe that there is a chance that B won't extend an offer if I do decline A, so I'm in an awkward position. On top of all this, when I asked A (who's already offered me a position) about my start date, they told me that it'd be \"sometime in the next few months\", but as soon as November, so I'm kind of in limbo here.

I took to CS much more strongly than ChemE and knew pretty quickly that I wanted to work in tech when I graduated, perhaps involving my engineering degree somehow. \n\nMy questions: Any advice on applying for jobs with a minor as opposed to a major of CS? Should I just include my CS GPA (4.0) on my resume and drop my cGPA(3.3), or would that be strange? \n\nAlso, when do seniors in this industry start applying for jobs? I know in ChemE it isn't uncommon to start applying basically now. \n\nBTW, I am located in Silicon Valley and would prefer to work in San Francisco (where I live).\n\nThanks!",

Fair enough it was my first job and I thought it would be a good learning experience. \n\nLong story short I resigned due to bullying and victimisation from management and joined another company that mostly specializes in enterprise .NET, Java and NodeJS. \n\nHowever the first project they put me on was a mobile application that had a successful Android launch and they need an iOS version. I joined because the project sounded really fascinating despite them saying I will be back on iOS but I will have a chance to do some .NET and Android on the same project. They didn't lie and I have managed to do some other work outside of iOS (which was fantastic, I absolutely love Java and C#)\n\nHowever, despite this, I have a fear that I may have type casted myself as an iOS developer due to the scarcity of native Objective C and Swift experience. It's not difficult to see why. I really hate developing for iOS. I hate Xcode. I hate Cocoapods. Hate it all.

DePaul also accepted me, they have great classes, but it stands on a similar level in comparison to UIS credentially yet costs more than double.\n\nI don't mind paying more as long as the name is better than UIS or DePaul.

When I turned in my two-week notice I made it clear to my boss that I will finish up my work and leave it to him to inform the team. I really don't think he did that and no one has asked about taking over my work. \n\nMy question is, should I be discreet when I leave or can I say good-bye to a few people? What is considered good-form in this situation? \n\nEDIT:\nThanks for all the advice. Just go give some info everyone is asking. I've been at this job for less than a year. I don't hate the company or the people, I'm just leaving because it's a bad fit for me. I've explained the whole situation here (long read):\n\n https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6xd0vp/quitting_soon_want_to_get_the_most_out_of_it/?ref=share&ref_source=link\n\nThere are a few people I talk to more than others but it's mostly saying 'hi' or about work, it's not even at the watercooler chit-chat stage. The reason I asked this question is because most people say the professional thing to do is to let your boss break the news to your team. This was actually how it was done at my previous job (one before this one), my boss told everyone during the staff meeting. Of course I was at that one much longer. But in this case, my boss didn't actually tell the team. So I wanted to know can I still say 'good bye' to people. Most of them are connected with me on LinkedIn but I don't want to give them the impression I'm disgruntled (I'm not) at the same time since my boss didn't say anything to them I don't want to seem like I'm starting a scene on my last day.",

            "selftext": "Hi, so I guess I'm wondering what is wrong here. Full disclosure, my GPA from my previous major, Civil Engineering, is garbage (2.3). I have a good resume, I interview pretty well, and while I'm not the best programmer in the world, I can definitely write code.\n\n\nEveryone I've asked in person has seen my resume and says \"yeah you should have no problem\", but it has been really difficult. I have a few months of burn time, but if I don't find an internship or contract work or something within the next few months I might have to stop going to school. The weird thing is... I have no trouble finding real jobs. I get more interviews from companies who confuse my application as being for an SWE position than for actual internships. That I haven't graduated, am in school, and am looking for an internship is incredibly obvious on my resume, the first 3 lines, and I explicitly say that I'm looking for an internship in my cover letters.\n\n\nI've probably applied to 50 or 60 internships in the last 2 months, if not more, and it's been crickets. 3 interviews in total. When I was actually looking for real work my response rate was easily 2-3x that. I don't want to leave school, and I'm dead set on finishing because I actually love the stuff I'm learning, but at this point I'll need to get a retail job or start driving uber to keep afloat during. There's nothing at all wrong with that, please don't mistake me, I just don't understand why nobody wants to pay me to write code for less money.\n\n\nI'd rather not post my real resume on reddit, but if you're curious to see it, feel free to pm and I'll be happy to show it to you.\n\n\nI know this isn't a real question, I'm just at a loss and really don't know where to go. I feel like I'm taking crazy pills because everyone is saying \"oh you shouldn't be having any trouble\" after looking at it, but the proof is in the pudding. I'm at a loss, really, and trying not to let it impact my self-esteem. It definitely does, though. My career wasn't where I wanted it to be prior to going to school, and the caliber of company I'm applying to for internships is much more prestigious. I've always fought to keep myself from thinking that I'm a second-rate programmer, I mean, I'm aware of impostor syndrome and all of that. It is very hard not to let this whole thing get the better of me.",

Any advice would be appreciated. \n\nTLDR: Just laid off, still a novice, don't know if I should find a job or look for formal education, or what to study for finding a job.

(I'll also tell you that this is for Apple and is not a new-grad position.) The signing bonus in particular looks very, very small.\n\nI used some of what others told me last time and made clear my disappointment; the recruiter responded by letting me know he would work on making the offer better if it helped seal the deal. I gave no hard numbers, just asked for time to think about the offer. I think he tried to make me feel bad (reiterating that it was a great offer), and also seemed to suggest that he couldn't get much higher on the RSU. Also he said that if he went back to them, the offer he came back with would likely be the final one.\n\nI'm sure all of those are standard tactics, but I'm feeling pretty undervalued, especially given all the other salaries I'm seeing around here. The \"Apple name\" isn't worth nothing, but it won't pay bills.\n\nAny help at all would be most kind! Specifically, what should be my counteroffer? It's so low that I'm not sure how to get it in the average range for 4-5 year experience software devs. I've seen anywhere from $170-220k total compensation.\n\nThanks Reddit! <3",

            "selftext": "Hi all, I realize this is a bit of a nebulous question.  I'm a junior in college, did chemical/environmental engineering for my first two years (hated it), and now I'm in computer science.  I did an edX intro to computer science in python course over the summer and quite liked it.  I also wanted to do/study something practical and that I could do NOW, and CS is pretty perfect for that, isn't it?\n\nI've been very back and forth on my journey so far.  Somedays I really love coding and have great ideas for projects and I just want to envelop myself in my IDE...other days all the languages/tools/technologies I need to know for internships/jobs/etc. seem so damn overwhelming, and just thinking about programming fills me with anxiety.  This feeds on my fear of not being able to find internships or jobs (I have student loans, and this is always in the back of my mind...honestly it is so depressing, they make me feel like I'm trapped) because I'm not experienced enough.  I get so overwhelmed and anxious and depressed, it makes me feel like I want to drop out of college.  I'm decently proficient in Python at this point, but my only project I've done so far is creating a reddit bot.  I'm really trying to secure an internship for the summer, but all I know is Python and a little bit of SQL from a GIS course I took last year.\n\nMy other problem is that I often feel that I don't want to be confined to a regular 9-5 office job.  I find monotony soul crushing.  I also love being outdoors; hiking, camping, climbing, you name it.  I know for a lot of IT jobs it would be near impossible to reconcile this difference.  \n\nI'm really having trouble figuring out what I want to do with my life.  Half the days I feel motivated to want to become some type of software developer and finish my education...the other half I want to go do a service year and spend my career/time outdoors.  It doesn't help that I also have constant anxiety that I will never be a goos programmer, I'll never learn all the best tools and technology to use, etc.  Honestly, the truth probably lies somewhere between.  I feel like I would love a job that allows me to go out in the field half the time, and spend the other half in an office/lab.\n\nSorry if it seemed like I was rambling.  Does anybody have any advice for a struggling college student?  I would really appreciate it.",

Still, again, best way to learn is to slam your head against the wall until it breaks, then take notes on how to more efficiently break similar walls in the future.\n\nThis is my passion, and I'm always paranoid I might not be advancing fast enough.

I often get questions such as \"how many years of data science experience do you have?\"  And I'm not sure how to answer this.\n\nMy current approach is to include the years of experience I have using R and python to clean, analyze and automate data processes, and not include the years of experience I have with only using SPSS.

I know that is very little compared to what other people have suggested, but I've tried to apply only to ones that are in my location && I meet at least 70/80% of the qualifications.\n\nOf that 40 or so, I've gotten about 4 and of those 4, 2 of which I've actually went on-site (incidentally, these were the only ones that had a little coding quiz before).  Only one of those was a technical - I thought I did okay, except for one question about SQL, which I really need to learn more about.\n\nHere's my resume: \nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/wjz7otw8zw4h0x9/res.pdf?dl=0\n\nLong story short, I set myself up to work in education, but I have too many doubts about it now.  I went back to school for a masters to see if academia was for me while thinking about what I'd really like to do.  I realized the most rewarding experiences I had were working on projects for my CS courses - ones that I really enjoyed more than most.\n\nSo I understand that I certainly lack the amount of experience and skill sets required to get into the field.  So here are some things I thought might help to change my situation: I could\n\n1\\.  Chop off the non-developer stuff, which includes all my teaching experience (which I doubted before, as that leaves me with nothing - other than my one-time TAing for an algorithms course - but what I have currently doesn't seem to be working)\n\n2\\.  Chop off my awards section, as no one really seems to care about\n\nBut that doesn't really leave me with much; fortunately, I did finish my CS major during my undergrad, so I guess I could\n\n3\\.  Include major projects (semester long ones); unfortunately, I only have two of these that I could really mention, so might I include some of the more minor ones?\n\nOutside of that, over the years, I have done a lot of project euler and participated in random events like PyWeek.  So\n\n4\\.  I've been trying to update my git repo with things I've done over the years, even if they're just solutions to some coding problems.  Is this a good idea?\n\n5\\.  Trying to get into contributing to open source, although that seems like a rather lofty goal for me (currently).\n\nSo perhaps a better choice would be to:\n\n6\\.

            "selftext": "I would love to get some advice about a couple things from you guys!\n\n**Background:** Technology has always been a passion for me. When I was 13, I started learning HTML (self-taught) and how to build a webpage. For about the next year or so, I built a couple practice webpages and dabbled some more in HTML/CSS. Around the age of 16, I started to get into Android development (ROMs and the like). I taught myself how to use Github, Linux, a little Java, and coding off some guides on XDA. I compiled a few ROMs successfully but my computer wasn't the highest quality and took a while to compile so I ended up fading that out. At the age of 18, as I was preparing to head to college after high school graduation, life handed me a surprise in the form of a baby boy. Long story short I put college on hold and went into retail. After realizing that was a giant mistake, I headed into an escrow business facilitating the closing of homes. I have been in this profession for two and a half years and I have realized two things: 1) I hate it and 2) It doesn't even pay good enough to make hating it OK. I am much more stable now with my wife as far as finances go, a home, etc. so my thoughts have wondered to going to college for a degree in a technology field to set us up better for the future.\n\n**Questions:**\n\n* With my wife working, my son now 4, and having a full time job myself, I would need the degree to be a pure online-program. I live in WA state and have seen some good things about City U of Seattle but they only have a BS in Information Systems, which leads to my next question.\n\n* Is a BS in CS the best route to go if I am not 100% sure which field of technology I want to make my career in? From what I've read so far, you don't want to paint yourself into a corner with a specific degree. Instead, with CS being a giant umbrella of a degree, you can take that schooling into numerous different avenues. Is this the correct thinking? Is there a large difference between Information Systems and Computer Science degrees?\n\n* I am lucky enough that both my parents and grandparents would pay for me to go through college and they are not requiring me to go in-state (although to make it easier on them, I would prefer to remain in WA). For this reason, would it be better to go to a more well-known school such as University of Florida, which seems popular for CS? Does the school make that much of a difference?\n\n* I've seen a lot about online schooling (without a degree) such as Udacity, Khan Academy, etc. and I am interested in trying out one of those programs before I take off on the course of obtaining a degree. While I've self-taught and thoroughly enjoyed learning code, I want to make sure it's not just a hobby before I assume it would be a good fit career-wise. Are there any online schoolings that you guys would recommend above the others for a general outline of coding?\n\n**TL;DR** With my current lifestyle, an online degree in CS will be the best fit. I live in WA and would prefer in-state but can go out of state as well. Which schools would you guys recommend for online-only CS degrees? Also, is a CS degree that much more different than a BS in Information Systems/Management Systems/etc.?",

I still haven't received any responses yet. It's been exactly 2.5 days since I emailed her the infamous emoticon, this is only increasing the tension.** ",

I haven't had the easiest time finding a job. I feel that part of it is because I have a bad a GPA. But there is partly a reason why I do. I know that it's ultimately my own fault, but it's something that genuinely affected. During the summer of my sophmore year my father had died. I hadn't gotten into the CS major yet but I was getting close. So once school had started up again I had a hard time with school. I know looking back now that I probably should have taken sometime off from school to spend time with my family and to collect myself, but I didn't want to. I felt that if I did, I would never go back. I was also out of the country when my dad died so I hard time handling his death because the last time we spoke it wasn't on the best terms. So i continued going to school and passed my classes, sometimes I did well and others not so well. So upon graduating I ended up with a sub 3.0 GPA. I never mention it to recruiters in any way what happened because I feel that I am making an excuse for my own laziness. But others have told me it's not an excuse, but a genuine reason.

I've been trying to research the topic but most threads with quality answers involve negotiating salary at a company you already work at or don't really apply to my situation.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n    \nThis is the information that leads me to believe that I am worth more than what they are offering:\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n    \n1.

The salary level for my exact position, reported by over 100 people, ranges from 57k-78k with the median being 64k \n    (I have links for this but won't post them to keep the company anonymous here)\n5. This is not a small company\n6. I'm heavily involved in organizations in which I do software development, so just more valid relevant experience\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n   \nAfter doing research it's clear the leading cause of these conversations not going well is inexperience. I'd love to talk to the people face to face about this but they're in a different city. I don't know how I would approach writing all of this in an email without looking like a smartass that's throwing links at them about their own starting salaries reported by employees. A phone call would be ideal, but I don't know how to get to that. Like, am I supposed to email my recruiter and say \"hey can I call someone about my salary? I don't like it\".

            "selftext": "Hello all, \n\nI'm currently a senior studying Financial Economics. I have 22 credits of Computer Science and 20 credits of Mathematics outside of my degree requirements. I was initially a Computer Science minor but gave it up to pursue more math classes. \n\nThis past summer I did an internship with a bulge bracket bank doing investment team support on their private equity team. About halfway through my internship, I decided to apply for a full-time Investment Banking role within the same company, ultimately giving up any chance of a full time offer I had with my current team.\n\nAfter going through the interview process I ended up not getting it after the final round interviews. So I took a calculated risk and it didn't work out. Investment Banking would have been nice but I'm also avoiding years of 90 hour work weeks. I'm now at the beginning of my senior year and don't have a full time job locked down for after I graduate. \n\nI'm almost excited though. I've been thinking about pursuing research and a PhD for a long time now. Ever since being introduced to programming and statistics I've filled every moment I can trying to get better and learn more about the field. One thing I don't like is that it seems like when studying finance you're just a cow being herded into the slaughterhouse. There is so much focus on the logistical aspects (network, perfect your resume, land an internship...) that I didn't even know what I wanted to do in finance. I actually want to pursue research more so than finance (which won't benefit me monetarily speaking, I know.)\n\nSo I need advice on my profile here. I'm not aiming for the top school, but I want to go some place where I can be a valuable asset. I have two big weaknesses working against me. \n\n1. I have a not-so-fabulous CUM. GPA (3.1)\n2. I do not have the core math classes (Calc I, Calc II, Calc III)\n\nI know those are issues that are hard to rectify. I have been able to convince other professors to let me into math courses without the calc requirements and have gotten A's in those courses. My last 60 credits GPA is *3.6* and I have received A's in all my CS courses. \n\nThings I might have working for me:\n\n1. Brand Name Internship\n2. RA for Economics Professor\n3. TA for brand new Data Science Class\n4. Manage R tutoring lab\n5. Involved in leadership in several campus clubs\n\nI'm hoping I can get some insight on what level program I should shoot for. I'm currently studying for the GRE and have a few solid letters of recommendation lined up with professors I've done research for and TA'd for. \n\nIs aiming high for Purdue, mid-level for University of Utah, or low-level for Washington State University realistic?\n\n\n",

I would sincerely appreciate some perspective and any advice other experienced devs might be willing share. \n\nThe job: My coworkers are great, I work remotely, and my salary is around ~$65k. We take on everything web related: cms/websites, full-stack web applications, data visualizations, and native mobile apps. I like the company but its size is starting to impact my professional development. Projects are almost always rushed, last minute, and poorly managed. Condensed timelines mean I work 10-12 hour days. I'm almost always on projects by myself juggling discovery, scoping/spec'ing, client interaction, development, and the majority of the project management and documentation. Basically, anything that's not scheduling or sales related, I do. If I do get a chance to share a project with a contractor or other employee, I'm usually leading the project. Not sharing this to boost my ego, just illustrating responsibilities. I'm starting to burn out and the isolated nature of the company is only limiting my growth as an engineer.\n\nMe: I'm in my early thirties and came into web development from a design background. I majored in graphic design in college but always gravitated toward development and technology. I've had a number of development jobs; from major universities, small e-commerce retailers, to a startup where I helped launch a product from scratch.\n\nAbilities: I focus mainly on front-end technology but contribute to the entire stack of most projects and lead architectural decisions. I work primarily in javascript and PHP, jumping in and out of frameworks to suit project requirements. Currently working with Yii and Laravel on the backend, and Angular, React, and Vue.js on the frontend. Would love to do more with javascript on the server side and adopt new languages in general. I would say I'm a generalist but the UI layer is my jam and where I want to focus as a front-end dev.\n\nI want to move on from my small agency to a larger organization where I can grow as an engineer. I want more challenges, to be better at what I do, and to have more opportunities to learn from better and more experienced developers. I'd love to work on larger platforms and am eyeing front-end positions at Google and other large companies.\n\nMy question: How should I approach changing up my development career? Is it even feasible without a CS-degree? I lack the algorithmic background and formal CS education that this sub seems to stress. Will I be out of my element applying to a software engineering positions at a place like Google? I fear that if I don't move on from my current environment I'll end up stuck doing hack work, stagnating, and abandoning development all-together. Basically, where can I go from here?\n\nTLDR; Experience dev feels stuck and wants to find new employment, but lacks a CS background. As a generalist, will I have any chance applying to an organization like Google? It's challenging to gauge my abilities and skill level when I'm not regularly working alongside others, sort of feels as if I'm wandering out of the wilderness back into society.",

Or at least get some feedback from other managers.  \n  \n   So I am in a weird situation looking for some advice. I graduated 9 months ago and returned to the company that I was an intern at.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n  \n   I have a manager who is pretty much fits the textbook definition for a great manager. Ive also done well adjusting the industry. All is well.  \n  \n   The past couple month I determined I was going to attempt to really start off strong in my career. I made a list of technologies and skills that I was weak at. Most days after work I\u2019ve been trying to put some time in on one of the items on the list.  \n\n   Im fairly sure I would like to be a manager one day down the road. So I have been also taking specific note of the planning aspects and soft skills that work well.  \n  \n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n  \n   Without going into specifics, the past couple of months I\u2019ve started noticing reoccurring problems planning for projects. I realize this has been an issue in all fields for pretty much all of time, so its not a specific bash on my team (they\u2019re awesome).  \n\n   About a month ago I was reading a book that went into psychology of decision making/planning and read some really enlightening stuff. This got my mind working at how this could be incorporated into our team by writing a tool to utilize this research. At first I considered raising the idea to my manager for consideration. Then I realized how much of a problem planning is in so many fields and didn\u2019t necessarily want to waste my idea and implementation for one team on one company.  \n\n   So I decided to start planning out a personal project to help planning that could be used in general cases. I think it has big potential to be effective at improving a widespread and long-lasting issue . Call my greedy, but possibility of implementing it and it generating a user base got me motivated. I realize the huge success of an tool/app nowadays is a pretty farfetched so thats not what I\u2019m banking on in any way. Worst case scenario, I learn some new stuff and get a sweet side project for my resume.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n  \n   This is where it gets tricky. If I successfully completed the project and was happy with the end product, I was leaning towards floating it by my manager for use on our team. After all, the whole thing was motivated by a nagging issue on our team. I also could see our PM and scrum master loving the idea. If that issue continued on it would be awesome to see it be used and tested in a real working environment. But I wanted to tread carefully because I feel like the whole situation is a little awkward to a third party.  \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n  \n   A kind of \u201cHey I saw an issue on our team and thought of potentially awesome solution. But then I realized I wanted the glory for myself so I made it secretly in my spare time. Anyway, its done and maybe we could use it, but its still totally my own project.\u201d  \n\n   Also I\u2019m aware that there is a kind of a conflict of interests in using an external tool on a team, but having the tool belonging to a team member.  \n\n   I started the project. I had made some good progress on it. Everything was looking good.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n  \n  \n   Then recently in one of our sprint retro meetings the exact problem my project is meant to address came up in discussion. The team started discussing ways to address the problem. While I was sitting there thinking \u201cI already have thought of this a shitload, have my potential solutions, but I can\u2019t really say because I\u2019m secretly working on a project to fix this in my own time.\u201d  \n\n   The team went on to discuss possible actions that could help. They trended very close to manually doing what my project is intended to make easy. Everyone in the meeting agreed it was a problem and my manager even remarked that our PM would love something like this.  \n\n   Now that we had discussed solutions that are somewhat close to what my project does it puts me in a REALLY weird spot.\nI was in the middle of secretly making something that everyone agreed would help our team and please our managers.  \n\n* I really didn\u2019t want to get stuck being tasked with \u201csolving\" a problem that I already felt I had a great solution to. Which either leads to me duplicating my own side work for our company or playing ignorant and wasting time on something I felt I had a better solution for.  \n\n* If I wait and continue making the side project without telling anyone, it will look like I stole our teams ideas and decided to make my own personal project to benefit myself rather than help at work.  \n\n* If I tell my manager about what I\u2019m working on, it could potentially save the team time/resources to use as an external tool. But it also raises the awkward conflict of interest problem. And it also looks like I identified a problem in our team, came up with ways to approach it, but decided to use it for my own personal gain instead of proposing it to the team from the start. Which I admit, is pretty much what I did.  \n\n\n&nbsp;  \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n  \n  \n   After the retro ended I was a little rattled and ultimately decided its probably best to tell my manager one on one about the situation now. I didn\u2019t see any better outcome if I was to wait.  My manager said he was willing to hear my pitch.\n\n  During the meeting I explained how I noticed the problem, came across some interesting ideas while reading, decided the tool had widespread potential, and didn\u2019t want my idea to be limited to my work team. I told him the research behind my idea and the functionality of my tool. I floated the idea that when its done and polished it had potential to be useful as an external tool, but if not, thats cool too.  \n\n   He commented that it was interesting and he thought the PM would like the idea. He didn\u2019t give a clear answer on ever using it (obviously, that depends a final product among many other things). But he also didn\u2019t say we WOULDNT use it. He did say I should keep it to myself though, which I agree.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n \n  After this point, I decided that I should probably get this thing done asap if I want an actual chance at it being used. The longer it isn\u2019t completed the chances of its use pretty much evaporate. I also decided that if it was going to get any consideration it had to super easy to use and damn near perfect.  \n\n   Its been a week since that meeting and nothing has been brought up about addressing the planning problems. Although I know for a fact it will happen next retro in a week or so. Since then Ive put a lot of time into the project. It is actually shaping up really really well and is looking even better than I imagined from the start.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n   \n  \n   So this is where I\u2019m at now. This is probably the best work ever done and the tool is looking awesome for actual industry use. But I also realize the weirdness of this situation and realize its probably a pipe dream. At the minimum, Ill have a super awesome personal project for my resume and learned a bunch completing it.  \n\n   I feel somewhat bad about the whole situation. But, at the same time it was a problem I noticed and thought about in my own time. Researched on my own time. And because I felt I had a potentially great idea, a project that I\u2019ve only worked on in my own time.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n   Has anyone ever been in this situation? Am I digging myself a hole here? Does this make me look terrible in the eyes of my manager? Do I abandon this ship? Thoughts/opinions on how I should move forward are super appreciated. Im trying to tread very carefully here. Thanks.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n&nbsp;\n  \n  \n  \ntl;dr \n  \n  \n* Noticed a problem on my team that is universal in many workplaces. \n* Outside of work, researched and thought of solution to address this problem. \n* Instead of presenting my idea to my team I decided my idea has a lot of potential in many fields/companies.\n* I secretly start implementing it as a personal project and considering floating its use a external tool at work when I\u2019m done. \n* Midway through my project, my team at work starts to address the issue I researched.

            "selftext": "I'm a software engineer and I know I'm not very good - probably around average, at best. I'm new at my company and I was really worried that I wasn't getting up to speed fast enough. Another guy who is new in my team (he came the same week as me) but not new to the company got a really huge and difficult task, and completed it really quickly. I didn't finish my task as fast as him and my task is really simple too.\n\nI told my manager that I was worried I wasn't learning fast enough, and he told me I was doing fine. But it was pretty obvious that I wasn't contributing much compared to everyone else.\n\nThe other new guy was integrating a really old system with a LOT of byzantine code with a new system (which I was working on), so not only did he learn the old system and the new system well enough to integrate them, but he completed the integration in a month.\n\nEveryone else is constantly adding new features or fixing reported bugs, and they have something new to say every morning at the scrum meeting.\n\nI was just learning the company's internal systems for two weeks and doing nothing productive until I got my first task. I was supposed to implement a small backend web service (really just a single feature) from database to RESTful API, including a full test suite, and it took me two and a half weeks to do it. Which is a really long time, at least compared to what I did at school. I did do it in a language that I never used before, but if we're being real here it doesn't take a lot to learn a new language. Every day, my scrum update was the same thing, saying I am working on the same service as I did for the past two weeks.\n\nSo then earlier this week, I was told I won an award for being quick to complete my tasks and that apparently the estimated time for completion was two to three months. I really have a hard time believing that and I'm pretty sure I got the award because I told my manager about my worries, and he felt bad for me.\n\nNow I have this award, which was announced to everyone working on the system I'm working on (not just my immediate team), and other people who don't know that I'm not anything special as a programmer probably expect things from me which I can't deliver. I feel really horrible, and I feel like I got this award because my manager pities me. I shouldn't have gotten this award, and now I feel even worse for being so slow and looking so weak that I got a pity award. Other people that got awards actually did really good, important work, and I didn't really do anything except make people feel bad for me. I feel like I am devaluing the award for the other people.\n\nI don't know what I am supposed to do. If I tell my manager about how I feel, then he will feel even more sorry for me and I don't want that to happen. I also don't want to seem ungrateful or rude. But I feel really stressed now because other people probably think I am better than I am, but I didn't actually do the work I needed to do to deserve an award. I don't want to get awards unless I actually deserve them. What am I supposed to do? What do I tell other people if they come to me and expect something to be done faster than I can do it because of this award?",

Then I got an offer a day later.\n\nThe salary is on par with what you would find at a Big 4 tech company, but if you were FTE. No benefits for this role, as expected. I currently live on the other side of the US, so this would be a huge relocation and I'm not particularly excited about the project itself.\n\nIf anything, the salary is what's forcing me to consider this opportunity and it seems like a good way to get my foot in the door as someone w/o a ton of software engineering experience.

My GPA is decent (3.6) albeit not great, I have projects/demo's in iOS/Swift, Android, Java and Web (node.js, express, mysql, etc.), and a small internship at a not so well-known place, but am having a hard time getting even interviews.\n\nMy project/thesis was based on me doing an iOS app, and I think I did a pretty cool one, and even load tested it...It's definitely the \"gem\" of my portfolio. The problem is that my thesis chair was kind of a tyrant/asshole, and honestly it soured me on iOS development, and got me to want to look into other areas of software engineering. Regarding what I mean by general software engineering, I'm interested in working with API's and integrating them into apps (i.e. weather/finance, etc.), working on backend stuff, databases, working with Amazon Web Services, etc.\n\nSo, I'm debating if I should just put all of my eggs in the iOS development basket, and try to get a job there. If I do, I may be interested in other software engineering positions in the future. With taht said, perhaps being with a good company/team, would make me happy. Regardless, not having a job kind of sucks, especially when you thought you would have no problem finding one with a degree that seems so in demand, and also because the bank account funds won't last for too much longer.",

One is the college route and takes about 6 years, pretty dry cut and simple. The other route is one that a friend of mine is taking and suggests that I do the same and that is studying to get a lot of certs (A+, CCNA, MCSA, CEH) and then start in the IT field (call center and then work my way up). Eventually, my goal is to make around 50$/hr although would be willing to settle for a little less. Do you know if going the cert route is a viable option?

Anyways, I started out my CS journey really half-assed and got no internships or opportunities or anything, had like a 3.1 GPA.\n\nStarting around the beginning of my Junior year I began doing extracurricular activities and making my own projects. I also started studying my ass off and after I puled an A in my algorithms analysis course, one of my professors accepted me into undergraduate research after me asking him for something to do. \n\nI'm applying to graduate school for an MS and am really confident that I can get into my school's program with a Teaching Assistantship as well as being able to continue doing research. \n\nLong story short, I went to my schools recent engineering fair with a beefed up resume looking for a summer internship to fill the gap between undergrad and grad school -  and it was a totally different environment than I was used to my first 3 years with a shit resume: Employers were more than excited to meet me. Some (no names but mostly large banking companies) even asked me if I'd be willing to forgo grad school if they gave me a decent offer after the inernship.\n\nI could even sense that telling some employers my plans for grad school actually turned them off for giving me a summer internship simply because I am so close to finishing undergraduate that they'd prefer to just immediately hire me.\n\nI feel like had I had the same resume back in my junior or sophomore year it wouldn't be so complicated, but such is the price I pay for slacking I suppose.\n\nAm I fucking myself by doing grad school rather than jumping straight into work? Should I actually consider quitting grad school, will that not gimp my education? \nI guess basically the question is if you think I will actually learn more in Grad School at a top-50 level state university or just working at a large company?\n\nI'm just afraid taking some high starting salary role at a large banking company will land me a job maintaining uninteresting code (or worse, not coding at all) and doing hardly anything innovative, I'm going to grad school specifically because I want to be on the most cutting-edge side of technology and computer science.

I went into the major because I knew that I enjoyed business, but I also wanted more of a technical background before getting my MBA. I could see myself completing my degree, but I am not passionate about the courses. I am not keen on working in the field after graduation, I would rather work in software. I could try to get a CS minor, but the courses are so over-saturated here that I might have difficulty getting into them as a non-major. \n\nSoftware is a lot more innovative and interesting to me, and I would rather work in this field than work as an Industrial Engineer after graduation. I enjoy math, but I would prefer to work in applied math rather than data analytics and such. \n\nMy GPA is below a 3.5, so I will not be able to transfer into CS or Computer Engineering at UIUC, so I have a few options. \n1) I can either keep studying Industrial Engineering at UIUC and try to get a CS minor.\n2) I can keep studying Industrial Engineering at UIUC and I can join a CS boot-camp, or self-teach myself some key concepts.\n3) I can transfer to the University of Illinois at Chicago to pursue CS. \n\n\nUIC\u2019s CS program is far from U of I\u2019s, but it is certainly not bad. It isn\u2019t known out of the Chicago area, which is unfortunate, because I want to move to the Bay Area after graduation, but I think that with enough side projects and performing well in my courses, I might be able to find a decent job in the Bay Area. \n\nDo you think it would be hard for me to get into the field as an Industrial Engineering major? After reading online, my perception is that a minor will not help me much in the field, but I don\u2019t really understand this. If I can take the key courses such as Data Structures, Algorithms, Databases etc., will this not be sufficient for me to be able to find a well-paying job? \n\nIs my reasoning correct? Will I have a shot at moving to the Bay Area from Chicago, if I have enough side projects and internships to supplement my resume, or will I have to work in Chicago for a few years and then try to move? \n\n\n\n",

My question is how do I answer the \"did you receive a return offer\" question or defer from answering it?

            "selftext": "So, I've been on my current team for about coming up on a year, and one issue that I've, and others, have run into (and this is something that I've seen when I was previously interning), is that the code review process is often quite slow.  For instance, in the best case, I may push out a CR, wait a day or so to get feedback, IMMEDIATELY fixed the feedback, and then wait another couple of days for approval.  I recognize that everyone is busy (and there are lots of people trying to get their code reviewed), but this is seriously impacting people's work efficiency.  Some things that I've tried are calling out for help during standup, making my code reviews smaller, asking people to specifically look at my CR, talking to my manager, and so on, but none of these have led to longer term, impactful changes.\n\nWhat I'm more wondering is if you know of any good systems to incorporate code reviews more effectively into a team's daily practice.  Does your team do something cool with code reviews?  Do you have a designated code reviewer?  Do you have the oncall person focus on CRs?  Is there a designated time everyday to look at CRs?  Are CRs going to be a roadblock for the rest of my life?  I'm trying to think of a practice or system that can be adopted by a team to make this process smoother.\n\nThanks! ",

I'm quite interesting in AI, and think I'd want to explore AI in the future\n\nI think about starting to study next year. In order to prepare for the big plan of working full-time and studying full-time, I'll need to plan my schedule carefully, so I'd like to ask you experienced fellow some questions: \n\n- Have you done it before? How is it like to work and study full-time simultaneously? Did you get burned out? How did you deal with it?\n\n- I'm living in Montreal, so I'm considering CS degree from McGill or Concordia. From their website, the degree requires ~4 years of full-time study. How busy is it studying here? Do you have to be available at the university most days of the week? Do they offer evening class sometime? This is important because it would affect work schedule\n\n- Maintaining full-time work and full-time study simultaneously is very hard, which requires a lot of planning, and discipline. So I'm training myself: \n  + Practicing time management, planning my current work, and my current life ahead, and try to stick to the plan\n  + Reading strategy (and taking note): improving reading speed can speed up study time. I'm also practicing a reading plan, 15 pages per day. \n  + Reading ahead: fortunately, this is the era where study resource is not extremely hard to find. I can start reading books required by the university from now so that when I start studying, it takes me less time to read and to understand\n\nWhat else can I do to prepare ahead? Any tips studying?\n\nThank you for your time,\n----\nEdit: with current career, I don't have to look for work at this moment. But I'd want to challenge myself to work at a Big 4. And I think getting a CS degree would help me open a door to a Big 4. \n",

            "selftext": "Just today I had an interview for a software developer intern position, and my nerves definitely got the best of me. I was given a technical question that I was pretty much certain was to be solved using recursion and dynamic programming, but for the first 20 minutes of the 40 minute interview, I stumbled around trying to grasp the exact solution. My concern is that I don't think I was very clear in expressing my thoughts for these first 20 minutes. Initially, I stated that it looked like it was a recursive problem, the general idea of my approach, and how I could probably optimize it through dynamic programming. However, I didn't really expand too much on these ideas - I was sort of panicking because I felt like the optimal DP solution was right in front of me but I couldn't quite get it. I think I basically repeated these same few lines over and over again as I sat there trying to put the pieces together. Finally, though, after the 20 minutes, I got the solution (which I think was quite optimal), and was able to code it. I had a few careless mistakes here and there that I fixed up along the way, but for the most part, I think I did it rather smoothly and explained it clearly. At the end, much to my relief, the interviewer said my solution looked great. However, now that I'm thinking about it afterwards, I'm quite concerned about my lack of clarity and direction in the first half of the interview. Do you think I would still have good chances if I solved the interview problem, despite this initial blunder? And another side concern - do you think this one DP problem is enough for a 40 minute interview, or was I maybe too slow for him to give me another question?",

The programming questions were inbetween the video responses, and the following video response required to talk about the preceding programming problem; however I did not manage to find a solution for one of the problems. Thankfully I completed the third one and was able to discuss it for the video question but I am extremely nervous about not passing one of the questions. \n\nLong story short I pursued a very elaborate solution that would account for all cases in O(logn) time but realized towards the end there was no way I was going to be able to implement this completely -- so I commented out that code and tried a smaller, simpler solution but failed. I understand the emphasis of these HireVue recruiting techniques is on behavioral questions but do you think this will automatically disqualify me from the selection pool?

It's 4 people, with two software engineers. I'm fairly confident I would get to touch cool stuff and really get to try my hand at some real development tasks but I'm nervous that as my last internship it is a little risky because I don't know if they will be around by the time I graduate and I'm not sure how difficult it will be to get my second job if the startup were to go under while I was working there as a new grad.   \n\nCurrently I'm in the interview pipeline with a few firms, but none of them are \"Big N\" or companies I'm extra excited about.  If it counts for anything, I am excited about the technology the startup is trying to develop and I could see myself \"drinking the kool-aid\".  Would I be making a mistake by passing up on this opportunity to intern at a non technical fortune 500 company for the 3rd time? How would you guys try and evaluate this startup to gauge whether it's a solid opportunity or not?  What questions should I ask the founders and what signs should I be looking for (both good and bad)?",

            "selftext": "Hello all,\n\nI am currently interviewing for jobs in my area and had a positive interview that garnered some interest from a longstanding successful company. They seem to be offering a salary comparable to what someone with my level of experience as a software developer should expect (~4 years).\n\nThe issue is that this office has transitioned all new development to using a No Code (or Low Code) platform. They claim that what once took their team of .NET developers a month or more to put together, can be put together within a couple of days to a week with the same standard of quality. They have a large existing .NET code base that they need help maintaining and converting over to the No Code platform, so there would be some maintenance in .NET, just no new development.\n\nThe position would require much more in the way of soft skills, requirement gathering and talking to clients, which I have no problem with. It would also require some big picture thinking about a given problem set and sussing out process inefficiencies.\n\nIt makes sense that a large chunk of the industry (particular enterprise applications) would move in this direction eventually. Many companies are working on automating software development through various means such as AI and further code abstraction. Even doing some googling, I found quite a few articles talking about how this could disrupt the whole market soon. https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonbloomberg/2017/07/20/the-low-codeno-code-movement-more-disruptive-than-you-realize/#294e0f6722a3\n\nI still feel uncertain if that transition will actually happen anytime soon though. I know that there were \"No Code\" solutions in the past (MS Access) , that promised the moon and didn't quite deliver. I have had first hand knowledge with some of these because I have rewritten legacy apps that were originally put together in those environments.\n\nI am also worried because using No Code solutions ties you to a specific platform and vendor in a more limiting way than how a tech stack can tie you down. I don't want to take a position using one platform only for it to be useless on the market later on and hurt me career wise. I've also heard lots of devs look down on devs who use No Code platforms and I don't want it to be a ding on my resume if I decide I want to transition back.\n\nThe platform in question doesn't have much in the way of documentation outside of marketing materials, so its impossible for me to do much technical research on how exactly the platform works or what it looks like. It seems the company keeps a pretty tight leash on their clients via their contract.\n\nI am wondering if anyone else out there has made a transition to using something like this and how they feel about their career choice or their company's choice? Do you regret not sticking with a 3rd Gen Language?\n",

This is my first job out of college and I'm two years in and have been treated so horribly that I regularly wake up crying or short of breath and have developed a pretty intense depression. Basically I am 100% travel (was promised <50% at hiring), and am regularly given assignments so far out of my designated region that I'm traveling 20+ hours a week (unpaid, untracked) on top of the 50 hour standard workload expected of me.\n\nI've had very little opportunity to develop professional relationships during my time here as I never work with the same people for more than two or rarely three weeks. I've regularly been among the company's top performers, every single quarter being featured in our internal customer satisfaction reviews. But I've had four managers in two years, and only spoken to one of them so sadly I don't think I'm getting a good reference despite the good performance (I've tried to contact the others at various times but they're extremely unresponsive).\n\nThankfully I've found a position locally that I'm very excited about and they've made me a solid offer. Problem is, I'm scheduled for a one month assignment in two weeks but I want to put in my two weeks notice as soon as possible. Is that going to be something I regret in a few years when I'm asked \"may we contact your previous employer?\" I've been treated so poorly that I really think giving a polite two weeks notice is more than fair but I think they're going to ask me to see out one last assignment. I *really* don't think my mental health can take another month with no free time but if it saves my ass two years down the line I might be able to suck it up. But since I don't think I'll be getting a good reference anyways.. Advice?",

You have to take certain entry level classes and then must be approved by both colleges.

And I'm less than two months from completing my university degree. \n\n\nI am interviewing today for a CRM Developer role at smallish start up.\n\n\nMy expected starting range is 45k - 55k NZD. 45k seems to be standard. This position starts at 40k. For comparison this is less than what I would earn if I worked full time in my current Customer Service Role and the same as I earned doing Data Entry in an insurance company before I quit to study CS.\n\n\nObviously they will have to impress me in the interview, but it would mean I can start a Developer role the day after uni finishes and I need to get real world experience.\n\n\nWhat would make you take the job? What would you ask or ask for? Obviously if they offer it to me I will try to negotiate up. \n\n\nWould you stay at a part time non-technical position while looking for better opportunities, take the role and get X time for experience before moving on, or take the role and keep applying for other jobs (potentially quitting within weeks or months)?\n\nEdit: for additional context my skill match pretty well (though I would have to learn PHP) and I only applied for the role less than 48 hours ago (so they may be keen),.

Then I clarified that even though Python is not statically typed the runtime implicitly assigns types to objects, and throws type errors if something doesn't match. He insisted that Python is definitely not strongly typed, then moved on to the next question.\n\nIs there any way I could have handled this gracefully?

            "selftext": "TL; DR: I recently joined a medium sized startup 50 total employees, as a junior developer and have after 6 weeks been fired today, I\u2019m wondering if I\u2019m cut out for programming of if I should go back to what I know. \n\nBit of background:\nI\u2019m 30 and after a year of teaching myself to program I had multiple job offers and I settled on this company because from the interview experience it seemed like a great place to work. \n\nHowever when I joined I realised this wasn\u2019t really a tech company like they sold it to me as. There was 5 developers total, 2 were java devs working on a completely different product and then there was my team which comprised of a lead dev and another junior who had joined 6 months ago, but had 3 years of programming experience as a developer in a multitude of different companies. \n\nDuring the interview I was completely honest about my abilities. I told them I was self taught. Had multiple projects that I was passionately working on. I didn\u2019t lie about not having used the frameworks and libraries they asked me about, and even was honest about never having used most of the technologies they were using in their code base. I was reassured they\u2019d support me and I could learn it all no problem. I was highly commended for completing the tech test with little to no experience on the task. \n\nThe first few weeks were rough I felt like I had no idea what was going on and perhaps I wasn\u2019t ready to become a developer. I was writing scripts for the first few weeks and making some mistakes which weren\u2019t flagged up with me, none of my code was reviewed, it was even pushed to production without being reviewed, some of it was reviewed by the other junior dev but he didn\u2019t pick up on some of the mistakes I made, and I wasn\u2019t aware they were mistakes because it wasn\u2019t flagged so made these small errors over and over on other similar scripts. And occasionally the lead dev would look at a bit of code I\u2019d written and say I\u2019ve made an error there, but I\u2019d done it before and it wasn\u2019t raised as an issue. Regardless of which I persevered and was starting to feel quite confident.\n\nBut that\u2019s where some of the major issues started. They didn\u2019t have any development methodology in place, so I kept having to ask the lead dev for things to do, and most of the time he\u2019d fob me off and say he\u2019ll find me something to work on and then not get back to me at all, so I spent days with literally nothing to work on. \n\nEven though I had nothing to do I tried to be productive researching and learning things I didn\u2019t know, I read through the extensive code base tried to understand what was going on. But this week when I came into work today I was just told they\u2019d have to let me go, because \u201cit wasn\u2019t working out\u201d that was the only reason I was given, and reassured it had nothing to do with ability. \n\nBut I\u2019m doubting whether I should go and look for another junior dev role, or go back to what I know, I had a miserable experience, completely on my own, no mentoring, no peer programming, most of the time with nothing to actually do. I was stressed the entire time, working up the courage to resign everyday on the tram into work, or wondering if today would be the day I get fired. The thing is I love programming, I find it rewarding, and I relished everything I worked on whilst I was there, yes I was slow and it took me a lot of time to get things done but when I did that feeling was magic. \n\nIt\u2019s worth noting other than me and the other junior dev they\u2019ve never hired juniors before. And maybe that was the issue. Me and the other junior were assigned tasks together and he was a lot more experienced than me, and in certain areas far more knowledgeable than the lead dev. So when we were assigned tasks before I\u2019d even started designing how to tackle the task the other junior would have already completed the task. Leaving me with nothing to do. \n\nSorry if this is rambling on. I\u2019m just confused and don\u2019t know what to do. I think this experience has put me off wanting to be a programmer. Any and all advice would be appreciated. ",

Obviously every company is different, so finding the proper balance between roles has been challenging. \n\nIn my previous position as a tech lead, my main role was working on complex technical issues, developing architectural changes, and mentoring / assisting junior developers. My dev manager was responsible for determining priority of tickets and assigning them to developers to work on during the start of a sprint. Previously, we were also allocating all tickets at the start of a sprint, as opposed to having a big To Do pile for developers to pick items up as they had capacity.\n\nIn my new position as the dev manager of my team, my tech lead feels that since he already knows the team and the project, he should be the one assigning out tickets and determining the order in which they are completed.\n\nSince this is a departure from my previous experiences, I am curious if this is a familiar org structure, and what you consider the actual role of the dev manager in this kind of situation.\n\nEdit: To further complicate this, we also have a full time Project Manager that is helping to determine priority of upcoming features, helping to get clarification on acceptance criteria, and is also serving a bit in the capacity as a ScrumMaster.

            "selftext": "The start of my career has been a bit frustrating, so i just wanted to share some of my experiences here.\n\nI got my BSc degree last year while I started working part-time for a small software company (~10 employees). I'm from Finland.\n\nThe interview seemed quite promising, I was told they did code reviews and all that kind of stuff. The situation quickly proved to be quite the opposite. Nobody there had a proper CS education, and the \"senior\" devs were ignorant about the most basic things.\n\nI had to deal with methods of 200+ lines, and new \"fancy\" design patterns being introduced weekly just causing a bigger mess.\n\nThe security was also a joke. The production instance running as root, and its global admin account had a 7-letter lowercase password that everyone at the company knew. I also found numerous other security flaws that nobody cared about fixing.\n\nThe management was non-technical, which was mostly the cause for the issues. The developers were put on an insane workload, having complete features that were promised to customers in just a few weeks. No time was given for proper testing, and the management was basically fine with shipping possibly broken software, which happened all the time.\n\nI got to work on some interesting things there, but I felt that my values didn't match with company's, so I left in under a year.\n\nI found a new job in a larger company (~100 employees) in which I'm still working at. It started out nicely. There were proper development processes place and security is on a whole other level. I still had to deal with some messy code, but it wasn't too bad.\n\nI've still had to deal with some annoyances. Like people struggling with git, and not putting effort into learning it, since it's \"a waste of time\"... And just finding some people hard to communicate with.\n\nUnfortunately, most of my team including the most talented devs left the company within a few months, so things have gotten a bit harder. I'm now in a team of a few student developers building a \"world class\" product. It's not so easy when the lead dev is gone and we have to \"get back on our feet\" again.\n\nIt seems like there is a real deficiency of skilled developers, and I feel I could basically get a job at almost any software company. I regret I didn't go work for some more well known IT company, thinking that I may have gotten to work with some more talented people.\n\nI'm thinking of switching jobs again soon, if the situation at my current company doesn't improve. Maybe go working abroad or something. I'm still studying for my Master's degree, but the courses have been quite boring. I feel like I can't get much more out of studying if I don't specialize in something like AI or big data (currently just studying Software engineering).\n\nSo my questions are:\n\n* Have you been in a similar situation?\n* Is it common having to deal with messy code?\n* How do you deal with less skilled people?\n* Where should I head next?",

            "selftext": "Hello all!\n\nI wanted to reach out to Reddit for advice on a job decision I have to make this week! I am a 27 year old Software Engineer (No dependents, will be engaged soon) and passionate about Blockchain development.  I have an entrepreneurial attitude and am hoping to start various blockchain ventures or other business ventures around technology in the future (Such as start a consultancy firm with developers under me).  I prefer to work from home as from experience I think working in a corporate office in cubicles is a life-drain and really wears me down emotionally/mentally.\n\n-------------------------------------\n\nI am currently working for a Fortune 100 company in the Entertainment Business.  I am W2 and make $55 per hour (approx: $100,000 per year as I have no vacation, and only 3 sick days a year), only benefit is health/dental which I pay $300 a month for myself.\n\n**I have 2 job offers on the table:**\n\n***** 1.) Work for a start-up blockchain company.  They are brand new, very small, I will be a blockchain developer and general developer.  My responsbilities include ensureing the companies success technologically.  (Developing their main product/application, working on and making their website nice, work on Ethereum smart contracts and work on a private blockchain called Multichain)\n\n**Compensation:** \n\n- 1099 - $80 per hour\n- plus 1 BTC a month. \n- 32 hours a week for the time being... \n- (I also have the option to receive 100,000 shares of stock, I really dont know much about the stock options, and I know it could be 'vapor' if the company doesnt take off)\n\n**Pros:**\n\n- Work in interesting technology\n- I am bootstraping the company, so i can build the technology using my methods and standards, more freedom development wise\n- Opportunity to establish myself as a niche' blockchain developer and create a name for myself in that field \n- Remote, work from home 100%\n\n**Cons:**\n\n- Company is very small, but seeking venture capitalist money.  \n- I feel like if I dont deliver software wise, the company will go under without my technical contributions\n- Only me and 1 other developer is working there, most of the weight will be on my shoulders\n- They raised 1.5mm in ICO, and are seeking outside funding from VC firms\n\n\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n\n\n\n\n***** 2.) Work for another Fortune 100 company.  I would be working in office for 1-3 months, and slowly will begin to work remotely for the company as I prove my competence to them.\n\n**Compensation:**\n\n- 1099 - $85 per hour\n- W2 - $10 per hour\n- Total: $95 per hour, no benefits.\n\n\n**Pros:**\n\n- Working for a secure stable company, can easily work there for 3+ years without fear of losing my job\n- Option to work remote 3+ days a week as I prove myself\n- Looks good on my resume as this is now the second Fortune 100 Entertainment company I have worked for\n\n**Cons:**\n\n- I will work in a cubicle and I struggle with that, I get depressed doing so day after day, week after week of that environment\n- I find corporate development boring, and its not exciting\n- I dont care that I work for an entertainment company, I just want to bring home the most money as possible.\n- Not remote at first.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nUltimately, my goal as a developer is to bring home as money as possible in my future.  I want to pick a path that will allow me to do that.  To bring home real money, IMO you have to be some sort of business owner (Own a consultancy firm, start some tech companies, etc), otherwise your just a wage-slave and only make money when you are putting in hours.\n\n--------------------\n\nI feel like I have 2 good options on the table, and cant go wrong either way. I feel that my decision here will be a turning point in my career. \n------------------------------------\n\n I am also young and naive,and I would love to know what more experienced people would choose and if you have any tips to offer!\n---------------------------------------------\n\nThanks!",

There was only one programming question( implement tasks execution scheduling, given that you can only use one timer).\n\nI had an idea how to solve it pretty much on the spot, interviwer said it sounds good and left me alone for some time to solve it(write real code). I got the general idea right, but my code didnt do what it should(largly due to me miss understanding something in the problem statement). He gave me some more time, I told him my idea for solving it, which was good, but still, couldnt finish the task in time.\n\nHow bad does that sound? I know they care more about how you think than actually finishing up, but still it was the only serious question in the whole interview. It seemed to me like the interviewer did not want the interview to go any longer than planned, which have me worried.",

The questions range from 'where do I find the docs for this' to 'how do I start working on this story' to 'I have a bug, can you help fix it?' and it is really starting to frustrate me, because I lose my own time helping them. These are not one-off questions, but regular daily things, such that I feel like I should even receive credit for their work sometimes.\n\nThis has happened at my previous job too. Thanks to this, I ended up being assigned as Scrum Master (good) but after some time, my manager told me to stop 'spoon feeding' colleagues. Yet I have no idea how. \n\n\nI'm not even Scrum Master at this new job and I'm already starting to feel similar pressure, coming home frustrated, and staying longer hours just because I spent a cumulative 1-2 hours helping other people over and above my meetings with them.\n\n\nSince it has happened at both jobs, I've concluded that I'm the problem and that I need to change my behavior.\n\nMoreover, I'm only 3 years into my career and the other developers usually have double the work experience I do.

I can see myself in this industry long term. \n\nI have a degree in Accounting which I make no use of, nor do I wanna do accounting. I feel like I wasted 4 years in college doing something I didn't want to do. I could have done CS but I don't know why I didn't. All I know is that I want to do it now. Better late than never. \n\nGoing back to school would be a difficult choice for me. As I work full time, 45-60 hours a week. There are days I have to stay late, which is a problem if I have a night class. So I'm trying to avoid going back to school for that reason. I cannot afford to work part time and cut my salary in half. Also at the rate I take classes, I may not get a degree in CS within 3-4 years.\n\nI am all for doing certification courses, or learning on my own during my free time.

I just wanna make sure I make the best of my time, and learn what is needed to learn. Any videos, books, online courses would be good. \n\nI understand I'm going to have to create small projects to build my portfolio. What would be the best way to approach this? Should I start (continue) learning Java and try to build small programs? Learn Swift to develop iOS apps/games? Or take some courses (FreeCodeCamp) to learn web development?\n\nI'm just lost right now and need some guidance that would put me on a path to leaving my current position, learn to code, and enter the CS industry.

The only advantages I can *potentially* squeeze out of my current job seems to be that I am already familiar with the corporate environment and I can bring marketing skills to a team (which might not be common in many CS grads).

I took a couple of CS classes during my math degree. I wasn't very serious about starting a career so I did a few odd jobs at first.\n\nI've been working in a sector of financial services for about 10 years. I started in sales for about 4 years. I then got a reports analyst job, where I had to learn excel/vba/sql entirely on my own. After just 1 year I had earned the respect of the actual developers there and we could speak about technical issues without any problem. I did some programming, using the excel/vba/sql stack and developed very useful macros. I tried to program those according to the good principles of modularity, avoidance of side effects, etc.\n\nMy current position is that of a functional and business analyst.\nI gather client requirements and I program them in this huge software that runs the company operations. It is very close to programming in that I create the equivalent of functions, combine them, etc. This is done through a weird interface made for non programmers. I still use the vba/excel/sql stack for helper tasks and I have also programmed useful macros for the use of the team.\n\nThroughout all this time I've maintained a strong but outsider interest in programming. I dabbled in python like 15 years ago back when it was quite niche. I've been reading about functional programming for almost as long. Over the years I've taken and passed programming MOOCs.\n\nI'd like to become a software dev. I'd like to write beautiful, elegant solutions. I'd really prefer to jump straight into functional programming if possible. I don't mind the domain. It could easily be industrial or business.\n\nDoes it make any sense for me to zoom down on interesting position and simply apply to them ? Is my background similar to that of a complete non-programmer ?\n\nperiAct",

The development cycle was agile and the web architecture was microservices.\n\nCurrently I am taking an advanced algorithms class and a machine learning class that are killing me. I haven't really enjoyed a single second of the material (be that because of teaching or my own lack of understanding). I study hard to get passable grades, and I have to build a function aproximator neural net in two weeks. To add to my list of gripes, I seem to forget the details of concepts as soon as I grasp them (specifically for algorithms, I don't think I've grasped much in machine learning yet).\n\nI guess my question is this: From my brief experience as an SE intern, it seemed like there was little practical use for the advanced CS topics I have been beginning to study this year (I recognize that these are undergraduate courses). This is outside of academia of course. Is that an accurate statement to make? Sure, there exist companies like Micron who come our to career fairs and talk about how they are using machine learning and image processing to increase quality control throughput for silicon wafers, but is that common? Is that something recruiters and employers expect an recent BS to be able to do? Really I'm just getting discouraged. I go to class and stare at the weird hybrid of linear algebra, statistics, and calculus that is machine learning. The layers of abstraction and concepts that are \"fuzzy\" to me leave my head spinning. \n\nTL:DR\nI am experiencing some difficulty with more advanced CS concepts (machine learning and advanced algorithms), and am wondering if the industry (SE) looks for candidates to be competent in those areas.\n\nThanks for any help.

I came into the university thinking that I would be successful in what I achieve. I didn't expect to achieve the big internships from the big 4 or anything but at least some internships that I would feel proud of. Time went on and turns out that I didn't get any internships. My family criticizes me that I didn't try hard enough to get those internships and that I am a failure of a son. They said \"this is what happens when you don't go to a top university for CS\" which makes me incredibly sad since I know it's the truth. A post a while back basically showed that going to a top university is needed to have a happy life.\n\nI know that it's too late for me to do anything and when discussing with them if I can go back home until I find a job they said no. What really broke me was \"We didn't raise a failure to come back\". I am incredibly sad and don't know what to do. I tried many internships applications and now it appears that I will graduate with no job waiting or any experience. Just reading how long it took for people to find a job scares me since I will graduate with about 20k in loans and with no where to go. \n\nThe point of this post is to hear some stories of success and how to beat this depression. I just want to know what to do currently in my last year and how to find a job after graduating more efficiently. Maybe that might get my spirits up. \n\n",

            "selftext": "This be my first time here, hi folks!\n\nI've been grappling with a really distracting question on my mind. A bit of background, I'm a dev of five or so years, working for a medium sized company for the last year. \n\nLike most devs, I'm maintaining a legacy application (not my own). This is basically the flagship application of our division that's in its fourth year of release.\n\nWhen I came in, I was desperately confused about the entire codebase. There was a lot of duplication, pages-long decision trees, unexplained deviation from standard practices for the technology,  and heavy reliance on unmaintained, largely undocumented and obscure libraries.\n\nIt's been about a year, and after a number of intense study and rewriting, I managed to give it some structure, and developed a deeper understanding of a number of core components than I'm sure the last team had, since most of the stuff appeared to be written ad-hoc. It was revealed to me in time that the last team had never used this particular technology stack for application development before, so being a few years into it I genuinely believed that I was improving the product. And I felt really good. \n\nI suppose you can say I had a bad day, or maybe just one more bad day than I could usually shrug off. It's release time (It's always release time...) and I come back from the weekend finding out that the lead dev was working late into the night and discovered a pretty big bug that had gone unnoticed by QA for at least 2 weeks... and of course it was the result of my refactoring.\n\nThis wouldn't be the first time my attempts at restructuring lead to bugs, occasionally some rather large and hard to notice ones. The amount of effort, study and obsessive focus was tremendous. I had taken hastily written code full of technical debt and had given it some semblance of structure. At least an attempt at structure! It was a triumph every time, at least it felt like it at the time. \n\nThe lead (and often the manager) not so subtly imply that I'm pathologically concerned with structure. They note that every time I rewrote a component, it took time to work out all the bugs... and since I'm maintaining the application, it's essentially the same, feature-wise as when I came in.\n\nAfter about a year of this dysfunctional working relationship, I'm getting the impression that the lead (who was also the legacy version main dev) believes that I am a net negative on the project; I'm hearing words like \"disappointed\" every so often. He constantly makes reference to how flawless the legacy version was, despite there being little to no documentation and no integration testing.\n\nDoes any of this sound familiar to you guys? Is the lead just being protective of his legacy code? Is it possible to totally rewrite components and data flow and arrive at the same functionally with only minor or no bugs? Is the whole exercise of attempting to study, understand and restructure legacy code just not worth it? Is it ever worth it? Why was I hired to maintain an application if I was expected to leave everything as is?\n\nAll I know is that I feel like shit about it and I'm constantly on the defensive. I was very close to just throwing my monitor out the window and storming off. This negative cloud being fostered grows ever deeper with each passing day, and it doesn't help that there's a moderate language barrier. Advice? Similar experiences? Is all lost???",

Ive seen a lot of talk about staying in a position for too long might keep you stuck within that field.\nWell I got an internship with a startup 2 years for the summer and  I went back to school. I started again this may and have been working full time since while taking night classes. Now its a web development job (Python/Django and some Angular) but its not what I want to do as a career.\n\nI honestly still dont know what I want to do exactly since ive been messing around with a bunch of different projects but im going more towards machine learning and just building native applications for windows since my favorite language is C++. \n\nThat aside, for anyone who is around my area in the east coast. How are jobs or what are the available type of jobs. within NJ/NY. Everything I look into just seems to be web startups and since its not what I wanna do, I dont want to transfer from one to another even if the pay is higher. \n\n* Should I start looking into changing my internship before I get stuck in this field or am I still ok and should just wait until I graduate?\n\n* More of an off topic question but for a web developer internship, is $13/hr normal or higher/lower than average? Also what is the average pay for full time positions? My employer said that he would increase my pay and put me on salary once I graduated and ive been considering it due to my need to pay bills and having an job related to my field is better than any other job so I want some numbers that way I can see if its worth it or not.\n\n* Off topic question #2: Most people recommend looking into bootcamps if you want to get up to speed or want more opportunities in the software development field but thats largely for web development. Is there something similar for general/systems programming or learning material? I want to pursue machine learning but I feel like I cant do much with a bachelors and my school only offers one course on it as well. Aside from that, our 4 year school teaches a little bit of everything which is why I havent really found my niche yet since everything we get taught is only introductory.\n\nSorry for the long question filled post, just trying to figure everything out before I make a bad decision.",

            "selftext": "Hi all. I'd like to start out with some backstory.\n\nMy parents come from an East Asian country where becoming a doctor is highly respected so my entire life they wanted me to become a doctor. They made me intern at hospitals when I was in high school through various family connections and they wanted me to participate in as many medical related extra curricular activities as possible. However my passion was always tech. Ever since high school I was building my own home lab set-up with several linux servers. I wanted to become someone who worked in system administration or IT. Therefore I naturally assumed that CS was a wise major for me.\n\nI got into college as a biology major in 2011. I despised it from the first year. I hated the repetitive memorization and overall the material was just not interesting to me. I ended up changing my major to computer science starting sophomore year. I breezed through the intro courses like intro to programming, discrete math, computer architecture, and OOP. I even breezed through the remainder of calculus and physics during sophomore year. Overall everything was going well and I had a 3.7 GPA at the end of sophomore year.\n\nAt the start of junior year I got extremely lazy and I still to this day do not exactly know why. I started to skip most of my classes and cheat on all of my homework. One example was my operating systems class. I literally never attended the lecture. Not even the first one. I only went for the midterm and the final which were open book and open laptop. For all of the homework assignments I just looked on Github for the answers from the previous semester when students took it (they kept them in public repos) and copied them. I made a basic script that loaded all of the student answers from GitHub from the same homework assignment over the years (I had to find them myself though) and ran them through the plagiarism checked that was FOSS. After I made sure there was no indication I cheated I submitted the assignments.\n\nFor exams, I would usually cram for 2 nights and do just well enough on them to pass. I learned what professors would put on the exams after a couple of months of doing this and I only studied that material. I would then forget everything. I know almost nothing operating systems, networks, databases, algorithms, or data structures, despite getting B's or better in all of those classes.\n\nMy junior year I got an internship at a large tech company (100,000+ employees) that has a smallish office in SF. The only reason I got it was because of a referral from my dad's friend. I never had a technical interview. I just had a brief phone screen and an onsite interview with the department lead that was completely non-technical. At this point I didn't really know how to program. I was so scared even writing a line of code. I could easily make modifications to code that was written already and even point out some issues, but I was way too scared to even write a line of code declaring a dictionary in C#. All I did for 3 months at this internship was modify ~500 lines of code for an old desktop application. They gave me an offer anyway for $97k/yr + $20k signing bonus and $50k stock vested over 4 years. I signed without even negotiating or thinking since I knew I was too stupid to get a job anywhere else.\n\nAfter my senior year of college I started working for the above company and I have now been here full-time for 2 years and 2 months. I still to this day do not know how my department makes any money, as neither I or anyone else does anything at all. We don't actually make useful software for the company and most of us don't do shit. I haven't written any of my own software since I have been here. I've been doing code reviews for a few people every so often and I have been trying to identify unoptimized code and code that may have security issues. That's it. I'm still way too scared to even write something like an XML parser...\n\nI am so lucky I am even employed right now as I am way too scared to write programs because I do not know how. I know that if I am fired or laid off I won't get a job anywhere else... I wish I could go back in time and actually pay attention in my classes. I wish I had more of a drive to develop on my free time. I just wish I could start college again and actually learn something so I could be good at what I do.\n\nAt this point I am unsure of what I should do. I get off of work at 6 PM and I go to the gym until 8 PM. I shower and eat dinner until 9 PM. From 9 PM to midnight I usually just play video games. I basically have 3 hours per day to get shit done but I am too scared to even update my resume as I have no idea what to put on it. I keep telling myself every morning \"Today is the day I read Cracking The Coding Interview and work on FreeCodeCamp so I can get a proper job\" but I never do it.\n\nIn you guys' opinion what should I do at this point? I hate that this is a stupid sob story. I know I got myself to this point. However I want to change. I actually enjoy reading Hacker News and this subreddit as well as following along with the latest tech news and even news about things I know very little about like Javascript frameworks. I know a little bit of C++ and C# but that is about it. I know nothing about web development or anything else.\n\nI'm really ashamed of myself but I'd love to hear any recommendations any of you guys have. Thanks for reading this guys. I hope you all have a more productive day than I did and have a nice rest of your day :).",

There are a few concerns I have:\n\n1) My partner is getting increasingly annoyed at me for beating myself up for not solving a LeetCode problem because he believes that I will be fine and it's unnecessary to stress out so much. I however feel the need to aim for perfection because I heard that the top companies do expect bug-free, clean code. It's clear that the stress is taking a toll on our relationship - how did other people deal with this? Bottom line is, I don't want to lose a loved one in this process. \n\n2) I have received a bunch of rejections already. Some are direct rejects from resume screening ('not a good match in skill set'), some are failed coding challenges (not passing all test cases). I know that it's normal, it's part of the process. So far I've been shrugging them off my shoulders, but I wonder what is the healthiest way to deal? \n\n3) How can I keep up my motivation up in face of failure? This is different than anything I've ever done before - the rejection is constant and it just gets to me sometimes. \n\n4) How to manage school work on top of internship search. So far I basically neglected my school work, but I can't afford to do that for much longer because things are picking up speed. It feels very unnatural for me to be such a slacker, but what bothers me more is that I feel like I'm putting time / energy into a process that will ultimately benefit me less intellectually than the class material. And if I fail to find an internship at all, I can't help but think that it was all for nothing. How did people deal with this... \n\ntl;dr: need advice managing stress & finding balance between school, personal life, intellectual growth and internship search",

Probably be awkward and hard to schedule, not sure if it would be preferable to having him hear it from HR/upper management.\n\nI should add that in the past my manager has taken it very personally when employees leave, and was particularly upset last time someone left while he was away - hence why I want to speak with him in person.

            "selftext": "I am self taught web developer in the midwest looking for some career advice. I have struggled with health issues that have prevented me from going down some paths and now I am trying to figure out what my options are.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nA little background: I have always been into computers. I went to college for CS twice but dropped out because of my health both times \u2014 DeVry and Western Governors. While I was in school I worked at a tech support call center for a while then made money repairing computers and setting up home networks. Since then, I taught myself web development and started freelancing online. I caught the attention of a large local non-profit who needed a developer. I did contract work for them for a year then was hired on full time. About a year after that my health issues got in the way again and I had to leave that job. During my recovery, I did a little more freelance web development. Now I am looking for employment again. My health is the most stable it has ever been. That being said, going into a high stress environment is not an option. I need something low stress that provides the ability to take some time ofh here and there when I need to. So my question is, what do I need to do to get from where I am now to a job like that?\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI want to do software development of some sort; however, I learn quickly and can take some time to learn new skills before looking for work so, I am fine if the position is not web development.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe best path that I see right now is targeting a software development position with the state. That would be (mostly) low stress and could become fairly flexible. It would be something dependable and secure. The software jobs at the state are pretty much all centered around .NET. So that is something I would need to learn. They do not require a degree just development experience of some sort and familiarity with the technologies they use. So, I don\u2019t yet qualify for that, but that can change. The state is not the easiest place to get in to - so to me it seems like the best option would be to apply for any position that I am qualified for, IT or not. Work that position while I am learning .NET then move into a developer position internally.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nDoes this seem like the best option or should I be looking somewhere else - a different industry or type of job? Would it be best for me to go back to school for a CS degree?\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFollow Up Question: If trying to get a software development position for the state makes sense and I do not need to go back to school, what should my next step be in preparing for that position? The primary concern that I have is that I can learn C# and related technologies as they are used by the state, but I feel like there are still some skills or knowledge that I will be missing by not getting the degree. Even things like basic algorithms and data structures I have not learned. Should I start off focusing on learning the fundamentals of computer science before I look into .NET? What are the skills that I need to have?",

I'll be graduating in Septembre 2018.\n\nThis year I also started what we call a dual (or double?) degree in Business Administration and Management.\n\nThis is a one year course that I follow simultaneously on Thursday and Fridays.\n\n\nI already did three internships, two in small companies near my hometown, and my last one at SalesForce, but in Paris offices.\nThis was my best experience so far, I really loved it !\n\n\nI am looking for a 4 to 6 month end-of-study internship and I'd definitely love to work in the San Francisco Bay Area in a big IT company.\n\nMy manager as SalesForce tried to get me an internship in HQ but they only have 12-week programs for internships. \n\nI already applied for Apple, Microsoft, Uber, Dropbox, Airbnb, Microsoft, Amazon, Snapchat, Twitter but I feel like my chances are really low.\n\nNot to mention I require VISA sponsorship in case I'll move.\n\nIs there any chance for me to get that kind of internship or should I prioritise France/Europe for next year ?\nAny tips/advice would be appreciated !\n\nMany thanks :)\n\nTLDR : French guy willing to get an internship in the SF Bay Area - what are my chances ? how to increase my chances ?\n",

I'm a Massachusetts resident and I currently have a Bachelor's degree in a non-Stem related field with a GPA of 3.4 from that degree (not sure if that is relevant). \n\nI've been looking into Umass Amherst's Second Bachelor's program which seems to be the best in terms of cost and as I understand it they have a good computer science program. Currently I'm taking courses to meet their prerequisites which are Data Structures & Algorithms (currently taking), Calculus I (currently taking) and Calculus II. I know Boston University also offers a Second Bachelor's degree program, but is far more expensive. \n\nMy question is if anyone here knows of any other schools that offer degrees for students pursuing a degree in computer science as a second bachelor's degree. with the ability to transfer credits from my previous degree? This is so it doesn't take the standard four years to finish and I can hopefully complete the second degree in two - two and a half (according to the person I've spoken to at Umass Amherst). Also if anyone has experience with going back to school for a second degree from the schools I mentioned above or just in general I would love some advice! \n\nThank for reading this!",

I was immediately put on this insanely complicated project by myself, with no code reviews or mentorship and almost no collaboration (I was pretty much marooned on an island, and nobody ever had reason to talk to me). I am a pretty resourceful person and confident so I managed for a while until I finally got tired of trudging through it alone and raised concerns with enough people to finally get some changes made. Anyway, during this process, I tried to get some help from my immediate supervisor, who blew me off as usual, so I went over his head to the VP of technology and expressed my concerns in a somewhat emotional discussion (I was at my wits end). Anyway, my immediate supervisor knew what I did and ever since then he has been a little cold to me.\n\nFast forward to today, I have been moved to a new team (on the same project though) and I am told that I will finally have help pretty soon. Now the team I am on has some pretty established people at this small company, and I don't want to keep feeling isolated. What is the best way to really fit in with people and not screw this up? I still feel like nothing I do matters to anyone, and I can't really gain their respect if my contributions make zero impact (I'm on a long term project that won't matter for a while).\n\nThanks in advance.",

I am a second year CS/Math student studying part time, currently working in supply chain for a big corporate company.\n\nSo far I have been getting good marks, distinctions for everything (> 75%), however I have done just about zero coding outside of my c++ curriculum. My thoughts were that good marks leads to interviews which leads to a job. After networking with guys from the engineering department and shadowing them, I landed an interview for QA automation, not exactly my dream but a great foot in the door for the field.\n\nLong story short I did the interviews, my first tech interviews ever as well as hacker rank tests, but I did not get the job. They wanted someone more senior for the position as the one team lead quit recently, although they encouraged me to apply again in a few months.\n\nI really do not mind not getting the job, QA might have been a wrong choice and I learnt a lot from the experience. I know that my theoretical knowledge was good but I also know they could tell I do not have much experience building stuff. I probably could have landed the job if I had projects to show them and discuss.\n\nThe problem is math is taking up so much time, I enjoy it but I can't help but feeling that the time I am investing in math can be better spent coding and building projects and really turn myself into a great developer with a portfolio to back it up. Should I pursue the double major or is math not that important? (Quick note a double major in my school is standard, you generally have two majors or one with electives to make up the credits, it is not the same as a US double major) I have done up until 2nd level linear algebra and discrete math, starting calculus sequence next semester.\n\nI could either stop doing any more math and focus on CS and info systems which will free up tons of time, or I could do up until 2nd level math (so calc 1-3 and differential equations and fill the rest with info systems electives) and skip all the proof courses like analysis and abstract algebra.\n\nI was holding on to math since I felt like machine learning could be an interesting field, but is an entire major necessary? Would calculus + linear algebra and discrete not be enough?\n\nSorry that this post ended up a lot longer than expected, these are just things that have been on my mind the past few weeks and not having professors to talk to makes it tiring to try figure it all out on my own.\n\nLooking forward to any and all advice!\n\nTL:DR; Should I drop math courses to focus on CS and have more time for side projects",

It only has a handful of people working there but they have been around for 10+ years and like hiring young people. \n\nSome backstory, I got into programming a few years ago but was not very good and gave up. Story of my life. However last year I picked it up again and got very into web development, It started casual only doing a bit now then. I learnt some HTML, CSS and JS nothing major. Then about 6 months ago I decided I would commit to it during my summer. So I took some courses and in them I learnt HTML, CSS and JS rather well and how to use a few things like Bootstrap well.\n\nFollowing that I picked up NodeJS and Express with the intent to move to React or Angular. \n\nThen about a week back I got offered this job out of nowhere through someone I know who is the same age. They are paying me double minimum wage (which is something like \u00a34.05 for my age) and I can work as many or as little hours as I want and on top of that I can do it at home as long as I go to the office on Friday for a couple hours.\n\n\nI am currently in my last year of Sixth Form (Im 17 going on 18 for Americans and such) where I am studying CS. I am learning how to use Ruby on Rails for this job which I am picking up quickly. But how do I make the most of this? Is there anything I should be doing?",

So I began a CS Degree. \n\nI get credit for the physics and most if the math classes so... Yay... It's not a 4 year pursuit.\n\nSo that's my background, but I'm interested in pursuing computational physics (like new types of laser design, optimization for radar/optics) or algorithm design (a la image processing/ targeting). \n\nIf one of you is in either of these fields, or can point me to more information about these fields like other non defense oriented applications of them, I'd really appreciate it and also, if there are any pros & cons of each I'd love a few more opinions.",

I had 6 offers and this was the 'best fit' from these, but some friends have it much better. I basically had no 'lag' period (my 'summer' was the weekend) between being out of school and starting work (was the same with my internship the year prior which also led to part time work and a full time offer). I don't mind this but it makes me wonder if I should've looked longer or at a different time.\n\nI negotiated up from a 50k offer to 62.5k, but as an example, I have a friend who was offered 82k and most seem to be around the 70s. This is all in the same area. Now, my focus isn't all salary, I was more determined to get my foot in the door and becoming 'officially a SWE' but all throughout school all my peers would say \"I'm worth a lot\" and those same ones now are making more and I just feel like I've neglected something important / failed in a big way.\n\nAbout myself: I'm always building / learning something new. Have more personal projects than I can count. During school, I founded a CS tutoring service, was president of my ACM chapter, won prizes at two hackathons(first place at one), and even organized one for my school. I have research experience, several personal projects, an internship, worked as an iD Tech instructor, and delivered products that are widely used every day. I feel like I worked really hard to do everything I could during this time and didn't translate it at all to my compensation. Even one of my friends who \"couldn't find work\" reluctantly joined a consultant service and is making 65k.\n\nNow that I'm already here, there no plans to 'jump ship' without having a meaningful contribution in my current workplace -- I try to 'leave my mark' everywhere, but for those who are or have been in a similar position I wonder what would the best path be to get ahead, besides the obvious? \n\nShould I wait till my first large contribution to bring up salary to my employer? Should I just plan to market myself soon? I felt close to a Big-N once and would love that on my resume, am I overthinking things? Something else?\n\nThank you for reading this far.",

Quick backstory: mom and dad sick, brother is staying home for next 2 years to take care of them, when I'm done with college I'm moving back home (village with less then 3000 people in Croatia). I'm gonna live there for few years, depending on how long they have. I'm 19 and right now I'm in second year of Informatics college (networking and programming).   \n\nI know basics of c, c++, a little bit more of python, c# and java (around 100 hours use of each), and a lot of css and html (450-500 hours, mostly because I was working on some projects with a friend). There is 0% chance I'll be able to work somewhere in village, so I need to figure out how to work remotely. My interests are automation, statistics, geological research, programming vehicles (cars and drones), security and video games, in that order. Every day I have time for following: 6 hours for college, 6 hours for sleep, 2 hours for SO, 2 hours for food, shower etc. and 8 hours to study. This is my plan and if you have any advice I'd appreciate it:  \n\nOctober 2017 -> Go through Automate boring stuff with Python  \nNovember - January -> Work on my projects, this is where I need most help, I don't know what to make with little experience. I have so much ideas but they all seem like they would take too long (two or more months).   \nEntire 2018 -> Work full time for someone in Python (I'm gonna live in Zagreb, capitol of Croatia, during this time)  \nJanuary 2019 - June/July/August 2019 -> I have no idea what to plan for then. Should I keep working for someone or should I try to set up my portfolio? Try to make one big thing or a lot of little programs? What site works best for getting steady jobs?   \n\nAnd most importantly, does this plan seem realistic? Or is it better to pick up another language? I don't care for who I work, how much I work, do I have to work nights and sleep during day if I'm working for someone in different time zone, all I need is 700\u20ac a month for food and necessities.

Since returning I have a 3.7GPA but it will only get harder to get my GPA up as I go. I see a lot of people talking about how important GPA and internships are for these positions.\n\nSo I guess my question is, as a student from the midwest (Milwaukee, specifically) what are my best options to try and get experience/internships in this field so I can present myself as a viable candidate when I graduate? It is not a big field in my locale and I'm not sure how to finesse myself into a position where I can at least get some experience, so I'm not some random with no background trying to get a job in QF in NYC or CHI when I graduate. Thanks in advance, I can offer any other helpful info as well, just ask.",

I'm from a poor family. I got full ride scholarship to study in a really good college.\n\n2 years in I met a CEO of a big tech corporation who saw something special in me. He gave me the opportunity to start my own department in the company. I built my team from ground up and heading the management of our IoT services. I'm responsible for project management, talking to clients and coming up with business strategies. I'm getting paid a fat figure.\n\nI find it incredibly difficult to manage studies at college and the job, let alone a social life. I've been just passing my courses and not actually learning anything since most of my focus and energy goes into the job. I feel like I'm just using the college hostel to sleep and the campus to live. I don't feel like a college student.\n\nI don't want to ask for a demotion and get less work because I want to join a company in a software management position when I graduate and going from a head of department to an engineer will look bad on the resume.\n\nSince I'm on a full-ride aid, I don't need to the job's money to survive. Should I quit the job and focus on college for these last 2 years?\n\nI've been thinking that once I graduate, I can keep progressing in my career and put my full effort in it. I've my entire life to do that. However, I'm never going to get the college experience again.  I don't want to regret continuing this job later.\n\nI'm on a contract which will end the next week. They want me to extend the contract so that I keep working. If I quit now, I just have to NOT extend my contract (I won't have to serve any notice period). \n\nQuitting is a painful thing to do because we finally have a few real client projects and if I leave now, it'll bring a bit of chaos in the organization.\n\nWhat do you think?",

So far in terms of CS related qualifications I have a D in Computer Science - I failed because the exam board doesn't care about code... my teacher taught my entire class how to not do the write up which was 60% of our grade. I managed to get all of the programs they asked of us to write working 100% and was one of the only 3 to do so out of the 60 students we had. In addition to this I have a D* in BTEC I.T Programming. I picked programming over computer science at A level because I wanted to program, that is what I am good at and enjoy. I know python okay but am stronger with C# and try to learn as much as I can in my free time. other than that I am pretty shite in terms of computer theory. So what did you know when you went to uni for a CS degree? My sister went previously but dropped out and said her course board had people constantly talking about hacking into websites and just loads of confusing shit have no idea about and it sort of scares me because maybe I just haven't taught myself enough to go for a uni degree. Or is it those people are just trying to look \"cool\"... I dunno give your opinion please it helps a lot.\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone for the comments, really given me a lot of confidence.

Of course, I understand this is not an excuse. There are other students who are doing the same thing as me and have the same workload and yet they are not struggling like me.

I saw other students who I seriously doubt spent this much time on this task and yet they were able to complete it. The only logical explanation is that they are able to grasp concepts quicker than me. What other students learns in a week, I need 2 weeks to learn and knowing this makes me feel so defeated...\n\nI feel that when your code works out and you successfully solved the problem, programming is heaven. When it doesn't work out, programming is hell! \n\nThe assessments in which I did well are on topics in which I have studied before in my own spare time before the semester.

Don't really mind what the internship will entail as long as it's at least somewhat related. \n\n\nThe problem is that I don't go to a top uni (just a state school, no real rankings), I don't have experience aside from just school (I still work a retail job to earn money lol) and I don't have many extra-curriculars (joined the CS club this semester but was only able to attend a few meetings so far). This means my resume is dry on all aspects. \n\n\nThe only things saving me are my GPA (3.65 as of my freshman year and it's looking good so far) and I built a pretty bare bones website from scratch which also has a few random cs projects I created on my own time. (also plan on making YouTube videos for math, physics and cs)\n\n\nWhat's the best way to secure myself an internship? I'm posting here because I assume a lot of you have had an internship previously or are going to have one up coming and also to gain some outside perspective. Is it best to go through my school through like a career fair?

            "selftext": "Hey everyone, I wanted to make a throwaway to just thank everybody for all of the help you have given me directly and indirectly. I found this subreddit about three years ago and I thought I would just use it once or twice for help getting an internship. Instead I have visited nearly every single day, posted my resume at least twenty five times and asked dozens of questions ranging from interview prep to company reputations. I have also collected dozens of super helpful links that are still on my bookmark bar, like [this excel sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1z3_OfZdPXiOOgHi7uY5nvLuQX_qbpaxmYNXHHiuuV0I/edit#gid=0), [intern.supply](http://www.intern.supply/), and this [massive cheat sheet](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/5gr8nw/heres_a_sanitized_list_of_530_free_online/).\n\n\nI was never able to obtain an internship before graduating despite hundreds of applications and a handful of interviews but the preparation I did for these helped me later on for full-time interviews. It was really hard seeing everyone else obtain their 3rd or 4th internship and receive full-time offers several months before graduating while I was stuck doing manual labor over the summers for minimum wage. I suffered severe depression from the beginning of my Sophomore year until about a month ago and my sliding grades and poor interview performances were a few symptoms of that. I kept checking out my classmates on LinkedIn and the salary sharing threads here and kept feeling sorry for myself until I realized I just needed to keep improving instead of worrying about what other people thought of me. I felt so monumentally insecure going into interviews because I felt like I was always the weakest candidate because of my lack of experience.\n\nI also kept a folder on my email titled \"rejections\" because I was just getting so fucking many. I kept adding and adding to it because I wanted to look back on the day when I would get my first offer and see all of the hard work I've done. I do not recommend this.\n\n\nEventually after many hours of interview practice, dozens of hackerrank questions, reading CTCI front-to-back, a significant personal project and a one and a half month post-graduation internship I finally have my first offer. I didn't make this because I want to brag or anything, I just want to thank the contributors for all of their generous help and to provide some reassurance to those still struggling. If you work hard enough you will eventually succeed. Just keep at it.\n\nThank you all so very much, I would not be in this position without you.\n",

While dabbling in programming, I have decided not to pursue physical therapy because I have enjoyed the endless learning, problem solving, and creation.\n\nSo far I have worked through some of Harvard's CS50, finished a course on git/github, and am currently working on Free Code Camp and reading through the You Don't Know JS book series. I am currently tracking 40+ hours per week working through Free Code Camp and [P1xt's job ready guide](https://github.com/kgalang/p1xt-guides/blob/master/job-ready.md)\n\nMy professional goals are centered around competency. I want to get my first developer job, go back to school for my masters, and spend my career solving problems for others by being good at what I do. Financially, in 10 years, I hope to be able to take care of my parents to the point where they'll be able to retire.\n\n**Finally, My Question**\n\nFor my situation, which of these options do you think I should pursue and why?\n\n* Go back to school to get a 4 year BS in CS: This would take me about 2.5 years and $25k of loans (currently don't have debt)\n\n* Go to Western Governors University, an online non profit university, to spend 1 year and $6k for a BS in software development (seems to have a good amount of focus on IT).\n\n* Aim for a reputable bootcamp and spend about $20k (for either Hack Reactor or App Academy in San Francisco). I would be able to move in with my family all around the Bay Area.\n\n* Become fully committed to being self taught, continue down my current path, attempt to fill in any fundamental gaps I've missed from a CS degree, and persevere while trying to break into an entry level developer position. \n\n**TL;DR**\nI was supposed to be a physical therapist but have began to love programming. I have a liberal and irrelevant BS degree. I don't know what route to pursue next so that I can break into a long career as a programmer. Should I go get a second BS degree, go to a bootcamp, or just continue teaching myself?\n\nThank you!\n",

It would be a $20k/yr paycut and a loss of benefits, but I'd have creative freedom and a lot of upward opportunity. It's not super stable (funded by grants), but the work I put in will hopefully grow my earnings. It's the perfect job for me, aside from compensation\n\n2) Take the time to find a remote position in the software realm (instead of firmware). I could likely find a job making $20k more than what I currently make, but also likely without the creative freedom offered in job #1. \n\nFor those that have had a similar decision to make, what did you do? Any regrets? The 20k loss wouldn't kill me or put me out on the street, but it'd be a belt tightening exercise for sure. If it matters, I have a family and my wife makes good money. \n\nSo, dream job with growth potential, or 6 figures?",

I am currently doing a 1 year MS program (in CS) at the same school I did my undergrad and am miserable. Graduate school is not for me. \n\nThe position they extended an offer to me for is a normal entry level position that does not require a Master's (it requires a BS, which I got this past May) and I'm not even 100% sure if they know I am pursuing the MS anyway. What they do know is that my plan was to finish up school and graduate in May. I'm considering dropping out of the program and then asking if I can start work in January instead of June.\n\nIs there a possibility my offer gets rescinded? I know this answer probably depends very much on the company in question, but I would like to know what people think of the situation and/or if anyone has been there before.\n\nTL;DR - Got FTE after summer internship for entry level position that doesn't require MS. I am in 1 year MS program and miserable. I want to drop out then start work earlier. Will I get the offer rescinded?",

I currently work for a fortune 500, but I'm not entirely sure what I do.  I write scripts here and there, I debug performance issues, etc.  I don't really do any software engineering or systems administration\\engineering.  I am not in a product team, my title is 'systems engineer'.\n\nI've been offered a job as a software engineer at a very small company.  This company is fairly successful and has been in business for many years, but they're not actively trying to grow.  I've worked with everyone at this small company before and I'm not worried about culture fit or anything like that.  They're going to match the pay that I was getting at the larger company so I'm not worried about this from a compensation perspective.  At the fortune 500 company there have been constant layoffs and re-orgs (which is how I'm in this limbo position), whereas everyone at this small company has been there 10+ years so I'm not really concerned about the stability aspect of this all.\n\nThe *only* issue with this smaller company is that while I will be writing code in C, Java, and Python, the product that I will be developing has to be written in a domain specific language used only by this company and their customers.  The company does not expect me to be an expert in this DSL immediately and they recognize that they will have to take up to a year to fully train me.  The people training me are the best programmers I've ever met, each with 20+ years experience writing C and x86 assembly.\n\nMy questions are:\n\n1. Does anyone see this move from a large company to a small one as hurting my career longer term?  I did see other topics about this in this subreddit but they seemed to be from the perspective of someone's first job. \n2. While I just view programming languages as more tools in my toolbelt, will taking a position that uses a DSL that's not applicable outside of this domain hurt my career options in the future?  I do have documented professional experience in other programming languages on my resume.\n3. Any other things I should consider?  Would you make this same move?\n\nThank you!\n",

            "selftext": "Hi folks,\n\nI've been applying to some Big N jobs in Silicon Valley (coming from SoCal), and I have a weird situation. One company (A) told me I have the job and is processing an offer, and I have another on-site interview with company B in a week and a half.\n\nHere's the situation: \n\nCompany A wants me to say I won't pursue other companies if they make a great offer. Which I am inclined to do, even if it means I can't play them off of each other. The problem is... the non-official preliminary \"teaser\" offer that was hinted at was pretty low (compared to others I can find here): $120k salary (not much of a raise factoring in my CoL increase), $90k RSU -- no other details. This is for 4-5 years of experience in software engineering.\n\nI like company A way more than B, but I feel a bit stiffed as far as salary goes, which makes me feel less than excited to join company A.\n\nAny advice?\n\nEdit: According to glassdoor, my \"market value\" is $144,152 base salary in the Silicon Valley area. I don't know that I feel super secure in asking for a $25,000 salary increase, especially since that seems the least likely thing company A is willing to give. I'm at a loss.",

I play video games, build computers, keep up with tech news and love talking about it, so naturally, Computer Science has always caught my interest. I also want to break 6 figures in my lifetime. I am pretty decent at math. I've taken 3 semesters of math (2 developmental and college algebra - I got my GED in HS and never took a math past freshman algebra, and then took a 6 year break) and my averages from these classes were 97, 101, and 96. (in order) Math just makes sense, being able to have step by step instructions in order to solve equations, I've always been good at that. I have never done any programming. Not that I don't want to, I just have never had the desire to start learning.\n\nanother passion of mine is working in a team and leading said team. I have been told I give off a \"natural leader\" vibe, and I have ran various online communities in my years on the net and leading a group of people in an administrative role is something I particularly enjoy.\n\nI am also doing CompTIA as a backup plan to either one of these, grabbing my certs while I am in school. I currently own a small side gig reparing/building/troubleshooting PCs, printers, etc and I just landed my first business contract (very small time, auto shop), and I was looking to get my certs. My father is going to pay for me to get my IT Fundamentals, A+ and my Network+, then I am on my own in terms of certs. On the CompTIA roadmap, Software Development, IT Management and Strategy, and Hardware, Services and Infrastructure all call to me. Obviously this is all too much for one person, and if anyone can give me some advice to start on a path, would be great!!\n\n\nI also intend to get a Master's for whichever degree I pick.\n\nTLDR: cant decide between MIS/CS masters, cant decide on IT career path as a backup, help pls",

            "selftext": "*Reddit Gold for anyone with a relevant and complete answer*\n\nHey Reddit,\nI am 23 years old with a degree in Civil Engineering (specializing in project management and building science) from the best university in Canada. I live in Toronto with my parents and have about 7 months of experience in my field through 3 jobs, last one of which I was laid off after a month with the reason being \u201cim too good at this job and this position is beneath me, we dont think you will stay\u201d but I think it also had to do with me not meshing well with the team (only 12 people in office).\nI only went into civil engineering to make money and Im not really that passionate about it. I'm at a point where Im not sure where I want to be and what I want to do. I was not really happy about the work I did in any of the 3 roles, it was just OK, it was a job after all. While Im not employed and have some time, I want to make a serious decision about where I want to take my career.\n\nI would list my **passions** as the following:\n\n* utility apps that make life easier for individuals or companies (I have a few good ideas)\n* websites that do something useful, either for free or for ads\n* financial tech (I dabble in day trading and invested in crypto)\n\nMy ideal job would have the following **qualities** (of course I don't expect to get every criterion, and not most off the bat if any):\n\n* flex hours (not a huge fan of strict 9-5 hours, I\u2019d be willing to stay 9-9 some days and have a shorter next day for example), looking more for an objective based roles as opposed to hourly ones (e.g this is what I want and when I want it by, get it done).\n* flex location (I like to be able to work over the internet from any location part of the time, like maybe for 2-3 months a year I could submit my work electronically).\n* High entrepreneurship potential.\n* non-linear pay (i.e not a fan of \"x amount of hours = x amount of pay\"), looking more for a quadratic pay or objective based pay (i.e get this done by this time, get paid).\n* modern culture (i have absolutely had it with the archaic way things are done in civil engineering, it feels like everyone is from decades ago, wasting tons of paper because \u201cthe boss isn\u2019t comfortable working on a computer\u201d, and just generally very old-school attitudes about everything).\n* I do like outside work and being out and about in the sun, not a huge fan of sitting in an office. I actually really enjoy physical labor as weird as that sounds, it makes me happy to utilize my body as well as my mind and not just sit in a chair.\n* also not a huge fan of dressing formal or business casual for work, I love my jeans.\n\nRight now Im considering these **options**:\n\n* go back to school for comp sci and start as an employee first (google is my dream company e.g), the reason this is my preferred option is because I have trouble staying focused properly if Im on my own. **Should I take undergrad CS or grad CS ? Appereantly there is grad CS programs that dont need a CS backround. I have little coding background.** Also. How much will I improve my employability if I have a degree in engineering already?\n* just pick something up on my own and go at full entrepreneurship from the start (e.g learn to code off youtube and hope to hit it off with an app). But how likely is this to succeed?\n\nWhat do you think Reddit ?\n\nDo you work for a company that fits the criteria/qualities that I look for ? Let me know so I keep them in mind. \n\nI am especially looking for opinions from currently employed Comp Sci majors, coding entrepreneurs, people working in finance (fin tech) to chime in about their education\u2019s employability and entrepreneurship prospects in North America (particularly Canada) in the near future and whether the lifestyle matches what Im looking for.\nAlso looking for any comments from digital nomads and people with jobs who fit the characteristics I mentioned that I haven\u2019t considered.

I am well aware that this is a US based sub, but this trend appears almost everywhere I read about data science, from /r/cscareerquestionseu to Medium to job ads in the US. \n\nSAS is a tabular, statistical programming language that churns big data. I\u2019ve started to learn python in my free time, and honestly it\u2019s major benefits appear to be its ability to both be a back end language for web development AND a fully functioning data science suite with modules like MatplotLib, Seahorse, Pandas...\n\nThis doesn\u2019t change the fact that SAS is a paid for language. Large companies pay for the security of being able to call a support line if something goes wrong, rather than having to rely on a team of in house workers... this alone makes me think that large tech companies like Facebook or Google would be managing their data using a dedicated statistical language. Why aren\u2019t they? \n\nFrom what I\u2019ve seen, SAS is big in regulated industries like pharmaceuticals and financial services, largely due to the strict regulation on people\u2019s data. That didn\u2019t really exist for big tech firms when they first sprung up, but with the introduction of regulation like GDPR, and a magnifying glass on the world economy, you\u2019d think using open source languages would become less attractive. \n\nPlease note I have absolutely no problem with Python! In fact I really love it and wish my company would let me use it so I could get better at it, but unfortunately it\u2019s just SAS, SQL and VBA for me. Yeah, big data projects like Hadoop are coming along, but SAS is a company that\u2019s adapting to the times and will probably fight their competition with as much ferocity as their shareholder\u2019s investments will allow.

I am trying to transition into a career a field related to computer science, so I have been learning Python and it has inspired me to start automating some of the Excel/PDF work that the guys in our office do. Would it be a good idea to contribute to this company and post my code to GitHub? I know, I'd be writing small scripts in Python, but I'd literally be the only person doing this kind of work at a very small company (less than 40 people). I have been making a lot of small steps in near-random directions for the past three months (Automate the Boring Stuff with Python, Algorithms Design Manual, other resources/books). I want to make sure I can transition into an entry level job in a year. I have felt like I could have gone two ways with a career trajectory, computer science or a more outdoorsy field, I feel like the field I am in right now, it's just not what I expected financially or physically.\n\nTLDR: I am just at a loss for if I should work on a side project, or do work at this job.

            "selftext": "Hello,\n\nI'm 28 and thinking of switching careers. The last few years I've been working as a representative for a company, which means I have to travel a lot, especially abroad. This means I don't have much time to spend at home with my wife and we were planning on starting a family soon at some point and I don't want to be away for weeks on end when we do start a family.\n\nSo I've been looking at college courses that interest me and one of these was software engineering. It would mean I'd have to go back to college for 4 years to learn a whole new set of skills, but it would mean I'd be able to be home more with my future family. \n\nThe thing is, we probably won't be waiting another 4 years before I finish that degree before starting a family, so I have no idea if it's a good idea. It would also mean a loss of income for the next few years, and we kind of agreed we wouldn't start on a family unless with both have jobs and a good income, but the way things are going with my current job I think I'll be burned out pretty soon, it's lonely being away for so long, the days are long and quite stressful.\n\nAnyway, enough exposition about my situation the questions I had were these:\n\n* 1. Is SE extremely difficult, in the sense that it takes a lot of time (more than 50 hours a week) to study it as a college course? I'm asking since I would like the option to combine it with a family in 2 years or so.\n* 2. How important are math skills? I always was pretty good at it back in high school, but while I deal with some finance stuff due to work, I wouldn't really call it higher maths. What I'm saying is it's been a while since I did the really hard stuff and just wondering if I need to get back the old books or not.\n* 3. How are the job opportunities in the field? Is there a lot of demand and not so much supply, or would it be fairly difficult to get a job once graduated. And on a related note, what is a average salary.\n* 4. Apart from some hobby websites I've built in the past, my coding experience is basically zero. I actually liked the coding I used to do, figuring out how to make things work etc. But I would start from scratch basically. Would it be better to not go for SE if I don't have prior coding knowledge?\n* 5. Any general advice you want to give to a person like me that's unsure of their career path that is thinking of going in the SE direction?\n\nThank you for your time and effort in reading this and thank you for any replies in advance that can help me make a more informed decision.",

It has been 4 months, they moved me to different project (they got some new project) and told me that my role/designation will be changed to \"Software Support Engineer\" from \"Software Developer\". \n\nI was not okay with it because my skill (Java/J2EE developer) set doesn't match with software support role. So I asked HR whether it is temporary or permanent (I thought since for new project it take time to hire new people it will be temporary role change) but they clarified that it's a permanent role change.\n\nAccording to my offer letter they hired me as a Software developer. They forced/asked me to apply for their internal job posting and acknowledging that I am okay with role change. I tried convincing HR and manager, but keep saying it won't affect any salary or anything. It's just simple role change and other people have also gone through it.\nAt one point they said \"it's better to have some work than no work\".\n\nThe main concern is my skill set doesn't match as new support role. As it doesn't require any coding skill as it's just plain support (With some plain 1st level analysis), and all issues and bugs are transferred to development teams. There is some scope of automation which is not clearly defined as it's a new project.\n\n1)Will it be hard for me to get job as a developer in case I continue working here for a year? Since my new role/ experience certificate will have Software Support Engineer written over it.\n2) Here software support doesn't require any coding skills, it just firing already written PL/SQL queries to check error in system.\n3) Should I look for new job ?",

I have a \"working knowledge\" of a few languages, but I'm not really an expert in anything. The first 2 years of my schooling were primarily in Java and I feel like I had a pretty good grasp of it, but I haven't written a Java program since, and I feel like I would have to spend a lot of time relearning syntax and OOP. A lot of my classes since then were algorithmic or hardware/OS based since then and I've done a lot less programming in those. For those classes where I was programming it was all in C (C89), and while I feel I'm decent at it I usually do have to spend time resolving some pointer issues or have to google specific libraries/functions (especially anything related to I/O) so I'm not sure if i should pick C as my interview language. \n\nMeanwhile at internships I've had I've worked primarily with javascript and C#, and while I got up to speed on these really quick and was able to do all my work projects in them, I feel like I have a very narrow understanding of the languages as I focused on things related to the specific tasks I was working on.\n\nLastly, I took a free intro to python course online over the summer while working and enjoyed it a lot. It also seems like a really good languages for interviews as you have less stuff to mess with like syntax, static types, etc, but I don't know if I'm good enough with it to choose it either and it seems intimidating to choose the language I'm least familiar with to do interviews/projects in.\n\nI would really appreciate some help with this!",

            "selftext": "So the reason I'm unhappy with my job is because I HATE the tech stack, or lack of. It's Netsuite development. When I took the job offer I thought it would be like most other web development jobs and I could continue building off the web development work I did during my internships. Basically, Netsuite's framework/API is very different from anything else out there and I feel that I'm not learning anything that is making me a better developer. This is at a small company that does just Netsuite. Another gut-punch is that it wasn't even my best offer, I took the job because it seemed interesting and more aligned with how I ultimately want to be a full-stack web developer.\n\nNormally, I would simply hit up some Udacity course or whatever, learn Angular or something, make a project, and start applying to other jobs. However, during my last semester of college I got into tutoring students in my Universities English-Language program and I am even still doing some stuff with them since my job ended up only being 30 minutes away from my University. I also took a Japanese class since my last semester was only 9 credits and I've been self-studying since I've graduated back in December. As a result, I think it would be really cool to take a job as an ALT in Japan for a year. Yeah, it's barely a real job but I think it'd be a cool experience to have before I end up with other responsibilities like a family, mortgage, etc. I would be doing things on sites like hackerrank and working on some kind of personal project (Kanji study-app?) in my spare time to keep my skills up.\n\nHowever, what will my resume look like after this? My most recent job will not be a software job (currently it reads like a list of chronological jobs/experiences). I've also never had an employer look at my personal projects. Take the example I gave in the previous paragraph, is that enough? Also, are employers going to think I partied for year or think I was fired from my current software job? \n\nFrom the research I've done, I've gotten answers ranging from \"as long as you're productive (learning Japanese and continuing to code) it'll be fine\" to \"It's career suicide, only losers take those teaching jobs in Asia\". \n\nAny perspective would be greatly appreciated.

I ended up getting all but 2 correct, though I am unsure which ones.

Joy and Ezra switch seats. Then Ezra and Max switch seats. Who is at the end?\" \n\nThe next question is \"Who is left of Ezra?\" \n\n\nAs you can see, the names switched mid-question. The multiple choice selections for this question are names referencing the original list. \n\nMy question is this: should I bring this up to the person at the company I've been talking to up until this point? For context, I'm applying for a mid-level Software Developer position. I don't want it to seem like I'm sore from missing two questions but at the same time I feel like it might reflect well if I point out an error like this. (Additionally, I might have somehow guessed those two correctly and the two wrong weren't even related to this question. Or there's the 1% sliver of doubt which tells me there was a way to figure it out.)\n\nEDIT: I've gone ahead and sent an email to the recruiter letting them know I had a concern about the two questions, but not outright calling them a typo.

I am not really that interested in those languages but for some reason I am talking myself into thinking it wont be too bad due to the nature of interesting projects and might actually end up enjoying it but these are all unknowns.\n\n**Job B**: Its a graduate developer role working on data science projects using a modern stack, java 8, react things like that with a little spring. I am not that keen on data science though as I always hated AI / maths courses at uni. The stack is more my thing but my main issues are the job isn't as stable, pay is slightly less and since its my first developer job, I feel perhaps a graduate program is the better option for me here to build up my confidence slowly.\n\nI don't really feel like either job is exactly what I want, so ultimately right now pay and job security is mostly what it comes down to and the vibe I felt during the interview process. Its just really hard to decide and where I live there are not many opportunities.\n\nHas anyone else been in a similar situation?\n\n- how did you decide or narrow down choices such as a grad program or a graduate developer\n- how did it turn out?",

            "selftext": "Yesterday, I finished a contract for a company I managed to land some part time freelance with. The rates were 11 GBP an hour, as someone at 19, living with generalized anxiety disorder and mild depression due to a very traumatic 2 years I really needed some money to give me a bit of leeway.\n\nFor starters I desperately needed some upgrades, I needed a new SSD for my laptop and some more ram (android dev was a real pain on just 8GB) along with some networking equipment. I also wanted to put away some money for insurance on my first car which Im hoping to somehow afford at some point.\n\n**But to the question**:\n\nI have a business idea, I started on this product 3 years ago as a part of my learning and actually got a prototype web app of it and showed a few people I know in the industry and they all expressed interest in it and were very keen to find out more. \n\nI showed it to someone I know who owns a software dev company and he said it definitely had potential.\n\nOver those 3 years I began to realize my skill set needed improving to take this project where I invisioned it so I put development on pause and vowed to work on smaller projects to learn more about the topics I was struggling on.\n\nThis has worked very well and Im in the process of finishing off my first Android app/game (I've decided Android/iOS will be my primary platform for my business idea now) and releasing it to the Play store to give me some experience before working on my big idea.\n\nSo Im left wondering... Am I better off denying the next contract from this company to work on my business idea? It feels like a terrifying thing to do... Especially as Im getting paid, where as my business wont break even for a while (although I'm currently in talks with a trust for people in my situation who might be able to get me a grant) and Il be left with just what my parents can afford to give me.\n\nAll my life I've dreamt of developing an app and making a business out of it. At the moment, Im so excited about my skills being good enough to make apps that its literally keeping me awake at night. Theres so many ideas in my head I can barely keep calm.\n\nBut then the sensible side of me (or maybe not? lol) says that I should be cautious of taking such a risk... But then, surely now at 19 is the best time to take such a risk? I dont know.\n\nI've done market research, I know my competitors and what Im up against (1 app, extremely poor UX and UI, seriously lacking some crucial features etc) along with knowing my market as I've got first hand experience on the field.\n\nI just dont know what to do, I dont want to look back in 10 years time, working for a company and passing up my dream of running my own software company.",

I go to a \"top\" school that isn't necessarily known for their CS program.\n\nI'm afraid that, if I end up at a company with bad mentorship right after graduation, I'll be unemployable and totally fucked.\n\nI've had two internships before and each time I wasn't sure if I was doing very well. It seemed like other interns were doing better than me. However, I was paid well and given a return offer at my internship I recently finished. I like this company, and would be interested in returning, but I do believe this is an important time to explore other companies while I can.\n\nTherefore, I'm applying to other internships. I'm getting a decent amount of response but I feel for each company I can group their recruiting in one of two groups:\n\n* Insanely easy interviews, so easy I question how shitty their software engineers are\n* Insanely hard interviews, so hard I wonder how my peers do well in them/prep for them and still manage to find time to work on classwork.\n\n\nI'm afraid I'm already getting behind/being doomed to work at a shitty company. I think this is partially irrational because I do have two internship offers in hand...\n\nAny words of encouragement? Anecdotes? Am I alone on this?\n\n\nAs a side-question: Most companies interested in me are from the financial and fintech industries... I suspect this is because of my previous experience this summer (prop trading firm) + my college. Will I forever be pigeonholed as a fintech dev? Are fintech devs good enough to succeed at tech companies? Do I need to chill the fuck out?",

My response:\nA $3 billion dollar company and the leader in open source software. $107.00 on the Stock Market and only going to get bigger. And more important and vital as a threat to all enterprise software companies. The Big 4 force young grads to compete in the ultimate warrior activity: meritocracy. Few win, MANY lose. You think that's right? It isn't. Self serving, of course. It creates a false sense of entitlement. But the CS people of the world are never the popular crowd....so what makes this sad is this CS culture should unite en masse to show everyone else they were wrong. The ultimate victory. Yet what happens is Lord of the Flies. Sad. What they don't understand is we won....the last laugh. But they won't stop and see it, because it can never be enough. You feel me?

Since then I have been working as the sole developer at a slightly dev focused company (they have been starting to expanding their software).\n\nWhen I was in university getting my bachelors I got burnt out by the end so I decided to work for a bit before going for a masters. But now that I have been working for over a year I am not sure if it even makes sense to do this. The program I am looking at is 2 semesters full time studies and 2 semesters internship. It offers an optional focus on data science. It is at a tough school, the one where I did my undergrad so I know first hand how easy it is to get burnt out there. It really does seem interesting to me but I am confused as to whether it makes sense to go back to school at all.\n\nSo I guess my situation is that I am scared to do my masters because of my undergrad experience but I am also scared of not doing it because there are so many people coming into our field that I fear a masters will eventually be necessary to work as a dev. \n\nAny thoughts/help in this situation will be appreciated!",

I am 14 years old, with a great interest in 2 things; IT and Graphic design. (you can view my graphic design work at be.net/joelfreeman)\n\nI'm a huge fan of graphic design, although I also do love IT. I have some knowledge in programming (Specifically C#), some networking and a LOT about hardware. So here's my problem; I don't know what career to choose. I am very passionate about both, although I'm not really sure where to go from. I have 'networked' myself with many professional graphic designers, as well as people in the IT field (sysadmins, developers) so I do have great connections in both fields for the most part.\n\nIn New Zealand, the median salary for a Graphic Designer is around 49k NZD, or $35,970 USD. As far as IT salary's go, the median salary is $62,764 as a Software Developer (46,075.05 usd) or 58,579 (Median, again) as a Systems administrator (43,002.84 USD)\n\nThe reason I listed salary's for both careers is since I'd like to be financially comfortable. I don't want to be stressing over if my future partner and I are going to have enough money to provide for the kids. I want to live comfortably, and at the state of house prices rising in New Zealand, I'm not sure how that's going to work.\nWhatever career path I go down, I will most likely dedicate most of time into that, even while at school. (not while physically at school but in the weekdays eh actually I probably will do some stuff here and there)\n\nI just don't really know which path I should choose. I want to choose both; But I know I can't.\n\nCheers,\n\nJoel.\n\n(Sorry about the formatting!)\n\n",

I've worked at my school's IT help desk for 3 years and became an assistant documentation specialist last year (basically knowledge base management). 90% of job postings I see on LinkedIn or on companies' job postings, they demand 3-4 years' experience.

I do not have the aptitude to be a software engineer/developer; I can code, but nothing complex. It takes me forever to understand what's going on and even longer to finish a program, and it's not even written efficiently. I understand I won't receive the glamorous CS paycheck if I'm not a developer, but I just want to start *somewhere* and I liked my BA internship. I eventually want to get into Security, but I'll have to learn that on my own since my professor for data comm was garbage at teaching. So I guess I'm asking for advice? Most of the posts on here concerning BA career paths that I've seen, the person started as a developer and I'd like to avoid that if possible because I'd be horrible at it, and that's if I managed to land a position in the first place.\n\nEDIT: K, let me rephrase my actual question.

            "selftext": "tl;dr: I'm a Network \"Engineer\" someday I'd like to do work that is closer to CS. That possibly means being the guy that writes the applications that controls other people's networks. That could mean doing something completely unrelated to networking. I know that does not mean configuring networks through a web interface (or even through the CLI to be honest) and I have no idea if I'm on the correct path. I'd love to hear from people who made a similar career move. \n\n___\n\nI'm a mid level Network Engineer at a mid-sized enterprise and I'm primarily focused on Route/Switch and Wireless. I do a little bit of scripting, primarily with expect and a little bit of Python. I don't hate my job, but I'd like to move into a more technical role. \n\nMy biggest problem with Networking is that all it really consists of is following Cisco's best practices and letting TAC tell you what code version you need to move to when something doesn't work, or at best I get to find workarounds when we hit a limitation with a Cisco feature we are trying to implement. It feels like I do very little real engineering. Some times I'd like to just ignore Cisco recommendations so that network designs are truly my own, but in practice you have to follow these recommendations if you want a stable network and want to keep up with business needs. \n\nFor a long time I thought that I'd get to do more technical work as things like SDN mature, but I don't see that happening. I seriously doubt network engineers are going to do much with the APIs that Cisco and other vendors are building into their network gear. I think all the legwork is going to be done by Cisco, Infoblox, etc. This became painfully obvious to me when we first starting talking about doing CoA with ISE and the realization that while most networks are unique to some extent, it's really all just boilerplate. \n\nSomeday ISE or something like it will handle campus switchport configurations, ACI or something like it will handle datacenter routing and switchport configurations, iWAN or something similar will largely handle our WAN. While I think these applications won't necessarily be easy to set up, I really don't feel like I'll enjoy being the guy configuring these applications. \n\nI like the network, I think infrastructure is an interesting place to be, routing protocols interest me, switching interests me, but I'm happiest when I'm writing scripts. I seriously doubt that most network engineers will be writing custom applications to interact with their network in the future, but I'd like to somehow ensure that my job gets more technical and that I don't wind up spending the rest of my career configuring someone else's application that interfaces with my network. I'd rather be the guy writing the applications.\n\nWhat I've done to try to stay technical: \n\n* I picked up a minor in Computer Science when I decided to pursue an IT career\n* I script things when I can, but most of the scripts are simply manipulating show command output into something more useful\n* I have a few side projects that I'm working on in python\n* I've been retaking math courses I took early on during my bachelors with the intention to actually learn the math this time. I only took through pre-cal in college and am currently taking pre-cal through a local community college. I intend to take math through linear algebra and then apply to Georgia Tech's OMSCS\n* I'm also working on my CCNP because, networking does pay pretty well and I can't imagine it will hurt my career if I get it. I also don't want to let my CCNA lapse\n\nSometimes it feels like I'm just spinning my wheels and that I'll wind up in a field that I no longer like. Am I going about this the wrong way? Could I be doing more? Am I doing to much? I'd love to hear from people that have made a similar career move. ",

I graduated recently with no projects, no internships, no work experience, and a very low GPA (< 2.5). In retrospect I pretty much wasted the majority of my time at my university, and other than some damn good friends and a degree in CS don't have much to show for it. I read through most of that thread and got a lot of insight out of it, big thank you to all those who posted in that thread by the way.\n\nThe top comment on that post said that I shouldn't look for a job not related to programming for my first job. However my family have been pressuring me to apply for other jobs other than programming, like in retail or being a restaurant server, mostly because I've never had a (real) job and they think I lack a lot of soft skills needed for a *real* job. I'm not in a bad financial situation so I don't have a need to have any job immediately to survive, and my parents make enough money to support me, but I don't want to stay unemployed and want to be independent from them. I think they also just want me to get a job as soon as possible regardless of what it is, because any job is better than being unemployed and it's also work experience. Also between me and you guys, I think they just don't like the idea of me sitting at home on my ass even if I am trying to be productive learning and applying for jobs.\n\nI don't blame them honestly, I've admittedly always been very lazy, and despite me trying to be serious about finding a job I really haven't been serious, at least compared to many of the experiences I've read on this thread. I've been working on setting my mentality straight as much as I've been teaching myself skills I should've already learned through an internship and trying to apply for jobs. Anyway that's enough rambling on my part. What do you guys think? Should I look for and take a non-programming job for my first job? If not, how should I talk to my family about this and convince them that I shouldn't take just any job right now?\n\nThank you for reading all or any of that if you've gotten this far, and I appreciate any comment even if it's blunt criticism chewing me out.",

Now aged 26, is it too late to take another Bachelor's in CS/Software and do it all over again for a better outcome?**\n\n---\n\n *   In 2011, I chose Mech Eng at McGill over Software Eng Co-Op at Concordia (both offered). cuz I thought you would need to be already a genius coder to excel in a CS major. I also thought I would want to do Master's or even PhD in biomimetics/prothestics related field.\n\n*    I was so blind to what it really means to be an excelling undergrad. All I ever did during school was going to class. I got A's but it was all from cramming. I was not passionate enough about any particular sub-field to specilize towards. I knew just enough to do okay in exams (3.83 CGPA).\n\n*    When I graduated in 2015, I had bsolutely no interest in keep on going to school. But I had no internship experience (fucked up the FIRST and ONLY internship interview I ever got with CN). No leadership experience. No engineering student team experience. No connections. No extracurricular at all. My GPA meant nothing. I even got interviewed in the final round at Bell for a new-grad program, but got rejected for not having the right technical background.\n\n*    Naturally by 2017, I have had zero actual engineering jobs despite the countless job applcations. I have worked at Tim's to keep busy at minimal wage, I have worked at a third-party cusomter tech support place at 11.5/hr. I have worked at pricy summer coding camps as a glorified daycarer for rich kids. Absolute garbage jobs and felt like garbage. Shameful to be the only one with a STEM degree at work place. I had to live at my parent's rent-free to pay off my student loans.\n\n*    Now I am almost 26, and managed to be in a non-thesis Master's Degree in Biomedical Engineering at UBC. And it's killing me! I am not even SUPER passionate about the biomedical field. I only did it because it promised co-op internships and my uni GF is back in Vancouver. Problem is, I see now this degree is so NOT in demand in Canada in the private sector. High chance that I will get no useful internship from it.  I can only see myself being in the exact same position when I gradaute again. I am stressed out everyday about my future, on top of the heavy course load.\n\n*    I see my friends in Software or CS have all had smooth sailing with internships and jobs. One had no coding experience before going into a Software major and now has a good dev job as team lead. This field was always my other choice. I know I can learnd to code. But I also know I can't simply switch career path on my own. I will need to take on another Bachelor's again. Maybe at McGill in Software, or at concordia in CS. It would be a second chance for me. I would work hard this time, do more than just going to classes, and graduate with internships and extracurricular .\n\n*    **Here's the question: I am turning 26 in Dec. I would perhaps finish my 1-year Master's which ends in August 2018. If I choose to start another 4-year Bachelor's in Sept 2018, 7 years after my fist one, is it too late for me? Would I look like an old idiot to employers?**\n",

Otherwise my coursework was focused in Java so that's my most comfortable language, following that is JS, HTML, CSS (&SCSS) as well as Adobe Photoshop. What I'd love most is to be a full stack developer. \n\nOh and I also happen to be painfully anxious the majority of the time and this is only amplified in settings such as career fairs with crowds of people wearing suits.

For about 2 1/2 years they've had me working full time in one of their medium sized school districts as a level 2 tech.\nAs far as my experience goes, I've been here 2 1/2 years, before that, I worked as an in store Geek Squad repair agent in college for 3 years. I have B.S. in Computer Science. I'm in the most senior position at the district, aside from the Tech Director who is a former teacher mostly in charge of large scale decisions and budgeting, and rely on me to handle anything technical.\n\nI handle setting up servers, backups, writing powershell scripts to automate as much as I can, configuring group policy, manage print servers. When my company came to the district, they were 15 years behind in terms of their technology. I configured a WSUS, Domain Controller, DHCP server, Windows Print Server, Set up classroom file shares with proper permissions, Personal Home drives for all students and staff members and plenty of other application servers on VMs at their request.\n\nThe only things I am uncomfortable with is configuring cisco switches, I can do the simple things like change the VLAN on a port or check port status, but that's about as far as I can go. I'm unfamiliar with setting up a VMWare ESX server, since that was done by my company's sys admin who is no longer with us, but I'm confident with some documentation I could figure it out, since I have some experience with Linux from my college days.\nRight now, I only need to escalate something higher to our company leadership if there is something wrong with our Cisco equipment, which then gets contracted out to network engineers who take care of the issue.\n\nMy main concern is that I don't know what my next career move should be or even what other positions I am qualified for, I feel that I am underpaid right now for my skill set, and that there is no where else for me to go within my company. I'm not interested in management. Inside my company, I have the same level of knowledge as everyone else, as anything I can't handle gets passed on to an outside contractor. I don't even know what positions outside my company I would qualify for and what to apply to. System Admin? I don't know as much as a feel I should about networking or cisco equipment and I don't have any certs.\n\nI do have a CS degree, and would take a programming job, but I'm only writing scripts occasionally now, and don't know if I could even leverage that experience. I had a low GPA in college and other than scripting for my current job, haven't done any coding since college.\n\nAny help is greatly appreciated, thank you.",

            "selftext": "So some background: I went to a smaller university (about 10k students) and graduated in spring 2016 with a degree in CS. I got my first job right out of college because I was referred to by my chair. Basically the company wanted someone graduate with experience in Info sec as they had a position open for someone at a entry level salary. I did alot of security stuff in college from research to competing I  CTFs and had a good relationship with our chair that I was the first person he asked about this position. Well now I work in Vulnerability management and all the penetration testers are on my team so I work with them and learn more everyday. \n\n\nThe problem is my coworkers are very..... aggressive. I don't hate them at all. In fact they are really cool people. But being in Info sec right out of college has made me kind of the baby of the department. I'm 25 and the next closest age on my team is my manager who is 40 and in the department is 33. So I kinda get picked on by my hacker coworkers. I usually fire back with something like \"don't make me go to HR\" And they'll usually pull out a golf club and say \"you got to make it to the car first\". They also call me a millennial, young and dumb (which I am young and don't know near as much as they do). They basically make me the bitch of the team and they even say it. \n\n\nLike I said, it doesn't bother me. I know it's all jokes and I'm pretty thick skinned. They are all willing to teach me anything and are pretty caring actually. I'm just curious if anyone else has had this experience before?\n\n\nTLDR: Coworkers pick on me all the time but at the same time are great at teaching me things and actually care. Has anyone ever experienced this?",

I got an Astronomy BS with a Mathematics minor, but wasn't drawn to the \"expected\" path for those in a similar spot, which would be a PhD and a path through academia. I was instead drawn to computational astronomy and participated in research in that discipline, and in my spare time got involved with a small group doing web development for a startup. I did take CS courses, but that was earlier on in my studies before higher level courses in my main areas kind of crowded them out.\n\nSo, going in, I feel like my main strengths are adaptability and experience in programming in a research as well as a customer-oriented setting. The Astronomy/Physics/Math background will also help serve as a basis for coming up with solutions. \n\nBut I feel my weakness is that I'm coming in from sort of the opposite direction as the expected candidate, if you will - another candidate will probably have a deeper level of experience with programming but be less versed in some of the math and physics behind the problems posed to them, while I am very comfortable with the math and physics but I'll need to work at becoming more quick/clean when it comes to finding the ideal implementation of those concepts in code.\n\nWhat kind of stuff do you think I general I should expect from a ~30 minute telephone interview (I'll get an in-person if I do well) for a software engineering position? What suggestions would you have for best emphasizing my strengths? My plan is to first just make sure I'm all good to go on communicating the core concepts of my preferred languages (C, Java, Javascript, HTML, CSS but probably will need to focus on the first two), then try to figure out how I want to sell the angle at which I'm coming into the field.",

When I started I was just a young guy straight out of university ready to go into any job that would take me and this place seemed fun and I gfot along with the people there.\n\nDuring my time there I worked on VB.Net, VB6, SQL Server and some other languages which were very situational.\n\nDuring my time there the coding standards where very informal. We weren't following any design patterns; it was more of a \"create a solution to solve this problem.\"\n\nAnyway not too long ago I was made redundant from this job.  Shortly after this I got a job in another company; once again very similar working not for a software company but a company known for other things.  I was just in the role of creating/maintaining software that helped the business.\n\nThe thing is I don't like this job; it's a hot-desk environment and the authorisation required to do work is excessive to the point that a lot of what we do is not making things more secure but really just authorisation for the sake of authorisation.\n\nSo I've been looking around at other jobs.  I had an interview with a software development company and the feedback I got has kind of stuck with me.\n\nWhile I have good problem solving skills and real world experience and can create whatever is needed to resolve a problem; the problem is that I lack the knowledge/experience of implementing design patterns in my code.  This was something that was second nature to me in university but as my time commercially has developed I've forgotten this and grown into the habit of this informal design methodology that has been asked of me.\n\nMy concern now is I've pigeon-holed myself into this situation now and risk not being able to get a job a couple of years in the future if I get made redundant again.\n\nI'm just not sure now if maybe I should take a pay cut and start lower in a software development company in order to get these skills back up and develop commercial experience using them?  Or if I should stick to the path I'm on now which has so far not put me in a situation where I don't have a job and don't have job offers made towards me.",

            "selftext": "Hi all, I'm a BSc computer science engineering student from Hungary who plans to stay in Europe (but not necessarily Hungary) after graduation. At my uni they offer three specializations, and I have to choose soon but I'm not sure which I should choose.\n\nThey offer intelligent systems and robotics, application development, and network administration. Taking the robotics would allow me to graduate at least a semester earlier (3 years instead of 3,5, meaning I can start my masters a year earlier). The other two would be much more difficult to graduate early with.\n\nAs far as my interests, I enjoy the programming I have done, which has been mostly in C and a tiny bit of Python. I did robotics as a programmer in school and loved it. Within CS I am mainly interested in AI, computational linguistics, and computational neuroscience. Although my math skills need quite a bit of improvement, same with physics. I'm not very interested in front end development. Otherwise I'm not sure where I want to end up career wise.\n\nDo you have any advice for how I can figure out what to choose, and which specialization would be more useful? Which one has a broader range of possibilities for career choices/uses?",

Long story short, I'm not a citizen or a green card holder in the US, and I'm ineligible for employment. I was actually offered an IT internship this summer (summer of 2017), but was unable to accept it because of USCIS's mistakes (they overlooked a federal precedent that essentially should've approved my GC; happened to like 600,000 other people). It looks like until this issue is resolved, which is hopefully before the end of this year (according to my lawyer), I won't even be able to look for an internship. So, my questions are:\n\n1) In the best case, my GC and employment should be available by the end of this year (hopefully mid-Nov). I'm going to be staying an extra semester due to a late change of academic plans. Will I still be able to look for summer internships as a senior who'd be returning to school for a 9th semester?\n\n2) In the worst case, which honestly isn't even that farfetched considering how slowly USCIS works, my GC might not be approved until mid-March to May next year. At this point, it'd be too late to look for an internship. What are my options then?\n\nI know this is a strange situation, but I'd love any advice that I can use to hopefully avoid being the \"recent grad with 0 experience\" with a low-mediocre GPA (almost exactly 3.0; UD coursework is like 3.2-3.3 though). Thanks for your time.\n\nP.S. I considered unpaid internships as well. I'm not allowed to take these either, because it's potential employment. In other words, I'd be doing paid work for free that COULD go to an American.",

But, I would be lacking in strong programming knowledge (I only really know Python, R, and Matlab). \n\n2) Concentrate on Machine Learning (CS minor in the process)\nThis is the path I'd prefer. This would lead me to courses in convex optimization, efficient algorithms, time series, an advanced UG/introductory graduate level of ML, and low-level programming. However, I heard that to be really able to work on ML in industry, you need a MS. Grad school isn't a viable option for me for awhile due to money and other personal issues. So, as much as I'd prefer this route, it seems like just \"dipping my toe\" in the field.\n\n3) Concentrate on \"Industry\" programming (CS minor as well)\nThis is the route I prefer the least, but the most practical and viable. This route would lead to courses in low-level programming, OS and systems programming, potentially Internet architecture (if I can even get into the class, since it's so popular), and efficient algorithms. It seems this is the most \"applicable\" path to take, but it isn't something I'd necessarily enjoy.\n\nFor those working in CS/tech, what option do you think is the best for me, realistically?

I did okay on the other interviews but I was 99% sure I would be rejected. \n\nOn the first day of the internship with the start-up, the CTO welcomed all of the interns. He talked about how they gave less than 1% of applicants offers and how we were the cream of the crop. I still remember hearing that and cringing, because i know SO many more qualified and smart people who didn't get that job, with my above-average ass taking their spot.\n\nTo further confirm my doubts, I didn't receive a return offer from the start-up. I received one from the Big-4 but that's because my project wasn't that hard, I just worked hard and delivered at the end.\n\nAnd recently I've been interviewing for FT positions as well. Recently had an on-site with another good firm. Again, bombed one of the interviews, came out of it thinking I had no chance at an offer. When I say bombed I don't mean the interviewer had to give me hints to finish, I straight up didn't finish a problem again. But then I get the offer a few days later. What the heck is going on?? Is it just because i have the names on my resume now? Do people just trust that I'd be a good employee?\n\nI was recently discussing some interview questions with a less-successful friend of mine. He's interned at some crappier companies, striking out at Big-4s and Unicorns. He's absolutely better than me at algorithms - he's actually able to solve problems on the spot. So it got me down thinking I'm just a big fat phony who's lucked his way through internships. It's been bothering me and makes me kind of sad. Hopefully it's just temporary as it's been on my mind for the last few days.\n\n",

            "selftext": "At my last job, I had an absolutely adamant boss who demanded that a particular feature be coded incorrectly. When the developers justified the correct way, we were literally met with, \"Just do it and drop the issue.\" It was an absolute wall to fight back against, and it made the job tedious, and I felt dirty just coding it. The worst feeling of all was not understanding why it had to be done that way.\n\nI have a particularly OCD issue with coding. I break every programming concept down into its smallest parts so that I completely grasp what is happening, then build it back up in the most optimal way. One of my strongest suits is micro-optimization, but it makes inefficient code unbearable to look at. That's what I'm trying to work on.\n\nI recently moved to a new job, and the assignment was \"Do it however you see fit, we'll be pretty hands off.\" That was great for me, as I got to ensure each feature was polished and optimized.\n\nAnd it went well, until today, when they said that we have to use unoptimized code. Specifically, we _have_ to repeat strings in a database. We have a table of (id, string) e.g. (1, \"one\"), (2, \"two\"), (3, \"three\"), and a table referencing those values. This second table is (other, id, string), such as (\"anything\", 1, \"one\"), (\"something\", 2, \"two\"), (\"something else\", 1, \"one\").\n\nYou should be able to see that it should just be (\"anything\", 1) and (\"something\", 2). But it's not. And the higher ups have _demanded_ that it stay that way.\n\nFurthermore, the strings are self-reported, so a user can 'maliciously' submit whatever they want, e.g. (\"anything\", 1, \"three\"). We can't even have the user submit 1 and query the string \"one\" before inserting it to a) minimize what the user submits and b) prevent incongruent data.\n\nHow do I just accept this order from my superiors? Explaining optimal choices is met with \"do it anyway,\" and while they have better reasoning than my last employer (in this case, compatibility with legacy systems that were coded like shit but have other software relying on it), I would like to at least use a middleware to convert our good code to their bad, legacy code. That way, if the bad code is ever erased, we don't need to rewrite our entire system either.\n\nI don't know. I just don't know how to deal with bad coding. I am so used to being a solo programmer that working on a team is proving difficult, especially against my OCD.\n\nI want to improve, and I don't want to be a rogue or argumentative. It's a new job, and I haven't exactly proven myself as a contributor that I can just tell my boss that they're wrong and stubbornly push _my_ way of doing things.\n\nI need some mental gymnastics here. I want to be a better team player, and this seems to be a repetitive issue across any job. How do I deal with it? How do I put team player ahead of good programmer?\n\nThanks,",

I've self-learned most of my programming skills (the electrical and software portions of my degree don't come until later), and my past experiences have all been mechanical though.\n\nTaking a look through job boards and articles, seems like my best bets are in Data Science, Embedded Systems, and Test Automation. Of these three, Embedded Systems appeals to me the most, and is also the most aligned with my skill-set. What should I do to improve my chances of being hired? Although it's my first software internship, it's also the last internship of my degree..\n\nThings that I've thought of so far:\n\n* Learn Computer Architecture via classes like Nand2Tetris\n* Learn basic Networking principles\n* Upgrade my Machine Learning skills with projects or classes\n\nMy skills:\n\n* Novice level understanding of Machine Learning via Andrew Ng's course\n* Number of microcontroller DIY projects with the most complicated being a Rubik's cube solver\n* Novice level understanding of Front-End Web Dev via completion of FreeCodeCamp's certification\n* Novice level understanding of programming fundamentals via completion of CS50\n\nThanks a lot for any advice you guys have to offer",

Computer science has always been a passion of mine and I'm ready to pursue it as a career.\n\nHaving said that, I would like to get into a good school because I want a strong education and better career opportunities. I know many here will say your school doesn't matter much, but I figure if the government is paying for my education (GI Bill from military service) I might as well go to a good school even if it's costly, since I don't have to worry about student debt.\n\nMy dilemma is currently I highly doubt I could get into a good school with my poor high school grades. So I am thinking the best option is to attend community college for 2 years, work my ass off, then transfer. UC Berkeley right now is my top choice, so I think I would go to a California CC such as De Anza and make sure I take the necessary courses to transfer. This would also put me in a good position to get into other decent CA schools such as UC Davis if I don't get accepted into Berekely.\n\nDoes this sound like a smart plan? There are other schools I'd consider such as University of Austin, Texas but since Berkeley is my top choice it seems attending CC in CA is my best option.\n\nAlso, any other general tips for getting accepted as a transfer to a good schoo, besides earning a high GPA? I'm hoping my veteran status, varied life experiences and side projects will give me an edge as well, but I don't know.\n\nAny advice is greatly appreciated, thank you!",

Have opportunity for undergrad position in Data Mining, but main focus has been software engineering, with only minor interest in Data Science. Should I pursue this opportunity or look for experience in software engineering instead?\n\nMy Background: I'm a Junior CS student at the moment in Southern California. I have no internships yet and some minor professional experience in front-end web for a small E-Commerce business and that's it. My first couple years I did not do very well in classes, but this past year I have kicked it up a notch and have been excelling in upper division CS classes, trying to rebuild my GPA.\n\n**Recently I was emailed by a previous TA about an undergrad position on her team for data mining/data science, with the goal of eventually interning or getting a job with some company/agency in the field afterwards.** If I can somehow get the position with my GPA, it sounds like an exciting opportunity. **However, while the subject is interesting, for the past few months I've been focusing on software engineering and plan to do my senior design project in that subject. Meanwhile, data science was not really on my radar, and to be honest, I'm not sure that I have the math chops that I think I need for it, because I never excelled math courses I took in the earlier days**\n (due to personal problems and lack of effort, not lack of ability). I also have no plans for pursuing a masters or PhD, which I have read is pretty necessary to do real work in data science anyway.\n\n**As of right now, I plan on following up and trying to get the position, because I feel like I would be a fool not to get experience like this.** However, I worry that if I don't like it or can't keep up with the math, I'll be stuck in it for awhile, with no time to actually get better at software engineering, which was my plan all along. I do have an interest in data science as well, but I guess lack of knowledge in the area (and therefore lack of confidence) is making me worried, that I should instead pursue opportunities in software engineering or similar fields, even though nothing is guaranteed.\n\n**What are your opinions on the matter? Should I pursue this opportunity (and any that I possibly can, no matter the field) or look for experience in \"my field\" instead?** This can also be a general question: should students pursue any possible opportunities, or only go after that one field they really want to do, at the cost of losing possible experience and resume entries?\n\nThanks for reading and offering any advice you can!\n\n**Bonus questions:** Is data mining as math heavy as I am led to believe? Will I be out of my league if my math foundations aren't as solid as they could be? I am scheduled to take an Intro Machine Learning/Data Mining course in the fall, so that's good timing. I just have a feeling that I'll be in over my head in something that I'm not good at. I don't have any details of the role yet unfortunately. ",

Our team is very understaffed, we would need around 2 to 3 new people to get the weekly work done in time (not to speak about having 1 or 2 more to actually have time for taking a breath now and then...). \n\nWhen I started at that company 2 years ago they didnt had a CI-System, we still have no test-system, we still have a lot of blocked websites for our company (e.g. imgur, youtube) and so on - so not the best package, but we try to move on.\n\nSo while we are trying to make the best out of the situation (and our bosses are okay with a lot of ideas we usualy come up with) our teamleaders today decided to agree to a new rule within all teams:\n\n- Nobody cares about your documentation / comments in your actual code\n- you have to have a comment for every method, property and class (summarys)\n- you are not allowed to comment in english, just in german\n- quote: \"I dont care whatever your comment for a method is, just comment every method without help of a tool, e.g. GhostDoc\"\n- if not, there will be consequnces\n- it will be checked in code reviews\n\nFor me, this is completly the hell - I don't give a fck for method summarys and GhostDoc is my friend, because when I write my method, I care about:\n- a very good inline commenting\n- a documentation file about this assambly / module I work on\n- a good commenting / documentation in our ticket system (which is linked nearly in every system our company has)\n- sometimes a email to my team here and then whenever I make big changes\n\nAll these points are \"not valid\" for my teamleader(s), they just don't care - and this reached a point in which I can't go to work and ignore that I spend 1 hour to acutally document my work each day with comments, files, tickets and so on - but will get problems when I forgot my method header - and my coworker just makes a good header and didn't write a single inline comment in his fcking 1000 lines of code in this method.

Our IT department is only me, my supervisor, and two other techs. I've been here for about a year and a half and it's my first actual job in my career field as I'm still in school. I've worked summer internships and done the occasional work for a small start up company here and there, but nothing serious. \n\nI'm making $10/hr here and was working full time during this past summer. When my one year mark hit I thought it was time for me to ask for a raise as my job responsibilities have grown a lot since I started and I thought it'd be fair to get an increase in compensation for increased workload. We just hired our fourth member of the IT department and I'm the one training him and he makes $21/hr,  but he has 10-15 years experience and has a degree. That's another reason I wanted a raise since I'm training someone who's making double what I am. \n\nSo I asked my supervisor for a raise and she said that she's been very proud of my work and progress especially in the last few months so I thought I had a good shot. Two weeks pass and I haven't heard anything so I pop in her office and ask if she's heard anything about what we discussed and she said it's been to busy and hasn't heard anything. I was okay with that because we are busy with projects right now. The week after that she calls me into her office and doesn't say anything about the raise, but says the higher ups say I need to work part-time (29 hours MAX) while school is in session. She said she tried very hard on my behalf and I told her I understood and went back to my work. \n\nNow I've never had a complaint from any of our users, always complete my projects on time, and worked my school schedule around working 40 hours here. It's very discouraging and I don't know what to do now. There's not a lot of IT jobs around here for people without a degree and I want this job for resume purposes, but I have no motivation to continue working here after this.

Since coming back, I have felt better, but the work isn't as rewarding. \n\nI am wondering if it was the work that I didn't like, or just the environment. I know it's not a question that anyone but myself can probably answer, but do any of you guys have some personal metrics you go by? I like programming (c#, Java, and some SQL) but I was mainly just fixing bugs, and regardless of how difficult or easy each fix was, the \"reward\" or satisfaction was all the same. That kinda lead to a monotony, and coupled with working remotely for a team that hardly ever spoke to each other, even during critical down times, I decided to leave. \n\nTL;DR: I am wondering if you guys have ways of judging if your satisfaction, or dissatisfaction, stems more from the work you do, or where you do it (environment vs programming in general)?\n\nAgain, thanks all.

I'm very interested in algorithms and programming but I'm very confused how to do research in computer science. As I'm in the business school's methodology course they talk about getting research data through interviews, observation, questionnaires and the like. I just can't come up with an interesting hard-boiled computer science topic for me that would utilise these methods. \n\n\nWhat is data usually like in computer science research and what are some ways of gathering it? We cannot just do a literature review. We have to gather something that we can analyse and draw conclusions from.\n\n\nFeel free to shoot me some topic ideas in the intersection of compsci and accounting. I'd like it to be as much compsci as possible. I recently got interested in genetic algorithms, I like programming; the topic could also be security related.",

            "selftext": "A little background here: I'm a rising junior majoring in CS and up until this point the sequence of programming languages my school has  taught in its curriculum is Python->C. I do know the final semester classes will slowly transition into C++ and I think there might be one class on Java in the 300 to 400 level classes.\n\nDown to the reason behind this question. I've been applying to countless internships, big companies, small companies, tech, non-tech and I've seen a constant recurring theme in the list of qualities for \"preferred candidates\": experience in C++ and/or Java. Although not every single internship required this, many (if not most) were looking for students who had exposure to these languages. \n\nI just feel like my University is impeding us students by focusing so heavily on a language such as C. I understand that knowing C lets you really learn the \"low-level stuff\" but frankly it seems that recruiters don't give half a shit that I can tell you a switch statement uses less resources than an if statement. Most of them are so far up and beyond that simple stuff that they want to know how good you are at OOP.\n\nIs it not possible to learn all these low-level mechanisms through a language like C++ or Java as well? I don't know, I'm just wondering what everyone else's experience is/was at their university because I was honestly thinking of writing a letter to the department of CS to voice my opinion (not that it matters for me at this point but at least future students might not get the short end of the stick).\n\nAlso, I'm not saying I did not receive any internships, in fact I had one last summer for a big healthcare company (although the job dealt more with data analysis and data science rather than programming) but in the realm of software development, it seems like candidates with an extra 2 \"+'s\" after the letter C on their resume have a better chance of landing these software dev internships.\n\nWhat are you thoughts/experiences?",

            "selftext": "Sorry for the slightly vague title, but I'll expand upon my situation and ask for some advice.\n\nI graduated from a top school in computer science in 2011. I did a summer internship straight after graduation.  The internship was only 2 months, but I felt like it was broadly successful.  \n\nI then did another year of study, unrelated to computer science or software engineering.  It was a bit of a hobby and I was thinking about careers at all.  \n\nIn 2013 I landed my first software job doing some Java development part time at a startup.  I knew I didn't have much experience and I struggled a bit.  I didn't really make much of a contribution to the main project, but I made some small tools and scripts which helped other people do their jobs more effectively so I think that was a plus.  Unfortunately the startup ran out of money, couldn't make payroll and so I jumped out after 2 months no pay (they did pay me eventually). I was there about 6 months.\n\nAfter that I worked odd jobs to make ends meet and taught myself ruby on rails.  I read a lot of hacker news and startup related books.  To be honest, I had a starry eyed dream of starting my own company and making my own product, but I never managed to release my prototype.  \n\nAfter 6 months of doing odd jobs I landed a full time ruby on rails job.  It was another startup.  It was far far more difficult than I thought it would be.  The project seemed massive and unlike anything I had seen before working on my toy projects and tutorials.  The lead programmer was remote and I found communication difficult.  In the 6 months I worked there full time I don't think I wrote any code that made it into the main codebase.  I did a few bits and bobs like sales events and deployment, but me and the boss came to a mutual agreement that it would be better if I left.  I don't want to waste a startup's money if I'm not able to do anything for them.\n\nFast forward through a year and a half of more odd jobs.  I studied react and react native in this time.  I made a bunch of different prototypes for things that I'm interested in.  I got another part time job programming for a machine learning startup.  I don't understand any of the machine learning things but their frontend is react so I thought there would be at least something I could do there.\n\nSo I'm two months into this latest gig and I don't think things are going well.  I feel completely swamped.  I try reading the code-base and the documentation. In two months I've only made a few superficial changes, and most of the time I cannot build the main project on my dev machine.  I feel like I'm falling into the same problems I had on my previous project.  I find it very very hard to concentrate on anything at work right now.  I try to write lists of what I'm supposed to do the next day but it feels like a brick wall.  I tried doing pomodoro but I couldn't make it through a 20 minute block without getting distracted.  I'm very worried about my career.\n\nSo, after that backstory/braindump I have some more concrete questions:\n\nHow can I tackle coming into a new company and make it smoother? How do I get productive on a new codebase?\n\nHow can I improve my concentration and stay on task more in the face of difficulty?  \n\nPerhaps if programming is not my strong point, what other careers can I aim for?\n\nHow can I best explain the gaps and short tenures on my resume to a new employer?",

I'm doing quite well at school (not as good as to get into Cambridge or Oxford) and I think that I should have a chance to get into universities like Warwick, Manchester... So which university in the UK woudl be the best for computer science studies right now?\n2. Which degree would be the best choice? Should I focus and choose software engineering, artifficial intelligence, mathematics. Which one is the best? (Maybe someone with some experience could tell how much of a diferrence there is between these courses and what is it like to study each one of them)\n\n3. What does the typical day of a computer science student look like? What do you do during classes? How much free time do you have? Is it very hard and tiring? Etc.\n\n4. Finally, I want to ask what is the most important thing to know before starting the studies? And what would increase the chances to get into university (should I have some specific CS skills, should I have developed something already, should I have participated in some contests and so on...)?\n\nThank you!",

I was told i will be helping create internal apps and i'm known as the \"mobile guy\" but against my recommendation, i'm now writing hybrid apps using cordova/ionic. I'm basically a web developer which is something i am not interested in at all.\n\nI know web languages are a must know and i am obviously not going against the grain with that one, but we are using it inappropriately, the project we are working on is entirely internal and doesn't reach the public, it is all about performance(scanning and uploading data). I did around 70% of the project in a week before we even started, using native, showed that to the project leader and he basically dismissed it. It has taken three of us almost a month now to get about two thirds to where i was at with my native demo. As i was saying about learning web, i realize learning web is obviously only going to help me and i normally would accept it if it was required, but i am being forced to learn it to use it in a situation where i'm troubleshooting stuff that i have no issue with in native. It's taken us literal days to fix some of the relatively small issues we've encountered that aren't issues at all in native.\n\nA few bits about me, I'm a junior, I've been in this position for a few months now. I want to be a (native) app developer or a java developer at this point. I'm 25 years old.\n\nA few bits about the company i work for: It's a retail company, no one else knows how to do anything mobile there, especially not native. The project leader initially wanted us to create a bunch of html pages and run it from the browser on this device through the local host, i told him flat out that that will simply not work.\n\nMy questions are:\n\n1) Do i leave? I mean, i do not want to be a web developer, i have very little interest in it and i thought to myself after i finished university that i will never become a web developer as it would put me off development work altogether, i know i have to dabble in it and won't be able to escape it entirely but right now i am only touching web languages and that is it. I don't want to get 6 months down the track and have the majority of my dev experience be in web development.\n\n2) Am i overreacting a bit? I don't know enough about other companies and what they make their developers do to know if this is just part of the job or if i'm being forced into web dev.\n\n3) How would you go about this situation?\n\nAny advice would be great, i'm just at my wits end as i was so enthusiastic and happy to start developing but now I've done a complete 180 and hate going into work every day because i know i'll have to deal with some bullshit issue because of someone over-complicating things for no reason. Our development environment doesn't help as well because i keep mentally comparing it to android studio which has this clean layout and works perfectly with the emulator. Currently we use myeclipse to write, android studio to monitor the emulator + device, cmd to compile and run it and browser to debug!(I know right). ",

Next semester, I would be learning advanced Econometrics (time series, regression, game theory, and big data forecasting) and multivariate calculus. I think programming is really fun. I'm at a turning point in my college career where I am not sure whether or not my degree is useful (Econometrics has some programming and technical knowledge required). \n\nI'm particularly looking at software engineering and data science careers but data science seems to be more tedious than software engineering. In addition, I think data science roles are not very common for early stage startups or even older startups. My goal is to learn as much as possible. \n\nOptions I have been thinking about include dropping out to do a coding or data science bootcamp, switching majors to CS, math, or physics, working at a startup after graduating, or moving to silicon valley area. What would you guys recommend? \n\nThank you for any advice in advance!",

The salary seems pretty middle of the road which I'm happy with considering my qualifications. I have to move about 1600 miles across the country for the job and they are aware that I need to relocate. In the initial benefits/employee agreement/job offer letter they don't mention anything about relocation assistance. Is it fair for me to ask for relocation assistance? I would definitely have trouble making the move with only the money I have on me now. I could probably do it, but I definitely had expected some sort of relocation assistance. Does anyone have any recommendations on how to go about asking for something like that? I've never done this before. Maybe it's just not the way things work.

Can i become great fast enough? Will I be able to keep writing code (because lots of infosec is not about writing code). Distributed services certainly has lots of code.\n\nSEO / internet marketing feels like I am just walking down the street finding money.

A little about the job, its a small firm working in a warehouse where we image computers for the school district. A normal day goes like this: unpack boxes set up 5-10 computers, change bios settings, load image, install programs, with some occasional troubleshooting. This is my first job in 'IT' my previous job being working at a grocery market. We get paid about 12.50, the work is really easy and theres really no room for growth. The only real thing I see myself learning here is the various aspects of troubleshooting. \n\nMy initial plan was to quit and continue school and maybe go back to my grocery job. However I'm torn because a PC technician sounds far better on my resume than grocery worker but I could see the job clashing with my schooling. So should I stick it out and brave the 7-4 work week with the 6-10 night classes? Is this job really worth it for the resume buffer? I've been here 3 months and if cal poly wasn't so far away from dtla then this would be no problem, but unfortunately thats not the case. I'm just looking for some insight on whether this job is worth the trouble while attending school. \n\nSince were getting paid a little above minimum wage i don't mind working somewhere part time that is not in IT. However, I'm not sure how hiring managers will look at my switch from grocery to pc tech back to grocery on resume. \n\nThank you! ",

You do quite well on the tech screen, but not out-of-this world amazing. Will a company ever decide something like \"okay, they're good, but not worth X dollar amount.

Like many here, I'm going through a rough patch with my career path, which hopefully shouldn't be all too uncommon. \n\nI had an internship doing automated testing during my third year of school. But after maybe 6 months, they suddenly decided to cut a bunch of interns, including one who had been there about 3 years (I guess he was hired as a freshman in college or something).\n\nI've noticed a pretty strong pattern with my graduating class - all of the SWE jobs I've heard of people getting came directly after an internship. I don't have a large sample size as it were, but nevertheless that's compelling to me. \n\nAs for me, after college, I got a contract QA position that I was very unsatisfied with and left in 5 months. That's not at all what I was planning or expecting.\n\nSo given all of that, is getting a Software Engineering internship a feasible and good idea?\n\nI have more to say, but I don't want to write a novel that would discourage responses. I'm actually having a lot of emotional problems right now. And so, I'd love to a long chat about this with someone older and wiser; feel free to send a message.",

This recognition will be based off the individual's comment karma in the CSCareerQuestions subreddit. \n\n## What does this mean for how my flair will look?\n\nYou will still be able to write anything you want in the your flair. Our changes affect **the color of the flair only**. \n\nGoing forward, if you have reached a certain amount of comment karma in CSCareerQuestions, you can tell us and we will color your flair appropriately.

The gradient should provide a nice easy cue of a person's contributions to the subreddit (darker is more!). I will also make a point to add something like this to the sidebar for easy reference.\n\n## How do I get a cool, colored flair?\n\nThis is the process:\n\nSome of you may have noticed /u/cscareerflairbot has joined the mod list. This bot was created by /u/CriticDanger and assigns user flair (semi)automatically based on the rules outlined above.\n\n**If you have already posted in this thread:** you are all set. You don't need to do anything else. You've been flaired (or will shortly be flaired) by the bot!\n\n**If you want colored user flair and don't have it already**: check that you meet the requirements outlined above (you can check your comment karma using [this website](http://reddit.dataoverload.de/karmastats/)). If you do, post a *top-level comment* in this thread and you will be flaired by the bot.\n\n**If you feel that you've graduated to a new color of flair**: post a *new* top-level comment in this thread. You will be flaired by the bot.\n\n**If you've updated your flair text and need your colored flair back**: post a *new* top-level comment in this thread.

I was excited to learn that I was accepted to a top-notch and selective coding bootcamp and I really want to attend but i'm nervous about my career opportunities after i graduate and being trapped in debt. I currently hold no degree besides a HS Diploma and i'm only 20. However, I have been coding since I was very young and have 2 years of real world experience building sites for clients from scratch (Setting up DBs, Servers, Building CMS, and front-end development,.etc). Also, I have built some basic ML apps in Python. I live in NYC so I know the market is competitive but I also know there's a growing demand for programmers. So, what are my odds of being hired w/o a degree and just experience for my age?",

I'm beginning to search for jobs but need help answering these questions because my situation just isn't like your average college student. I'll do my best to be brief but also not omit anything important to note.\n \nIn brief, I'm 32, married, and have 3 kids. My wife works a crap ton, 80hrs/week but from home mostly, and doesn't make much. Summer internships are a commitment that requires too many family sacrifices for a temp position to be worth it (no vacation, loss of food stamp benefits, tax complications, house would become wreck, etc.). Almost every summer for 6 years now I have taken up personal projects teaching myself new technologies and feel right at home programming in several different languages. In truth, comparing myself to your average student in my program, it is safe to say I'm pretty advanced (at the risk of sounding show-offish). Last summer I did take a job as an undergraduate research assistant, which counted more as a scholarship distributed over time so it didn't cause income drama. Over a year I developed virtual reality rehabilitation games and some cool image recognition software for PhD and and master student research projects. Some of these were a team thing, others were solo.\n\nAdditionally, I've had a number of other jobs in my work history. Mostly customer service, but I did work as an audio engineer for 2 1/2 years before I set off for a career change.\n\nTL;DR I'm married and have 3 kids. I've been programming for over 6 years now, and held a number of jobs, just none of them \"in industry,\" and haven't had an internship during my time at school.\n\nI will also note that I have a decent GPA of 3.87.

Tech isn't their main focus, but it's enough that they have a whole section of their policies dedicated to it.\n\nPart of their policies is that as a developer, I am not allowed to work in any other paid development roles. That's fine, I understand that.\n\nHowever, going off of that, I am not allowed to release any of my personal projects without prior approval from the company. This approval is ridiculously complex, involving talking to heads of the company as well as signing documents saying that the company will own my projects. Even after all of that, I am not allowed to sell the projects under any circumstances.\n\nI feel so deflated. I want to create software in my free time, but there's no way I want to pour months of my spare time into a project only for it to get owned by my job, and then I wouldn't even be able to sell it if I wanted to.\n\nOf course, the easy solution is \"do it anyways, they won't find out\". And that's what I planned to do. Until somebody in my department just got fired for a similar situation. I value my paycheck way too much to risk being in that position. Plus the company is massive to the point that I'd greatly fear legal repercussions for violating this stuff.\n\nOf course, the other solution is to quit, but I've seen many posts in here talking about the same clause existing through many tech companies.

            "selftext": "Hello! So I'm in my second semester at community college and currently majoring in Networking. As part of my degree requirements, I've started taking Programming Fundamentals (specifically Java). Last four weeks, we played around in Alice 2.4 learning about Object-Oriented Programming and getting our toes wet. This week we've started using Greenfoot which goes a bit more in-depth. \n\nMy issue is this: Networking bores me to tears. I thought IT was what I wanted to do but now I'm second guessing myself. I love PCs, I love building them, tinkering with em, etc but I can't seem to transfer any of that passion beyond my cat5 cable, to my router or beyond. In class, I'm bored, uninterested and struggling to keep up with the rest of class.\n\nSo back to Programming Fundamentals. I love it. I understand it 100% better than any of my Networking classes , not only that but I enjoy doing it. I've even started looking into Code Academy and other online resources for more Java coursework. I can't wait for us to move past Greenfoot and into the real thing. \n\nBut then on the other hand: I have a close friend who dropped out in the middle of summer classes for an IT Support Desk job making $26/h ($52,000 a year). He has little-to-no IT experience and got the job, partly thanks to his cousin who works there. They've both tried persuading me to apply and join them. Both seem very happy there. \n\nSo.. some basic questions- \n\n1. Can I get by with just an Associates Degree or do I absolutely need a Bachelor's in CS? \n\n2. Does anyone know what the job market is like for Java programmers in the Midwest (specifically the Kansas City area)? ie; super competitive? Easy-ish to find work? So-so?\n\n3. How is the starting pay? Is it comparable or better than 50k a year? e* Or can any one give me some common names of entry level positions for Java so I can look them up? :D\n\n4. Outside of school work and a CS degree, what are some things I can do to make myself more knowledgeable and marketable for a potential employer?? e* If I do go through Code Academy or some other online resource to learn more, is it worth mentioning on a resume? Should I try making some projects on the side? Will an employer even care about any pet/hobby projects I have outside of work?\n\nThank you for reading :D\n\ne* added some stuffs",

At the same time this was going on, our company was acquired by a much larger one. This new company has a much larger support and IS infrastructure and it is beginning to look like they are wanting to migrate from their ITSM software to the one I administer. Being that I am the only one in either company with any experience with this software I would be the one responsible to roll this out to the rest of the company.

I need to decide whether I am going to stick with it or risk losing this opportunity to push myself into another department.\n\nI'm afraid SalesForce might be boring and Ill end up doing it for some years only to realize I'ts not for me when it's too late. I just abandoned a barchelors degree I got in an entirely different field to get into tech as I was sure the field didnt interest me any more. So thats 4 years down the pipe. \n\nOriginally I wanted to go into Java, Android or Penetration Testing as they somewhat creative and widely applicable, leaving the choice of projects I work at and future specialisation up to me (at least to some extent). However they company needed people in SalesForce so they assigned me there. I really want to devote myself to something I'm actually interested in. I know it sounds like a cliche, my apologies for that, but I'm serious, so whatever.\n\nIm new to tech so its hard to decide and thats why I ask this. I dont have the actual Dev experience to make an educated judgement.\n\n1. How much of a chance of pivoting will I have later? Is the experience I might gain from SalesForce worth anything in other tech departments, or is it something so specific and 'technologically-weak' , that if I decide it isn't for me in 2 years I'll be fucked?\n\n2. Is working in SalesForce as boring and monotonous as I Imagine? \n",

Loved school, hate life.. Super depressed that I ended up working at a glorified call center being yelled at by outbound sales reps and solutions architects, I loathe everyday coming into my cold lonely office. Next week I am planning on quitting because I just can't take this much unnecessary stress anymore, I don't agree with this business's ethics or approach to reselling other companies software/hardware it's disgusting... I will be taking courses, going to the gym, and meet ups everyday until I find a new job that I can tolerate.\n\nCoop was the worst in school I got a service desk position at a bank replacing keyboards for stock traders, this was disguised as a QA for stock software role. That was a horrible 4 months and I wish I quit then too but I stuck it out and was happy to go back to school. My second coop was at a software shop as a full stack dev, where I individually created a CRUD web application (with C#/. Net, HTML/CSS, bootstrap, jquery, and etc.) for a North American outlet store this processed inventory orders using WCF transactions. The day I completed the project and handed it to my manager was the day they fired me 2 months into my 4 months coop, I never felt soooo horrible in my life for being taken advantage of like that and then told that I was the worst developer they've ever hired... \n\nSo I graduated school next semester and got a reference at this company from a friend. The day I got hired was the day he got fired and I knew it was a red flag but I accepted anyways out of desperation for money. I get paid fairly well better than about 85% of my peer group. I don't know what to do and that's why I am taking this time to gain some perspective and be free of this stress, my drinking and smoking has increased exponentially since I started and so I need a break from it all.. Depression is just weighing me down and I need to focus on being positive again. \n\nI don't feel like I belong or many ppl belong in this industry, but I love programming and I probably just have imposter syndrome or something. \n\nAny suggestions or advice or anyone relate to my experience? \n\nSidenote: applied for university and was rejected :( gonna reapply with mature status though.",

The reason was that they don't pay more than that for newly recruited people and that I'm just out of school. I explained to him that I finished my technique 4 years ago and have been working since then and that I'm just out of my bachelor, I don't qualify as a junior. His answer was that they were all very impressed of my work and that if I keep up the good work, they'll reward me.  \n* My team lead left the company, after working here for 2 years, because of lack of advancement and low Salary. He then contacted me to join the company that he joined. One the juniors left my team and other senior is also leaving the company, I'll be the \"senior\" here after working for barely 8 months.  \n* After talking to my co-workers, I understand that the maximum salary here is around 75K-80K.  \n* Many benefits, but no RRSP match.  \n\t\nOffer:\n\n* I got approached by another company which is at the top of their domain too. They offered me 80K (I will negotiate for 85K), with all the same benefits and an RRSP match.\n* They are more demanding but there's a lot more to be learned.\n* Mostly creating new feature or new projects with some maintenance.\n* Bigger bonuses.\n\t\nQuestion:\n\n* Would you get the extra 20% in pay + RRSP match for more work and learning or would you stay at your current company with less pay and no way of advancement?",

I forgot). After that, you must do interviews despite gaining years of work experience.\n\nAt Google, after doing an internship, your team had 3-12 months to evaluate your skills.

Is there anything else you would like to know?\n2. Can you take me through a typical day in this job?\n3. What are the biggest challenges you and your team are currently facing? (When the interviewer is answering this question if you can give specific suggestions as to how you would deal with these challenges, or how you have overcome similar challenges in the past, you are likely to stand out from other applicants)\n4. What are the main challenges a new hire would face in this role? \n5. Tell me about your top performers: What is it that sets them apart from the rest? (If you listen carefully this is an opportunity for you to demonstrate your own skills and abilities in these areas. For example: If the interviewers favorite employees are proactive and constantly innovating, you can talk about those qualities in yourself \u2013 if they haven\u2019t already been mentioned in the interview).\n6. How would you describe your ideal candidate? (Same as above)\n7. What advice would you give me if I was successful in this role?\n8. What would be the first things you would do in the role if you were me?\n9. How will you know if your new hire is successful in this role six months from now?\n10. What do you like the most about working in this organisation? (This gives the employer a chance to sell the organisation to you which is what you want)\n11. Do you think I\u2019d be a good fit in your team? Do you have any concerns about me as a candidate? (This question is important because it allows you to kill any potential monsters whilst they\u2019re still small and to remove any and all doubt from the interviewers mind) \n12. Can you take me for a quick tour of the office? (I love this question because it gives you a chance to see the office and potentially your new workmates as they are in reality. It also puts the interviewer on the back foot and it destroys the facade when you walk through the office and see people on Facebook etc.)\nIf you would like to know more: http://lifelessons.co/personal-development/interview-mistakes-to-avoid/",

Was a totally awesome experience, got to work in a service oriented architecture. Really great code quality. Learned a ton of stuff. \n\nI left earlier this year to travel for a bit while I was still young and move back to where I grew up. Ended up going around the world for a few months, totally awesome time. \n\nAnyways when I came back, I accepted a job with a company that while not unicorn status has pretty healthy funding. Everyone at the company is pretty smart, but they have a large monolithic application that was built when they were still in start up mode that they're not really moving away from. Lots of long functions and middle wear jammed into a web application. Functions are pretty tightly coupled and there doesn\u2019t really seem to be much long term thought put into the code base. When I interviewed I was under the impression I would be working with a new technology that I haven\u2019t quite gotten to use as much as I would believe. Additionally it was supposed to be a full stack role, which I was interested in since I mostly made web services before. I don\u2019t think any of this was malicious, just business priorities have changed since then.\n\nAnd the nature of the tasks seems to focus on just jamming more code into the middle wear of the web application, instead of doing any sort of meaningful system design.  In short it just feels like I\u2019m a code monkey now instead of doing serious software engineering like I was at my last job.   I do like the job besides that, I like my coworkers much more than at my first job, and I like my boss. \n\nNot only that I\u2019m pretty confident I could drive much more value for the company if I was able to start breaking out pieces of the monolithic application into a more testable service oriented structure. Anyways the real question I\u2019m wondering is if there is a way I can diplomatically bring this up to my boss? I\u2019m pretty dissatisfied with the work I\u2019m doing now, but I\u2019m afraid they would just be like \u2018tough shit this is what we need done\u2019, which I understand from a business perspective. The main thing I\u2019m worried about really is my skills regressing.\n\nTLDR; Left totally dope job where I learned to move home, have new job where I like the coworkers, frustrated with tasks and code quality, how do I bring this up without seeming like a whiny baby/arrogant know it all early career dev?",

I have some work experience in *backend* web development. I like it, but wouldn't necessarily say it's something I like *a lot*. I also play around with a variety of technologies in my spare time, but I'm having a hard time focusing on something in particular.\n\n\nI *really* enjoy the JavaScript side of *frontend* web - the frameworks, the tooling, the open source scene, etc. However: I don't mind HTML, but I definitely find it very annoying to work with CSS. I know it's fundamental for the kind of job, but I *really* don't find it enjoyable to, say, convert a sketch design into a web page (I do like to add functionality to it, though). Other than \"JavaScript engineering\" positions, I understand that the typical *frontend* role demands a lot of both HTML and CSS, and that turns me off a bit, to be honest.\n\n\nI also have very minimal experience with iOS development, but I like it quite a bit. However, it does seem like a much more closed ecosystem (than, say, web), and I'm scared that by following the iOS path I'll be constraining my skillset early on (*i.e.* Swift/Obj-C don't have much utility outside of the specific iOS/OSX ecosystem).\n\n\nWhat do you think would be the best step for me?\n\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n\n*P.S.: I know there are more career paths other than web/mobile, but as for now these are the fields that pump me up more.* ",

They have a great location, and a really robust benefits package.\n\nWhen I was at the interview, they asked me if I was OK with working overtime, as they often stay late, or sometimes come in on the weekends. This set off some red-flags, as I was under the impression it was a salaried position, but I'm not opposed to working overtime.\n\nWhen they contacted me to make the offer, they said it would only pay 22 dollars an hour (~45k a year) which is fairly low for an expensive city.\n\nThat said, I did some math. If I worked on average 50 hours a week (with time and a half overtime) it bumps it up to 62k a year. I'm pretty OK with that, especially considering they have good benefits.\n\nI hear all the stories about how there is a flood of new graduates coming out every year, and that its hard to get your foot in the door (especially when I have no software development experience), and I really like everything (except salary) so its pretty hard to think I would turn it down when I have nothing else lined up. What do you guys think?\n\nI'm also curious about how taking a QA engineer position would effect future job searches. I'm certainly not opposed to QA, I think its an important part of the development process. But if I, in the future, would be interesting in pursuing a software engineering position, how much would having a QA engineering role on my resume help?\n\nSorry about the wall of text, and thanks for any advice you can give me.",

I want to ask some question related to computer science studies and universities in the UK.\n\n\n1. Which university in the UK would you recommend for computer science studies. I'm doing quite well at school (not as good as to get into Cambridge or Oxford) and I think that I should have a chance to get into universities like Warwick, Manchester... So which university in the UK woudl be the best for computer science studies right now?\n\n2. I also want to ask which degree would be the best to choose? Should I focus and choose software engineering, artifficial intelligence, mathematics. Which one is the best? (Maybe someone with some experience could tell how much of a diferrence there is between these courses and what is it like to study each one of them)\n\n3. Finally I want to ask what does the typical day of a computer science student look like? What do you do during classes? How much free time do you have? Is it very hard and tiring? Etc.\n\nThank you!",

I have been asked to head a project where we will be developing a platform to replace what we're using, which right now is a bit of a disaster. My responsibilities will not to be to do the coding, but to manage the project from the \"customer\" side. I have no real CS experience other than reverse engineering code other people have written. Right now I manage a national retail/big box service/maintenance account and we are using Service Max as our FSM. \n\nOur company's bread and butter is TS contracting stuff, and as a result we do have a proprietary FSM platform in place that is closely integrated with our financials, payroll, reporting, dispatch, you name it. As of now, we're not 100% on the direction we will be going with the project, but some ideas being thrown around are building new modules for our existing FSM platform to fit our the divisions business model, sticking with ServiceMax and developing that full-time (now owned by GE, so who knows where that is headed,) and even an out-of-the-box solution (which I've no idea where to begin.) Right now, I do help our devs with our ServiceMax platform in my \"spare\" time, but this would be a full time position. We will likely transfer this dev our division so we have him full-time through the project and to support it afterwards. Integration between our customers systems, ServiceMax --> and our proprietary systems has been the strategy so far but the limitations are very clear and we have been given approval to move forward with something more substantial and comprehensive.\n\nI'm inclined to lean towards developing what we have (which is actually pretty powerful from what I can tell.) \nQuestions that immediately come to me are:\nGiven that I only have a \"hobbyist\" grasp of software development, would any certs, courses, etc, help me get better results out of this project? \nIf we go for an out-of-the-box solution, are any worth it? Recommendations?\nI am not much of a micro manager, and I fully intend on letting our devs do what they do, but I will need gain a deeper understanding and probably begin learning to do the thing myself, on some level. Is this foolish? I have a bit of python/java knowledge and some networking know-how but other than that I'll be a useless meatbag. \n\nJust wanted to get this out there in case anyone had any advice or homework recommendations before this kicks off before the end of the year.

After my contract not being renewed back in February I've had a lot of interviews but still, rejection after rejection. This has left me pretty damn discouraged, and I'm looking at potentially making a change to web development.\n\nI'm very strong with the \"infrastructure\" side of things and have a decent background in system analysis/design (my capstone project for my bachelors was lauded and we almost went into business with it). I had a software development internship back in 2014 that I left to go into I.T. for, largely because I felt useless and the tech was ollllllld (VB6).\n\nMy question is, is this a realistic goal? Is my background potentially a positive, or is it almost universally seen as a negative for potential webdev managers/owners? I'm thinking of starting out learning JavaScript and Python (am already pretty familiar with them, did my share of scripting in the past). Is the pay comparable or better than in I.T.? Job outlook better? I get the sense that I would have access to more interesting and diverse work than I would have setting up vmware or router configs, but I want to be sure. And the potential for meaningful side work is exciting.\n\nIn my city there is a program called launchcode that will pair you with an established company after you pass a certain baseline of coding aptitude. I intend to go for that to cover my lack of experience since my internship.\n\nAnyway, I'm still pretty early in my search into this, but it seems exciting in its possibilities.

(30/100)\n\nMind you I have been promoted to lead developer at my current position (the work not the pay) so I'm not completely dumb but I feel like it after finishing that test.\n\nAnyways how did you guys prep for the technical parts of the interview process? My goal is to switch jobs in March so I have plenty of time but it also appears that I need plenty of preparation. ",

My company went through an acquisition at the beginning of this year and ever since then it's been chaos. So the chaos and on top of that none of us are paid well, both those things have made me finally start interviewing. \n\nNow, I've received an offer from a well known bootcamp in my area to be a teacher's aide for their online course. They said there's plenty of opportunities to move up in the company and I can work remote whenever I want. They're offering me $57k and a nice benefit package which would put me above the average for my market. \n\nI have an interview for a .NET development position at a company who does millions in revenue every year this Friday. I'm very interested in them after they described their culture and how a typical workday goes. \n\nI'm concerned though.

Throughout my college career, I've often taken the leader role when it came to group projects and have really enjoyed the roles, despite the frustrations you get with people not pulling their weight.\n\nMy question is whether I should work as a developer for a few years before considering a project management position, or should I actually try to apply for project management positions now. As I search for positions in my area, as well as others I would be willing to relocate to, a lot of them require at least a few years of experience. As a student, I obviously don't have professional experience. I have revised my resume to fit more of the skillset of a project manager, but I fear that's not enough. So what do I do?

For some background, I went back to uni in 2015 (I'm 34) and did an MSc conversion course in software development which I finished this April. I handed in my dissertation on a Thursday and started my current job the following Monday. I work as a QA in a large multinational company.\n\nBasically I'm really unhappy here for lots of different reasons, but I know realistically it would be pretty bad for me to quit now and mess up my CV etc. I want to be a developer, and although I passed the MSc and got pretty good marks in most of my modules, it was so intense that I found myself having to memorise a lot of stuff to pass exams etc rather than taking the time to understand things, and there are still really, really basic OOP concepts that I'm very rusty on. I've been to a few dev interviews and completely bombed on the technical stuff, and I'm running out of leave to take for them anyway. \n\nWhat I had in mind as a get-out was to get a part time office job and study in my free time, first going over all my programming module materials and getting confident with OOP, then, or maybe in parallel, learning another language and/or getting a few side projects up and running. I just found out yesterday that I got accepted for a sweet part time office job that would give me a full week off every third week.\n\nWhat I want to know is has anyone been in a similar situation and taken the same route? How did it work out? Does anyone have any other advice for me? Thank you in advance!",

I recently found out how software development managers make and one of the most in demand, and so I want to study it. Also, one of the reasons that I'm considering changing my status to student is because I probably would get more chances of getting better money making opportunities after studies, and be able to make money while studying.\n\nHaving said that, could you guys suggest institutions that might be of interest to me? Not looking for an expensive one. What do you think of Cerritos College? Doesn't have to be a conventional school. At least an institution so that I can be on student visa. Of course, a very good institution to be a student of but at a very reasonable price. I'm not looking at an undegra course, pretty sure can't afford it. Probably associates.\n\nI love my GoPro. And it's what inspires me the most to get into software dev. How could I better make my camera through software? What else can I do with it? Those sorts of things. Right now, I'm playing around with a hack that's potentially a replacement for the GoPro app. It's works from desktop/laptop (only works in Linux at the moment). I've been looking for something like this since I got my GoPro, so I can see what my GoPro sees on a larger screen so I see a lot more details. Oh, and this is wireless by the way, connects via wifi \ud83d\ude0d. And so, that's what I've been busy with. The hack is by KonradIT on Github. Huge props to him!\n\n",

We have a lot of members from each group, although surprisingly freshman are probably the most well represented.\n\n\nI'm pretty surprised at the number of freshman with programming experience.  I don't mean Java \"Hello World!\" experience, I mean machine learning in python or designed a mobile app in high school experience.  Maybe it's because I attend a top CS school, or maybe things have gotten really competitive lately.\n\n\n\nLately, I was helping a random student on campus prepare for internship interviews.  The student was stressing they could not answer Leetcode medium or hard questions.  The student was then going on about how they know BFS vs. DFS, dynamic programming, etc and should be able to solve this problem.  \n\n\nI was shocked when I asked the student for his year in school and he mentioned freshman.

I want to incorporate projects that will make us Community College students more marketable when we apply to internships. Because we are competing against University level students that are about to graduate. Projects that would check off the buzzwords like AWS, Docker, Server (MySQL), scripting language (python from Rpi projets), maybe some front end web development.\n**4** Useful skills like learning git/github, proper workflows for github. Learning or practicing on how to tackle programming problems differently. \n\n\n\nThis is my first time being an officer for a club. And to be honest I don't know if I am taking a step in the right direction.\nMy main goal this semester is to work on technical and marketable projects, resume/interview workshops, learning industry techniques (proper version control implementation), tutoring for cs club members, have developers come and tell us about the industry and what THEY would want in an applicant, and to build a club that could be known throughout the community for doing extra-ordinary wok. \n Are there any suggestions from former club officers who ran their club efficiently, whether it is the ideas I came up with for the fall semester, or project ideas, or any developers that would be willing to come give talks (coffee and treats will be provided).

I'm not sure whether I should get a degree which would take 2.5 years starting this January or just get skills myself. I\u2019m 24 and I already have a dinky psychology degree in Toronto, Canada. I\u2019m not sure if I should go back to school or just learn the skills by myself or go to a boot camp. I plan on working in the states which probably would require a CS degree for the TN visa but I\u2019m not sure if it would be possible for me to work there with a TN Visa without a CS degree. I just feel kind of dumb that my main reason for going back to school (as opposed to just going to a boot camp or self-learning) is simply because of the TN visa. I'm hoping the degree might be useful if it comes to negotiating better salaries.\n\nTuition is going to cost me roughly $16K whereas boot camp cost 9K I think. My main reason for living in the states would be the better pay, along with some other things like the weather and cities. \n\nOn top of this dilemma, I still don\u2019t know if this profession is right for me. I'm worried about how it seems far less social than other professions. I also have little clue what a day in the life of a programmer/developer is like. This is why I\u2019m reluctant  to go to school because I would be wasting tons of money/time for something I might possibly dislike. How can I get a tangible experience of what is like to be a programmer so I can have more certainty?\n\nThe main things I want to know are\n\n\n*-Will a degree land me a better paying job/more opportunities in the long run as opposed to just going in to an entry position from bootcamp?\n\n*-Should I go back to school for 2.5 years?\n\n*-Why is programming/CS a good career decision? It\u2019s ranked highly when it comes to job satisfaction, why do you think this is?\n\n*-How can I get a taste for this profession?\n",

I'll cover more in the next videos. \n\nI'm very glad that this will be of value to you. I plan to go into more data structures and algorithms in the next videos, but I also want your feedback. \nSo please comment on the video about:\n- What you liked about the video\n- What you learned or found interesting\n- What other problems you'd like to see\n\nAlso feel free to criticize, that's how we learn :)\n\nI have put in a good amount of effort to make it high quality. So I would love to see it benefit a lot more people. So **here is my request to you:**\nPlease share this video right now with at least one person that you think would benefit.

I applied to a research institute for a Web developer position, and as far as I know it only requires a bachelor's degree and three years experience in industry even though it's faculty position. I had about a 30 minute phone interview and was later invited to interview. There was one glassdoor interview review for a similar position and they rated the interview as easy. When someone contacted me about the onsite interview, I asked about the process and was told that I needed to have a 20 minute presentation for a non-technical audience. Okay, I can't really present my work because of confidentiality agreements, but I thought I had a handle on what I could present. No problems, plus I had some time to put some stuff together. Later, a follow up email that briefly explained what was expected, I needed to have an overview of my technical background and to either have a high level walk through of one of my projects or a training session on how to use a feature. I thought maybe I could use one of my projects from school since what I currently work on has less to do with web development (they know this). My interview is in two days and I was just sent the schedule. It consists of a search committee interview, four individual interviews with some pretty high up people, and a presentation. At this point, I started to become suspicious and phoned them to clarify. The interview is a full on FACULTY style interview. The presentation is open to the entire DAMN department, most likely with a poster advertisment pasted around the building announcing the presentation. Every time I asked about the interview process no one bothered to mention anything of the sort, in fact, they were very nonchalant about it. I have less than two days, plus I have my real job to go to. Do I say I'm not coming? What would I even present at this point? I've been to similar open interviews and it's no fucking joke. PhDs prepare their entire careers for these types of interviews. I am so anxious, I am shaking. \n\nUPDATE:  I was able rebound and refocus my presentation to a larger audience. It was definitely the hardest interview I've had, but I left feeling pretty good about it. Got an offer two days later.",

            "selftext": "**Warning lengthly post\n\nI have been lurking on this subreddit for some time now and lately i\u2019ve been on the fence about quitting my job at a well known company. I\u2019ve been here for a little more than 1.5 years as a Software QA Engineer. When I first signed on, I always wanted to be a dev but they enticed me by saying I would be doing automation and coding so I took the job. Also, I couldn\u2019t say no to the offer and prestige of a such a well known place. However, shortly after joining they moved me to a project where I quickly became the lead QA of a very big product. For awhile, things were good as I was learning tons from such a big project. The product itself has many different components and I worked directly with dev to test which in turn helped me learn a lot. Also, I had to start managing an offshore team with calls during the night and I started signing off on releases. \n\nAfter quite some time on this project, I started missing coding which I had informed my boss. Luckily, he moved me to other projects needing automation. Sometimes, I would have to work insane hours automating and certifying releases but I was happy because I got to code. \n\nRecently, the other project had some difficulties in which I had to return. As I came back, its in a terrible shape. There were some production issues that has caused huge damage to the project. There has been talk of firing and, even though I wasn\u2019t on the team at the time, my job is on the line. Any mistake going forward will result in heads rolling. Coming back to this project, I am in a high stress situation and its cutting into my personal life. I feel anxious all the time and its hard for me to sleep and eat these days. After getting yelled at midnight by my boss the other day, I finally broke down and cried.\n\nI had a 1:1 with my manager and told him about how crazy things have been lately. All he really said was hold on itll get better. I dread going to work each day now as I feel like I don\u2019t have a grasp on this project anymore. Next time I have to certify dev\u2019s changes, my name will be on the email and if there is another mistake its my name that will go down. I have told him how I was the most happy here when I was coding and asked if I could move to dev but I was shot down. Essentially he responded with this is the best place to be to learn and I am in a place of great exposure especially in QA. He mentioned how I wouldn\u2019t grow in a dev role but going down the QA path there are so many doors open. I\u2019m really conflicted now as I feel he has lured me back into a soul crushing job. \n\nSince this is my first job out of college, I am worried if I quit I\u2019ll have a bad reputation on my record. I am also worried now that I have pigeonholed myself into a QA position. I\u2019ve already started job hunting for SWE roles but I don\u2019t hear back from anyone. The instant I apply for any QA roles, I hear back from so many different companies.\n\nI mainly wanted to rant but also ask for advice in this situation. I feel these days I work too much to even start prepping for interviews let alone schedule them. I\u2019m working weekends day and night and I was so prepared to submit my two weeks until my 1:1 with my manager. I currently don\u2019t have any lined up right now so quitting I would have to live on my savings for awhile while job hunting. \n\nThank you for reading. Sorry for such a long and lengthy post. I know I am just a random internet stranger but any advice or insight right now would mean so much for me. \n",

I fear continuing to work there is actively harming my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 as much of the work is menial: business analyst tasks, manual QA testing, and occasional scripting and simple programming tasks. In short, my skills and experience are definitely being underutilized.\n\nI've been applying for other remote jobs without much success. Previously, finding a local job had been easy, but taking another local job right now is incompatible with other life goals. The remote positions are a little different from my previous experience (mostly corporate internal development) but sound far more interesting, but part of the challenge seems to be (1) the whiteboarding interviews (I studied this stuff over ten years ago in college) and (2) persuading these startups to not just toss out my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 because it looks too enterprisey.\n\nThe idea of grinding LeetCode/CTCI for weeks just to get a new job sounds beyond terrible, especially given how much grinding the present job has already sapped my energy and motivation.\n\nAny advice? Financially, quitting the present job to give myself a few weeks to recuperate isn't a great option.",

I stopped going for like a year now and really want to finish my degree. The main reason I stopped is because I started working some time ago and it's just really difficult to go to school (on-site classes only) and work at same time, especially when (almost) all the classes are during the day and some classes required to graduate is not offered at night. It's been a constant dilemma for me on what to do. I have been thinking of ways to finish it and I think one possibility is transferring to another school with online classes. Does anyone know of schools that allow transferring units from another university and offer online classes? This is for a CS graduate degree, however, I wouldn't mind looking into it if you know that the school offers online classes for a CS bachelor degree. Thank you!",

I am lucky enough and grateful to be living off the graces of my parents for the time being, so I have food and a roof and a bed. What would you do with this time to improve your situation?\n\nWhat can I do to make some money/improve my skills in the meantime? Are there such thing as temp SWE/IT jobs? I don't want to interview for a career job knowing I might have to turn it down. Yet then again, should I be looking for something better than what I was promised, and then turn down job #1 after saying yes? (I know some of you may call this unethical and other names, but considering they made me wait 1.5 years before my start date, I think they wouldn't be surprised if I did)\n\nShould I do a coding camp? I feel rusty in my skills and if I can finish a coding camp and land an offer at Big4...\n\nI've been reading a lot about starting your own company(!!)/youtubechannel/vlogging/dropshipping/online retail and make a million bucks. This is dangerous.\n\nBackground, I am a MechE major, almost finished with MechE/CS but decided to graduate earlier instead, while having CS skills from my past internships.\n\nO' wise sages of the internet, what would you do in my situation?",

On the other hand, I was also admitted to a lower tier state school in Arizona where I would have the option to pursue a B.S. degree in computer science. \n\nIf you were to be an employer looking at these two candidates, what would be your opinion on these two candidates and which would you most likely lean towards given every other aspect is identical for both. I'm asking this question because obviously, regardless of which school I choose to attend, I would continue to work on the same projects, practice interviews etc. \n\nAdditionally, I am planning on going to graduate school to study statistics meaning that my undergraduate degree would not be the only degree I base my career on.\n\nThanks in advance!",

But most of these jobs are local and are for huge corporations or vague \"solutions companies\", not necessarily opportunities I am eager about.\n\nI was wondering if there was some method of networking over the internet that people take advantage of in a situation like this, such as finding people on LinkedIn and asking for informational interviews, or whatever it is. Or is simply sending resumes out and praying to fate my only option?\n\nOh and for what it's worth, I am probably a pretty average candidate for a CS major - I have a solid set of portfolio projects, an internship under my belt (doing React.Js), and go to a highly respected school but I am not necessarily a person who lives and breathes code and knows a computer inside and out, nor do I have an extensive GitHub contribution history. \n",

            "selftext": "**Some background :**\n\nI graduated college here in Canada with an Advanced Diploma (3 year program) in Computer Programming. (Comparing my program to the USA I would say it is a little like or above an associates degree, not a bachelors.)  \n\nI have 2 years experience as a Software Developer, been at my current job for ~ 6 months, worked at a different company for ~1.5 years before leaving (as a dev as well). I do the whole github, conferences, portfolio or personal apps/side projects thing in my spare time to stay current.\n\nBoth times that I was looking for a job, I did not have a rough time. I get LinkedIn recruiters every couple weeks or so. \n\nI would say that I do have impostor syndrome because of my lack of a bachelors and because of this, I recently started taking courses online to get a bachelors (Athabasca University - fully accredited, public owned, decent reputation in Canada/US). My university is very flexible when it comes to classes. You can complete at own pace, take as many or as few classes as you want. As someone who wants to get a degree and keep working, making the choice to go to this university was a no-brainer. \n\nI am 24, do not want to spend any more time in a classroom, looking to buy a house, have grown man bills. Online University is my only option right now. After doing my research, it seems that Athabasca University is the best option to get an accredited degree in Canada right now.\n\nI am only taking the program to make myself more hireable. I feel that during my job search, even though it was short both times, there was a lot of jobs that I missed out on because of my lack of a bachelors. I am taking this degree to change this for next time in the future. Simply to click that checkbox asking about a bachelors degree.\n\nMy dilemma is that, the university I am going to does not have a 'pure' Computer Science program. The program is a Bsc in Computing and Information Systems. \n\nSo far the courses that I am taking are all CS type courses. Not as much math as a regular CS program but learning data structures, Java & C++. Looking at the course selection available, it seems I can pretty much carry on this route of taking programming type classes. The only problem I have is that once I graduate, my degree will say \"Bachelor of Science Major in Computing and Information Systems BSc CIS\". \n\nFrom the research that I have been doing lately online into this, it seems that most CIS degrees are geared to more IT/ DevOp / Business Analyst positions (**It this true?**). I couldn't see myself doing any of those as I am passionate about programming. \n\n**Will having a CIS degree (and not CS) potentially stand in my way in the future as a developer?** Is an Advanced Diploma + CIS degree + experience as a Software Developer going to be enough to keep me hireable?. \n\n**Could the CIS degree somehow pigeon hole me into a different non developer/engineer path even though I would have 4+ years of dev experience by the time I am done?**\n\n\n\n\n**TLDR:**\n\n**Any devs out there with a CIS degree? Has it stood in your way at any point?**\n\nThanks guys. \n\n",

However, the job prospects in this area are scarce, especially for our fields (IT for me, graphic design for her).\n\nWe were thinking about a way to convince our companies to let us work remotely, and perhaps come into the office one day a week if necessary (it'll be a 2 hour drive one way).\n\nSome background on me. I'm a software engineer for one of the big auto companies. I've been with this company for a bit over 2 years, but I've been in my current position for about 4 months. My company allows folks to work from home on the regular, and there looks to be HR policy around working remotely full time (basically a manager/employee agreement).\n\nNow, how can I start the negotiation process with my manager? Should I apply for a remote position with another company and approach him when I get an offer? Or should I talk to him about a transition process to ease into working remotely?\n\nI have experience working from home on the regular with this company, 1 day a week with my old supervisors, but none with this new one.\n\nAny help would be appreciated!

(Only Automation engineering in the past 2 really, which is still coding fortunately). I do pretty well in my field but have been pining for something more.\n\nI've always loved Hardware and embedded and have messed around with Arduino's for a while. I decided to get really serious in wanting a career change in the past 6 months and have been doing the UT Austin edX Embedded Courses online. They use the ARM Cortex M4 architecture and im using the TI TIVA board to do development. \n\nIm loving it so far and it's super interesting. Im learning a lot and can finally understand datasheets and such. My electronics knowledge is ok, not amazing or anything. My I understand the basics. I can solder pretty decent and know how to use a logic analyzer/multimeter.\n\nThing is...everything i've read seems to say (especially on the Electronics stack exchange) is that C.S. is just not a good major for embedded development.\n\nAlso im a bit unsure of how \"Low\" level I should be learning. I originally started with the nand2tetris course(http://nand2tetris.org/course.php), which while interesting...didn't really get into actually programming on a device. But was more about creating a language from gates/transistors. And while interesting (and pretty confusing) it seemed maybe out of scope?\n\nOr is that something I should know? I feel like actually working with the Chips would be more what a CE (Computer Engineer) might do in college, but Im not sure. Our college didn't even offer CE until AFTER i graduated.\n\nAm I doing the right thing? Would you hire someone that did some coding as a QA but has spent time on learning a Chip Architecture like ARM (I plan on getting some project examples together to show that I know how to interface via UART/LCD Screens/Wireless/etc...)",

            "selftext": "Hey guys. Bit of a long post. Tl;dr at the bottom.\n\nFirst a little bit of backstory. I graduated with a CS degree about 3 months ago. Afterward graduating i applied for alot of jobs. To my surprise i got two offers rather fast. I went with the company that was the best fit for the path i want to take in my career (full stack development). On top of that they also offered some very good working conditions. I could start at the job right away as a junior programmer. Keep in mind, this is my very first job as a programmer.\n\nFast forward two months. I am very happy with the job. I am learning alot of stuff everyday and i get to write code for a living (which is awesome). Most of my coworkers are nice and are always open to ask for help. However, this brings us to the title of this post.\n\nI am really terrified of fucking up. Fucking up as in making huge mistakes which result in slowing down development in the long term. For example, just simple stuff as merging my changes with someone elses, or making database changes. While i do know the stuff i was taught in school, the pressure of not fucking up makes me feel like i have no fucking idea what i'm doing.\n\nOn top of that, i am really insecure about my programming. I am aware that i am not the best programmer in the world and probably won't ever be. But i feel like i am miles behind the rest in terms of coding. Whenever i come up with a solution that works, i keep thinking that it's probably just a sloppy piece of code that will probably break the build somewhere down the line (even after testing). I can only imagine the terror if i would accidently hear a senior dev say \"who the fuck wrote this?\" about my code.\n\nAll in all this causes quite alot of stress for me, which i know is unnecessary. I feel like i'd never be able to finish a huge story or task by myself. If i were to take a big task with the added responsibility, the stress would probably cause me to worry 24/7, even on my off days. I mean it should be acceptable for a junior dev to make mistakes right? I'd love to gain confidence as a programmer, but i have no clue how to. \n\nHas anyone else been in the same place?\n\n\nTL;DR: Just graduated, found a job as a junior dev which i absolutely love. However i am scared of fucking up and am really insecure about my programming. Would love advice and am curious if anyone else has been in the same place.",

The worst case scenario with this is I won't have enough industry related experience to compete with other candidates.\n\nThe other option is to find internships during this period. The perks of this option are that I can gain experience in the industry(maybe even being offered a job!), potential time flexibility around classes, and similar pay to what I'm doing now. The worst case scenario is I could potentially be without a job for stretches of time. This is risky because I have to pay bills and rent while going to school.

            "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm 24 years old and I currently work as a DBA for a large organization. I have been here for a little less than a year now, and before my current position, I worked as a DBA/Hadoop Admin at another company for a little less than 2 years (where I was pretty successful for the time I was there, several raises and a promotion in a short period of time), which was my first job after college.\n\nGenerally, I enjoy a good bit of my duties as a DBA currently (there are slow points, but there are also crazy times, so it evens out) and got a very good raise going to my second job. However, the only reason I even ended up leaving my first job was because the company was going through a period of heavy rumors regarding outsourcing/layoffs for well over a year, and it just became too much to deal with on a daily basis (everyday you'd hear a new rumor that would conflict what you heard the day before, and it really wore me down). These rumors turned out to be true, as basically all of my old coworkers were laid off a few months after I left. \n\nSo, while I felt fortunate to have found a job before the layoffs and for getting a raise while I'm at it, going through that kind of experience that early in my career has definitely left me with a never-ending fear of losing my job (I struggle with anxiety in general, but it's been particularly bad in this area recently)\n\nAt my current position, I work mainly as an Oracle DBA (It's what I started on, but I spent 6-12 months working pretty heavy on SQL Server, and about 6 months as the sole Hadoop Admin at my first job), and again, I don't dislike my job, but I struggle with the fear of layoffs almost everyday. On top of that, news just came out this last week that Oracle is planning to release a \"fully autonomous\" database at OpenWorld in early October, and it really set off my fears again. My current company doesn't use a public cloud (we  have a large private cloud), so I don't think that this new product will directly affect me immediately, but it does have me feel like the writing is on the wall for my job eventually.\n\nOutside of work, my personal life is in a period of change. I am getting married next summer, and my fiance and I just signed a year long lease last month (we'd like to buy a house, but she just got out of school and is working in a job that she doesn't want to do for long enough for me to feel confident in picking a location for a house, if that makes sense). So, the large expense of the wedding, combined with the commitment of a year-long lease, have me thinking of worst case scenarios, where I get laid off soon, have to scramble to find employment to keep up with bills, have to cancel the wedding, etc. It's really driving me nuts, and it's heavily affecting my day-to-day life. I don't even feel like I can enjoy a weekend, but instead am trying to shove as much learning into my head as possible, just in case I need to look for another job.\n\nBasically, I wanted to rant somewhere just to get it off my chest (I'm sure my fiance is just about sick of hearing about it at this point), but I also wanted to ask what people thought are the best next steps in my career path, if I actually decide to leave DBA work behind.\n\nI know a fair bit of Python (I actually love using it, but I'm the only person on my team that knows it, so when I write scripts or programs in it for work, I'm usually asked to rewrite it in bash so my team members can read it), and write my side projects in it mostly. I'm re-learning Java on the side right now, but it's slow going since I have so many things I'm trying to learn at the same time.\n\nMy time as a Hadoop admin could be a point of strength, I suppose, but to be honest, I really didn't like that job, as most of my time was spent sitting in on meetings pretty much all day, and clicking GUI buttons to patch, check the status of services, etc. It wasn't really stuff that used a lot of brain power. I'd enjoy working in the Big Data arena (I have experience with the MongoDB and Cassandra DB platforms, but they haven't been heavily used at my first two jobs).\n\nSo the basic TL;DR:\n\nI'm scared of losing my job to an abnormal degree, and it has me scrambling to learn new areas of tech, so that I can more easily find a new job if it comes to that, but I am looking for opinions on what area(s) would be best to focus on, giving my experience so far in my career.\n\nThanks everyone!",

Basically, if someone else starts the interaction it's fine, or I need to know something etc. but I don't really start them unless I need to, and this is more out of just being asocial than any fear or ineptitude. I do find mandated socializing draining and will tactfully avoid it if I can, but again more out of just my preference of how to spend my time and rapidly rising boredom than \"Oh shit humans, wat do?\" anxieties. I don't really see coworkers as anything beyond just that, unless I happen to click with specific people.

I wanted to get some honest opinions from people in the industry so I can stop feeling crazy.\n\nI was promised by a recruiter that the position would be a traditional hour work week with flexible hours and even 10% time. I found out my first day that none of this was true, which left me starting off my job with a sour taste of feeling deceived, as well as a lonely trek to find lunch myself as nearly nobody in the office saw it fit to speak to me that day. I decided to just suck it up at the time and keep my head high. Later though, I was assigned what is equivalent to data-entry work for 20% of my day and to manage environments through a GUI with infrastructure designed poorly, which results in movement of code regularly taking around an hour, with me needed as a middleman to work with other team members whom at times give me attitude, to fix problems.\n\nOn top of this I found out that the team I was joining does not work on any new features I was told about in the interview. An internal webapp with a production UX so poor I\u2019d be humiliated to show any of my developer friends the tool I\u2019m working on. And a data-entry app written in VB. When I spoke with my manager about my unhappiness with the non-development portion of my role he politely said that because I\u2019m new, I\u2019m going to have to show face and deal with it until the responsibility can be thrown to somebody else and I could focus on development. Which I found to be a fairly toxic course of action for a part of the company\u2019s infrastructure that needed improvement. \n\nThough I\u2019m a new grad, I had already gathered about two years of work experience and came from a previous job in which the culture was very supportive. I learned more than I could have ever imagined I could in the short time I spent there. This new role feels like a massive step backwards and I feel as though I have nothing to learn from this experience. I wanted to know if in my situation I should hop, or suck up the poor culture and stay for the generally accepted year.\n",

He said (paraphrasing), \"If you're so sure your investments are as great as you advertise, certainly you'd have no problem wagering your own money against a dumb strategy like the S&P\". At first, nobody even stepped up to take his offer. Finally someone did, and today he conceded he lost.\n\nI'm reposting this from Hacker News, but it's worth it to take a close look at trading firms this way: they're not doing anything other than making the fund managers rich. There's no \"magic sauce\"/ML/\"low lateny algorithm\" that can consistently make money  in the market, versus just buying a fund that invests in the entire S&P. It's all a waste of time, money, and brain power.\n\nWhat does this mean for you? If you're young and want a job in the big city, and program all the codes for some trading company, whatever. Go for it. Just realize that you're not contributing to anything. At the end of the day, you wrote a bunch of code that does some pseudoscience bullshit on electronic securities. The only people making real money are the fund managers and the owners of these places (and they're not even making money off *anything you even do*, they're just skimming off the top via \"fees\"). You're not even an integral part of the machine, you're just there to go through the motions to make it look like work is being done (at least in some circumstances). If you're ok with that, fine. Just don't lie to yourself and think that what you do matters at all or (most importantly) that your alleged \"success\" is in any way tied to your actual performance. It's just tied to the random winds of the stock market as a whole. It's just gambling.\n\nFintech companies are at least selling functional products, regardless of whether they're used by HFT firms or not. We all need money, and there are legitimate reasons to have publicly traded companies. So certainly not all trading is bad, I just want young people to think twice before they dive into the field working on these \"magical technical high-frequency machines\" that are effectively no better at making money than S&P index funds that have been around for 30+ years.",

There's also been some posts by recruiters on Reddit that a M.S. in C.S. after an unrelated bachelors is an indicator of failure in the job market.\n\nI'm not concerned about opportunity costs to income.

I'll have to pay for it myself, but my original degree is debt free. Does it sound like I have time for local internships each summer and research / programming team during the academic years?\n\nThank you for taking the time to digest my post!

I've been working a little over 3 years and so far in my career I've touched almost every part of the stack in a typical web/mobile application. ML seems like the only black box that I've never worked on and I want to get started on it.\n\nI understand ML on a very high level; what it is and its applications. I've seen people recommend Andrew Ng's ML course on coursera but I really wonder whether that is close to what people do in the industry. I want to start out with a high-level understanding of what it is that people in the industry do, how the work is divided in a typical ML team, how ML is served, things of that nature.\n\nI assume that at a big company there is a person making decisions about what areas/problems to focus on. I'm guessing there is a person deciding which data needs to be gathered/making hypothesis. There must be a person setting up data pipelines and running ETL jobs to feed the data. There must also be a person that creates some input system for supervised learning cases. Finally there must be a person tuning the ML algorithm and testing multiple variations of it to get the right coefficients. But how does this work?\n\nIf I work on the data pipeline side, am I truly working on ML? Or am I just a data engineer.\n\nAnd also if I am the frontend/application developer for some system like recaptcha, am I truly working on ML? Or am I just creating a embeddable web application that serves as an input for ML systems.\n\nIt seems like working in ML is really just the dude making the hypothesis and tuning coefficients. If my job encompassed the entire stack I described above, it would be very interesting for me, but is that a typical scenario?\n\nSorry I'm just brain dumping all my questions right now. I just don't know if I should switch to a team in my company that does ML, only to realize I'm just pumping data, or building web applications.\n\nTo summarize: what does it take to start a career in ML? Please don't recommend me Andrew Ng's coursera course I already took it but I still don't know what people do in the industry.",

However, the part that gets strange is that since I was interviewing for a senior engineering role with only about 1 year of FT experience, they said that a junior/mid level role was probably more appropriate for me, and asked whether or not I was interested in a junior/mid level role, which I agreed and said yes to. The HR recruiter said that she'd follow up with me the next Monday or Tuesday afterwards, which never ended up happening. It's been nearly one week now without the supposed follow up, and I haven't gotten any response to the follow up email I sent to the recruiter.

I am interested in learning about the technical aspect of each career path, but am also interested in what the political/social environments are like, how competitive they are, and just the general experience of what it is like to work in each of these fields.\n\nI am also trying to figure out which of these careers is a best fit for me. I originally wanted to be a developer because I like coding, but they busted me to tester on my first job after completing a not very good bootcamp. Development at the job I'm at right now (banking) seems very competitive, with a lot more to it then learning how to code. I get stuck when someone refuses to merge my pull requests, it always seems like more of a power struggle then an actual concern about the quality of code. Some of my coworkers have taken credit for solutions to problems that I discovered. Arguing and fighting over code doesn't seem to work for me, I'm quieter, don't really want to have to present and defend my work, I just want to find the correct solution to problems that arise.\n\nI feel that the other fields may also be competitive, but that they are nuts and bolts jobs with very clear career paths (Comptia Network +, Security +, Linux +), and also very clear methods of doing things (instead of 50 different design patterns for everyone to argue over). Please let me know if I'm dead wrong :)",

            "selftext": "Hey r/cscareerquestions, \n\nI've already posted this in r/college but I wanted a bit more input from people in the industry. \n\nCurrently I am a first semester freshman at a Penn State branch campus studying IST (Information Science and Technology). Originally, I was planning on staying here all 4 years but after being here for a few weeks I'm not so certain. It's really hard to make friends here as it's a commuter school, and the IST major isn't exactly what I want. From my understanding, the jobs you can get with the  IST is the only major at this campus I'm at all considering, but I'm far more interested in the more in depth technical stuff. The jobs you can get with an IST degree really aren't my cup of tea. Unfortunately I can't major in CS due to crazy entry requirements. \n\nI recently found out that my school has a BS of Computational Data Science which sounds right up my alley and could be the next best thing for me. Big Data is a very interesting, relevant topic to me, and the computational prefix means it'll have lots of normal CS courses, giving me a sort of bastardized CS degree. The jobs you can get with this degree appeal to me far more than IST jobs. To make the deal even sweeter, the entrance to major requirements are attainable, unlike pure CS. Here is a link to the programs website for more information: https://datasciences.psu.edu\n\nSounds all well and good, right? The problem here is cost. The major is only offered at the main campus, which would be quite a bit more expensive. Tuition at my current campus is around 13k for lower level classes, and 15k for upper level (my family and I are already struggling to pay even this, thanks to my parents paying with their limbs for religious private school tuition. Maxed out federal loans aren't even close to enough). Main campus on the other hand, is around 20k, and that's not including room and other fees. Only way I'd be able to afford main campus would be lots of private loans, as my parents are refusing to take out parent loans and they really can't help at all with payment, due to the aforementioned private schools. I'm not going to hedge my bets on scholarships as they are a crapshoot. I've been working on figuring out to do this with minimal debt but it's still going to be tons of money. \n\nTLDR: Do I stay at my current branch campus and do a major I'm not completely interested in, or do I swap majors to Data Science and go to main campus but have to take out substantial private loans for increased tuition and board?\n\nThanks for reading!",

I don't have long lunches either.\n\nWhat surprises me is that all of my team members (5 other developers, including my manager), easily work 9-10 hours a day at least. My manager is online around 8 am each day, and at office around that, and I have seen email responses from him around 10 pm some days, including comments on pull requests which means he is working that late. Not only that, there is a developer on my team who let slip by one day that he was up till 3am the night before, like it was no big deal. What the hell?? Is that generally expected to be up working that long hours in a dev job?\n\nSome more details if it helps, all of the devs on my team are H1-visa holders (from India), I am the only white guy. I wish my team was more diverse, but it is what it is. I don't want to be singled out as the guy who doesn't work as hard just because I leave at 6. What do I do about the situation?",

Although I am not 100% sure what area of IT I would like to work in, I am strongly leaning towards either web or software development.\n\nWhen doing my research, I had initially ruled out the idea of going back to uni (I have a 2:1 in an unrelated discipline) until someone made me aware of the Masters conversion course you can take for computing.\n\nI have been looking at a couple of courses at local unis and am really strongly considering doing one of them:\nhttps://www.sunderland.ac.uk/study/computing/postgraduate-computing\nhttp://www.ncl.ac.uk/postgraduate/courses/degrees/computer-science-msc\n\nI might have missed out on the Newcastle University course, as I haven't spoken to them yet but the course starts in September so may have already commenced. I have spoken to Sunderland University and they have confirmed they still have spaces and are taking applications.\n\nMy concern, is whether it is good use of my time or value for money to take one of these courses?\n\nOne of the things I have noticed with the Sunderland University course is it seems to be very general, covering all facets of IT, and this may leave me short of the skills necessary to go straight into a web developer or software developer role. An advantage of this is I would be able to gain knowledge and experience of all aspects of IT that I would not ordinarily learn about though I suppose. The Newcastle University course does seem to be a lot more focused on programming.\n\nI thought that perhaps I could apply to join a grad scheme after graduating where I could specialise more in the career path I want to pursue, but I don't know whether grad schemes are possibly just for undergraduates?\n\nMy impression is that a great advantage of these courses is I would have an official qualification in computing/computer science. But I am wondering whether I would benefit from doing my own independent studying instead, perhaps on websites like Pluralsight or Udemy for example and practising independently.\n\nFrom my understanding, it seems that it isn't really necessary to get a degree in this area of work, and if you can produce a good portfolio of work that speaks for your abilities that seems to be just as valuable?\n\nI'm really interested to hear from people from the UK who have gone down both routes as I am really torn on whether to go back to uni or not.",

That was on Thursday, which is the day I was going to come back into work to submit my two-weeks to my manager. Seeing that I technically didn't have an offer yet, I ended up taking another day off on top of the two spontaneous days that I took.\n\nI did the next round, they went great, and I established great rapport with the director of the org that I will be joining. Later that day I received an offer from another company, so I was able to go into the office on Friday and quit. This company that I want to work at will have an offer for me by EOD Monday, so I'm all set there.\n\nMy manager was very reasonable about it. He seemed a bit surprised, but understood. However, he really wants to know for future reference what my problems were with working there. I didn't really have a whole lot to tell him, it was more of a \"feeling\" thing. I told him that it was a bad culture fit, but he wanted to know what I meant by that. When I left the meeting, he told me that on my last day he wanted to have an exit interview and in the meantime I should really think about what about working there is bothering me, and what would have to be done to improve it. He's not trying to get me to stay, but he wants concrete reasons from me.\n\nI'm not really sure what to do there. ~~I'm going to jot down some bullshit that I can tell him just to get him off my back, and if I come up with some actual reasons I'll throw those in as well.~~ I am going to try but most of my concrete reasons have been fairly small. At the end of the day, I'm miserable at the job and I want out, I don't really care to look into my exact reasons, no matter how nice of a guy my manager is. I thought \"it's a bad culture fit\" and \"it's not the kind of company I want to work for\" would be sufficient. I guess not...\n\nWell, at least I have a new job that aligns much more closely with my ideal situation to look forward to!\n\nThanks for the help, CSCQ!\n\nEDIT: After reading back on the post I wrote this morning, it seems I came across way more insensitive than I was intending. This last week was very stressful for me, what with all the interviews and then having to put in my two weeks. I don't like having to do this stuff, and having to stay at a job that I hate while I do it has made me extremely bitter. I had a very relaxing day and have revised my post to reflect my actual thoughts.",

I really enjoyed these classes, but in my mind what I learned in those classes isn't what CS professionals actually do. However, most of my classes were 1000 and 2000 level (aka first and second year classes). \n\nIn those classes, we were given problem sets like \"write a function that accepts a string and removes all the vowels, then rearranges the remaining characters in alphabetical order\" or \"write a function that displays a user interface with a button that adds one to a counter\". \n\nMy question is, what do people in the CS field actually DO? Like if you're working on the backend security for a military satellite, I highly doubt that you're writing these types of functions that somehow protect the satellite. If you're working on some feature at Facebook, I doubt you are writing these one-off functions, right? \n\nI guess I have a hard time actually visualizing how programming can be used outside of just solving these trivial homework problems. What does your work actually LOOK like? When you're in a meeting at work, what are you discussing? \"Write an if statement here, that will allow the satellite to orbit the earth\" just doesn't compute in my brain. \n\nI know I'm very ignorant and uninformed on this subject - I genuinely just want to learn what the work actually looks like. Is it work done in a compiler in a programming language? Are there software packages you use to assemble these types of programs?

My background is probably a bit different than most on here. Right after (high school) graduation, I went into an IT program that essentially gave me college credits, 6 months of IT training, and a 6 month internship with a Fortune 10 company.\n\nAfter the internship with the F10 company, I got picked up for a long term contract with a gov. agency though a consulting company. Perks are great, recently got a 7% raise (year before that 10% raise, although my initial comp was a bit below average so I think it was more of a correction). \n\nMy dilemma: I keep getting calls from recruiters regarding other positions, now that I'm a bit more \"experienced\". Most I have declined due to the location being kinda crappy, or pay too low, but there was one not too long ago I actually went through with the interview for and essentially got an offer for about 10k more than I was making at the time, and the opportunity to be the head of my own department as a DBA. Ultimately I decided I wasn't really interested because I like my team (and just having a team) of 3 db people, and would have had to drive to get to this other place in a reasonable time frame (I currently just take the subway, so that would be a downgrade).\n\nMy question is, seeing as though I still don't have my degree yet (expected to get my BA in about 2+ years, AA this fall), I'm worried that if I take another job, and don't like it, I won't be credentialed enough to proactively go out and find another gig easily due the lack of degree. Probably sounds stupid considering I am getting calls despite that currently, but I'm just having a hard time determining if its time for me to move on yet. My boss loves my performance, and our contract seems to be on track to be renewed again, but at the same time 2 senior devs have left over the past year, and another mid level dev almost left for a higher paying gig before he got matched for 15% more. Granted, the two senior devs had been there for about 3+ years, but the work eventually gets dull after a while. \n\nIn IT, does it look better to be a one place for 3-5 years, or a lot of places for maybe 1-2 years at a time?",

At first I was very excited about the move, because courses at my original university felt boring and unchallenging. So far, the courses here have been slightly more challenging, which is nice.\n\nHowever, now that I'm here, I've noticed that many of other CS majors here around my age are very focused on one particular aspect of computer science. I've met other Juniors who are focused on financial tech, blockchain use, machine learning, startups and more very specific domains of CS.\n\nThis prompted me to think about what parts of CS I was interested in, and I drew a blank. I honestly have no clue what I want to do with this major. This past summer I built a back-end for a friend's startup's website, but I only got paid in (bullshit) equity and worked way too much for no pay. I really didn't enjoy that type of development, but since that's now the only thing of note on my resume, I'm worried I'll be typecast as a \"back-end dev\".\n\nI've heard people say that I should join clubs or work on side projects to find out what I'm interested in and buff my resume. However, I was rejected from the few CS clubs I applied for this semester, and I have no clue what side projects I should even do.\n\nI guess ultimately, while I like Computer Science, I just feel lost within it.

            "selftext": "First, a little background: I'm a fourth year student at a non-target school (i.e. not Waterloo) in Canada. My school has a co-op program but it's not the greatest. I've completed two internships, one with the government and the other at a bank, both of which were mediocre experiences. My GPA is pretty much exactly 3.0. I have some simple side projects (mostly webscrapers) and participated in a few hackathons. Realistically, I\u2019d rate myself slightly below average. I'm currently doing my first semester of fourth year, leaving me with just one semester left to graduate. Originally I planned to just do that final semester in Winter 2018, as normal, and just graduate.\n\n\nHowever.\n\n\nI really don't yet feel confident graduating yet. I don't think I really have enough value to actually be worth hiring. I've considered a masters, but I don\u2019t really have much going for me GPA or research wise. My dad works in IT and is telling me the job market is pretty tough right now and I assume it's only getting worse. I feel like if I just graduate, I\u2019ll have a very tough time finding a job. If, instead, I find an internship the coming semester, then there is a chance I could just work at that place after I graduate. \"So... just do an internship!\", you might say. Well, there\u2019s a complication.\n\nBasically, due the way courses are offered at my school, the specific courses I need to graduate are only offered in Winter semesters. In other words, if I went on co-op in the coming winter (i.e. Winter 2018), I'd have to wait until Winter 2019 to take those courses. That leaves 8 months in between. I don't want to take any time off though. I need to either be working or studying. This means that I would have to aim for a year long co-op somewhere and basically just be on co-op for all of 2018. I'd imagine if I worked at a company for a year (and didn't do anything stupid), I would stand a good chance at getting hired there. But is this really worth my time? I already feel so behind my peers in terms of knowledge and career, so if it turns out to be a shitty co-op I don\u2019t want to return to, I'll just have worked at a company for half their regular salary and delayed my graduation by a year. Though I hope it won\u2019t be the case, considering my school's co-op listings, it will most probably be at another bank or government branch again, which tend to be mediocre (at least from my experience).  Of course I could always apply outside my schools available co-op listings, but I've been doing that since 2nd year and I've never gotten a positive reply from anything.\n\nI feel pretty conflicted and am not sure what to do. I\u2019d appreciate some insight or advice, especially from other Canadians.",

I've learned quite a bit from my internship so far, like basic MySQL commands and about Selenium (the browser automation tool in Python that I use to scrape data). When I joined, 8 states could be scraped by the system; now it's at 35 states.\n\nEven though I'm satisfied with the day to day work, I *still* feel inadequate; I feel like this internship isn't impressive enough when I'll be talking to companies during career fairs this year. This has been my only relevant experience outside of the classroom (~3.2-3.3 GPA).\n\nShould I be worried that my internship isn't enough to talk about to impress/ talk with companies? Part of me thinks I might be overthinking things and part of me thinks that my one measly internship isn't enough to impress recruiters/companies to land a full time position.\n\nThanks in advance for any input!!

Last month my manager hit me with a Performance Improvement Plan on a timeline of a couple months, saying \nsuddenly that I am low performer, which seems to me like a thinly veiled way to present me with the initial steps for my dismissal.\n\n\nOf course, my coworkers have told me that nobody on my team ordered this, and that I was doing a good job, which makes it seem like a unilateral management move (as I expected). Even my manager, who is being forced to fire me, has told me that if I need a positive reference, that he would provide me with one. Sounds to me like it's coming from above him.\n\nI think the motivation for this is probably so that my company does not have to report a layoff as a layoff, and so they're calling it a termination for cause (maybe so they don't have to dole out severance/unemployment? Not sure), with the reason being low performance.\n\nWeirdly, it seems also like I am succeeding at the plan (which was filled with what I think are tasks they *THOUGHT* I couldn't do, but which I never saw as insurmountable and was able to check them off)\n\nIn any case, as any rational person would do, I immediately started applying for other jobs as *SOON* as my manager gave me the news, and I have some really great prospects coming up with some big name companies, and other prospects with mid-sized and smaller companies if need be. Is there anything that I have missed or anything that I am doing wrong? I'm open to any advice!

This December I got a degree in System Analysis and Development and I consider myself fairly skilled at it. I understand the concepts of OOP, unit testing, design patterns, etc. I also did pretty well during my internship period in another company, though I was not \"officially\" hired as a programmer then, but that's another story.\n\nAnyway, now I'm working as a junior dev at a small company. I don't know if it's because it's my first full-time job, but I'm feeling overwhelmed with the workload. Can you offer me some advice? \n\nEveryday my boss sends me an e-mail containing the task list for the day. They are prioritized in whatever order he negotiated with the customers. In a typical day, I have 6~8 tasks to do. If the task is easy enough, I take from 30 minutes to maybe 2 hours at most to finish it. The ones that involve implementing new features or drastically changing the already existing ones can take me up to 8 hours to finish.\n\nThat means the other tasks get delayed, of course. However, my task list keeps growing and growing because I can't seem to finish them as fast as my boss expects me to and he keeps assigning me more work. I've already discussed this issue with him, and also offered some suggestions that could help me get things done faster, but the situation hasn't improved at all. The codebase I'm working in is also kinda old, so it has a few problems like the lack of unit tests, duplicated code, inline SQL, you know, *the stuff*, but I preferred not to bring this up.\n\nHas anyone here ever felt like this before?  At this point I'm pretty close to just give up and quit, since I think I won't be able to cope with it for much longer. \n\ntldr; I'm feeling overwhelmed at my job because I'm expected to finish everything very fast but I can't and my task list keeps growing every day",

Basically a bunch of companies that are currently on 'breakout' trajectory in terms of growth. The website gives many arguments for joining one of these companies.\n\nMy reasoning before was that big-4 and co offer high salaries(short term) and set you up well for future opportunities (long term) whether those are future jobs or starting a startup. Their prestige (ex-googler or whatever) makes it easier to get interviews or meetings with investors. Their also good places to meet other smart people including potential cofounders. They just ticked all the boxes for someone like me who wanted to open as many future options as possible.\n\nI also want to make as much money as possible though. I asked [this question](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4u4osy/how_can_i_earn_a_lot_of_money_after_working_only/) once but it seemed unrealistic to make more than average without working extra hard.\n\n\nI'm currently might leave my job after only 9-10 months and want to stay at my next job for at least 2 years.

I like what I read . Obviously doesn't matter unless I get multiple offers. \n\nI'm turning 24 and I want maximum upside in terms of money, prestige and skill development over the next 4 years with a slightly higher than average level of effort.

I have taken courses in iOS, Android, Rails, and Databases and made a few apps and websites. \n\nI would like to start freelancing, because I work as a part-time HS CS teacher for about 20 hours a week. It's just barely not enough income, so I'd like to take on some other work, and freelancing seems like a good option because hours are flexible. Ideally, I want to start making e-commerce apps or any kind of apps clients would like. I'm worried about a number of things, however. \n\nFirst, I'm mostly worried about security. I don't know what I don't know in security, and I always hear stories about issues of security, with Equifax and various DoS attacks and viruses. I feel this is my biggest block in wanting to do freelancing. Another thing is appearance. I don't know CSS and graphics (or front-end in general) very well, so I fear that I would make an ugly product. And finally, I'm worried about the whole process of deployment. I don't really know best practices for when to modify data in Debug/Release versions of the product, or in general how to do large-scale product management.\n\nHow can I become stronger on these issues, get the knowledge I need and build a set of best practices? I feel like getting an industry job would be the best experience, but that's not an option right now because I'm currently a teacher until June.\n\nThanks!",

They sometimes talk in between each other and I can't even contribute because I have no idea what they are talking about. It is so discouraging. I feel so... mediocre... I can't even imagine ever reaching their level no matter how hard I try.\n\nLooking around on the internet makes it even worse, I see 15 year olds publishing games FFS! When I was 15 I was still playing with stuffed animals and barely knew how to turn on a computer! I just find it so discouraging and sometimes I think I'm just naturally not smart enough and at this point I will always be the junior of any office I work at.\nAnyway, I do understand that the internet is not exemplary of how things really are, but the other examples I am using are guys I work with directly!\n\nI've been dedicating my off time to make an npm package which I am very proud of, then I look at them and it seems like nothing. Anyone who can move their fingers could probably do my personal projects.\n\nDoes anyone else feel this way sometimes? If so, how do you deal with it and not let yourself get down?\n\n**tl;dr: everyone around me seems to have all these ultra complex and huge projects, I am starting to feel down and don't believe I'll ever reach that point.

You're just out of school, you don't have kids or much responsibilities. You'll also learn more things faster because you're likely to wear multiple hats. \n\nBut I was saying its better to work at a more established company/startup first. You get some money which you can save and collect interest on for later years. You'll also add some credibility to your resume if things go south. And you'll definitely learn some technical & non-technical stuff working at more established places first. \n\nI'm definitely a little biased because I'm not a very adventurous person.

            "selftext": "I know many posts have exhausted midwest salary discussion and the accompanying cost of living argument. So rather than harp on that further, I wanted to talk about the CS workplace culture in the midwest.\n\nIf you include internships, I have been working in midwest CS for about 5 years. Additionally, many of my graduating class and former coworkers have all been midwest lifers. \nWhen I visited SF this past winter, the cs culture was very different than the one I\u2019ve been working in. \n\nAfter talking to about 10 cs friends, here are some interesting cultural nuances that seem to be prevalent in midwest CS.\n\n\nIn the Midwest:\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe good:\n\n- No one works long hours here. Every once in a while someone might get caught up in something until 5:30, but for the most part 5pm means driving home and seeing family/friends.\n\n- Management or ownership doesn't really have an expectation of the former, it helps that they are heading for the door at 5pm as well.\n\n- Quitting / Poaching happens less. This might be related to a lower salary cap in the area, but it's not uncommon to run into developers who have been at the same place for 5+ years. There are also no underlying talent acquisition rivalries between any big companies.\n\n- interviews are easy and usually interpersonal based, very rare to see a whiteboard or algorithm question.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe not so good:\n\n- No such thing as catered lunch / free food / fully stocked fridge. I was amazed that this is a weekly and sometimes daily thing on the west coast. There is no expectation from workers or employers that food is provided.\n\n- No lifestyle benefits - company gyms or rec centers are very rare. Sometimes there's a subsidy program through a local gym, but that\u2019s not really the same thing. Fringe things like laundry, haircuts, child care, etc is also not a thing.\n\n- Non existent remote work policies -  most places allow a  sick dev to work from home (with supervisor permission), but almost no workplace has a remote policy that allows any sort of habit of it. Very much a \"if we don't see you how can we know you're working\" undertone.\n\n- Flexible hours aren't a thing. There is no such thing as come in when it's best for you and leave ~8 hours later. Dev's need to be in their seat by 9am every morning.\n\n- Signing bonuses or more-than-salary equity packages are unheard of. Holiday bonuses are a thing, however.\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\nWest coasters, what do you think? Mid western, is this in line with your experiences? Hoping to discuss?",

I have done a couple automations already and I'm sure I am saving the company alot of money. My questions are 1) is there demand out there for process automation jobs? Sometimes I feel like I'm wasting time working on automating stuff because I'd rather be programming so I can improve (I'm a new grad). However, if it's something I could make a  career out of or even just put on a resume that'd be great. 2) Should I feel bad about possibly taking people out of jobs by developing these automations? That thought constantly crosses my mind and makes me question my morals. Anyways, process automation is relatively new to me so I wanted to see what anybody thought. ",

            "selftext": "TL;DR: I want to take 2-3 months off work to improve my technical abilities so I can move on to a job doing more technically challenging work. E.g. ML/AI, distributed systems, data analytics. Any tips?\n\nI've been with my current company for a few years, and while it's been a great for things like soft skills, writing maintainable code, etc, I'm getting a bit bored of doing relatively straight-forward software development. The challenges where I work lie mostly on the management side of things (i.e. dealing with limited budgets/time frames, which isn't where I want to go career-wise), so my technical skills have gotten a bit rusty. This was made evident when I recently interviewed at an AI company and after four rounds of interviews (two phone, one online test, one in person) the feedback was that they found my technical abilities lacking overall. I therefore want to revisit the subjects I enjoyed so much in Uni and get back on top of things.\n\nNow I'm not someone that lives and breathes code, I like to keep my evenings free to play music, go out, relax. In fact I purposely try to not think about work in my spare time in order to do the best job I can during work hours. I'd therefore don't want to spend all my time working on code challenges after work for months on end. I fortunately have enough savings to stay out of work for up to six months, so my plan is to wait until after I get my bonus and revise full time for a while.\n\nMy rough plan so far is:\n\n* Work through 'Cracking the coding interview' to revise algorithms & data structures\n* Do a few Coursera courses (unsure how many I can fit in), e.g. the Standford one on Deep learning\n* Use python as much as possible (seems to be widely used for the kind of work I'm interested in)\n* Stick to a schedule so I don't just slack off\n* Make a list of companies I want to apply to and start applying 1-2 months in\n* Work on a personal project, e.g. a StarCraft AI (/r/sc2ai) as I have some experience with reinforcement learning from my Masters dissertation\n* Admit defeat if I haven't gotten anywhere after 3 months and go back to where I currently work or otherwise lower my expectations\n\nOne thing that I'm not sure how to cover are technologies for non-trivial use-cases that might be useful to have some experience in, e.g. Kubernetes, Cassandra, Neo4j, even AWS. Some pointers for this would be useful.\n\n\n...does this sounds like a good idea at all? Would companies think I got fired if I write \"3 months sabbatical to work on X/Y/Z\" on my CV? Am I biting off more than I can chew? Any other tips? I have never done anything remotely as risky as this.\n\nThanks a lot for any input!",

            "selftext": "I live in Brazil. I know some people think it's an almost-developed big country, but it's actually a lawless shithole where the mid/upper classes are not so affected by it because they hide themselves in  the safest places. We're all hostages. The law simply doesn't work here, period. Except maybe for the labor laws.\n\nI work for one of the giant tech multi-national companies, I make a very good salary, my wife has a good job, so I never really considered moving: we're in a comfortable and safe position and we can use our money to stay relatively safer, hiding ourselves from the bad things that happen around here.\n\nThat was until today. Today (a Saturday morning), in our nice upper class neighborhood, my wife was walking on the street and someone tried to steal our 1-year-old son. Long story short, she was able to run away and now we want to get the hell out of this lawless shithole before we get our lives actually affected by it. I have done some research and it seems that children kidnapping is a type of crime that is increasing around here. I truly believe there's a 0% chance this crime would ever get solved in case it happened.\n\nI know 99% of the people here will recommend me to try San Francisco, since it's where the money is. But I've been to SF and I don't think it's the appropriate place for me: I already have a family, and all I want is a place where my kids can grow up happily, without having to worry about being kidnapped, shot, bombed or suffer from Xenophobia. Obviously, I also don't want to worry about money (which is something I have accomplished here, but my money is worth nothing if I move to a dollar/euro place). It seems SF is a place where I'll never be able to afford a house, and I'll have to spend hours every day commuting. I'd definitely go to SF if I was single, but I'm not sure it's a good place for work/life balance.\n\nIdeally, I want to go to a place where:\n\n* People are safe, there is (almost) no crime.\n* There's no Xenophobia\n* There are plenty of tech jobs for people like me, who do low-level C/OS/Linux programming.\n* There's a culture of good work/life balance, i.e., working overtime is not the norm or even idealized.\n* Pay is nice.\n* My wife can also find a job for her.\n* Quality of life is good.\n* My kids have access to good education (free is preferable)\n* My kids can have a future\n* My kids won't be bullied in school\n* People actually hire foreigners\n\nIf I try to move through my current employer, the only possibility is a specific place in the US Northwest. How safe is life out there? I have heard that even though the US is a relatively safe place, it's not exactly as safe as other countries. Also, I kinda worry about the current wave of Xenophobia that may have increased with Trump: will it affect me? Will I suddenly get kicked out of the US since Trump woke up in a bad mood? Another thing that worries me is that work/life balance doesn't seem to be the best in US: workaholics seem to be a little bit idealized there. That said, I've been to the US multiple times and I do think there are many many many advantages over my current situation, but that does not stop me from wondering about the possible downsides. Another thing that worries me is healthcare, since *everybody* in my family always has to fight cancer after they're in their 50s.... I don't want to suddenly have to spend all my life savings on a health issue.\n\nI also considered moving to somewhere in Europe (I recently obtained an European citizenship!), but it looks like Xenophobia is also on the rise there. It seems to me that Germany is a nice place for tech people like me, but German would definitely be a tough language for us to learn... I've also been to Switzerland and loved that country. Italy also has a nice weather, but I never hear about anything tech related there. And every single Finnish I met is extremely intelligent, so I suppose it has a good education system for my kids (although the weather sucks a lot there). Another nice thing about Europe is that work/life balance seems much better there than in the US. But sill, I don't know... People seem to complain that pay is not that great there.\n\nAnother place I considered is Canada. It seems the quality of life there is actually pretty good, the people seem to be nice and I don't think there's a lot of Xenophobia going on there. What makes me sad is that everybody seems to say the pay there is bad... To be honest, if my company allowed me to move to Canada I'd probably ask them right away. Another huge plus of Canada is the fact that they speak English there (I'm only fluent in English and Portuguese).\n\nTo close: I hate the fact that this is relevant, but my skin color is White (that may affect Xenophobia).\n\nConsidering all of this, which place seems to be a good choice? I know most of this post is just a rant/venting, but I'm kinda just generally looking for advice/opinions about my situation. Anything you could say that would help me make a decision would be appreciated.\n\nSome links for those doubting how lawless is Brazil:\n\n* http://g1.globo.com/jornal-da-globo/noticia/2014/04/maioria-dos-crimes-no-brasil-nao-chega-ser-solucionada-pela-policia.html\n* http://g1.globo.com/globo-news/noticia/2016/11/inqueritos-de-homicidios-por-todo-o-brasil-sao-arquivados-em-massa.html\n* https://mundoestranho.abril.com.br/curiosidades/qual-a-porcentagem-de-crimes-solucionados-pela-policia-no-brasil/\n* http://www.tribunapr.com.br/noticias/curitiba-regiao/tentativas-de-rapto-de-criancas-reforcam-necessidade-de-cuidados-veja-como-se-proteger/\n\nThanks for reading up to this.\n\nEdit: a little more info.",

Resume posted at the bottom.\n\nSome background:\n\n- Graduated ~9 months ago from university with cs degree and decent GPA\n\n- Little to no technical experience outside of school\n\n- Not a lot of projects to show for outside of school\n\nI graduated about 9 months ago from college and I haven't been able to land any offers. I've had a few final round interviews, but they've ended in rejection with very little feedback. I've been studying CtCI and doing leetcode to help with the technical interviews, and, at the same time, trying to work on a side project I enjoy, but progress is slow due to having to learn new things like Node, Angular, etc. \nI'm considering bootcamps like Hack Reactor and App Academy to get more projects I can show that involve those tools that companies look for. I would continue trying to learn them on my own, but self-teaching isn't really my forte, and I feel the structure of a class would help me greatly. \n\nAt this point, I feel like my \"new grad\" status has expired, and my unemployment gap has become some sort of repellant to companies. Should I just continue applying to various companies with a bare bones resume (while trying to beef it up), or should I consider a bootcamp to boost my coding exp and maybe add a few projects while I'm at it?

            "selftext": "Hey yall\n\nA couple weeks ago I've been complaining about tech interviews, but I continued to grind and study and as a result I passed almost every phone screen from then on. I will have 3 onsite interviews in the upcoming week including 1 bigN company and another 1 or 2 the week after so its going to be brutal but I think from a problem solving prospective I'll be able to do ok. Most of my issues are through phone screens since I get nervous since I can't see the interviewer and their reaction, so naturally I'm better onsite. however onsite interviews may have more difficult questions and you need to go through hours of interviews. I'm confident that I belong since I made it this far, but also nervous that they will somehow ask the one question I draw a blank on. I've been doing research on the questions the companies ask and even if I dont get any of those questions during the interview, I was able to solve most of them (but not under pressure) \n\nSo my question is what is your favorite way to prepare for an onsite interview two days before? I can cram like crazy but not sure if that will help. Just wondering what useful tips people have to ensure they are their best selves during the onsites. \n\nAlso I haven't really done a system design interview before but I have worked 3 jobs already so I've got a good amount of experience with this and think this is actually my strength. Perhaps system design interviews are different when the interviewers are looking for more concrete answers (like with code) rather than thinking about different data storages/ scalability / concurrency issues? What are your experiences with system design interviews onsite? \n\nThanks!!",

I switched primarily because I consider myself very logic-oriented, as well as excelling in math and deduction. \n\nSince switching majors I've done pretty well in my classes. I've gotten both A's in Calc 1 and 2 as well as a B+ in my physics class. \n\nBut I don't know SHIT about programming! I'm currently taking programming II and it's still a struggle for me to write a simple Java program that prints out a list of prime numbers. \n\nI'm depressed because I had a year and a half since switching majors to actually learn how to code. Unfortunately, I work at a restaurant as well to pay for my rent, food, and car. Between studying for classes and working at the restaurant there is simply no motivation left in me to program in my free time. \n\nFurthermore, I don't BELIEVE that studying computer science will lead me to a job someday. At 22, I know less programming than a 14 year old learning to program, which is fucking embarrassing. At my age, people are already getting programming jobs in top tech companies and here I am, struggling to insert elements into an array.\n\nI just don't know what to fucking do. I currently work 35 hours but I can definitely trim it down to 15-20 a week to make more time for studying. The main problem is that I don't believe studying will bring me any closer to a high paying job after college. \n\nIt's depressing as hell going into work at my restaurant and wondering every day if I'll ever be able to be anything better or if I'm going to be a server my entire life until I'm too ugly to show my face to the guests. From then on end, its working in the back of house until I'm too old to be useful anymore. \n\nWhat do I do? How do I break out of my slump? Perhaps I should just consider a change of major AGAIN? Perhaps a mathematics major?

Now that the project was pulled, he has me reading random papers (that he himself hasn't read) and has me doing a task that has no research or business impact.\n\nI like this company a lot, and wanted to work there fulltime eventually, but I am applying to phd programs this semester and throwing 8 hours a day down the drain is not acceptable (I should be working on other research and writing my apps).

He also said he wanted to have me split my time (80% software, 20% research), which is not what I signed up for. \n\nIs my justification reasonable for wanting to quit the internship? Are there any repercussions that I should be wary of if I decide to quit? I was thinking of emailing HR and asking if it would be possible to move my internship to this summer, at another office on another team. Is this a reasonable request?

Since the path to employment in the industry is less structured than any other skilled careers that I know of I've cobbled together numerous resources that I've come across.  Roast me.  If there are skills that you think I need please tell me.  I could really use advice from people who have been in the industry for a while.\n\nCompleted:\n\n* Harvard's [CS50](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x) up through Web Dev\n* [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/): Learn HTML & CSS, Learn Javascript, and Learn Command Line\n * I know these aren't worth much\n* [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) up to the portion on APIs\n * Quit because I greatly disliked their teaching method.\n* Colt Steele's [Web Dev Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/) up through RESTful routing\n* [Javascript: Understanding the Weird Parts](https://www.udemy.com/understand-javascript/) (50% done)  \n* [You Don't Know JS:](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS) Up & Going + Scope & Closures\n\nMy current plan is to concurrently complete Javascript: Understanding the Weird Parts, You Don't Know JS, [Deep Javascript Foundations](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/javascript-foundations/learn/) (a course created by the writer of You Don't Know JS), and [Git a Web Developer Job](https://www.udemy.com/git-a-web-developer-job-mastering-the-modern-workflow/).  While I want to get a job as quickly as possible I do not want to cut corners.  I want to truly understand how to take advantage of JS.\n\nAfter this I plan on following [this guide](https://github.com/P1xt/p1xt-guides/blob/master/job-ready.md) and then start applying to jobs.  After I get a job, or if I still don't have a job, I'll continue with [this guide](https://github.com/P1xt/p1xt-guides/blob/master/wd-cs.md).\n\nI currently have no portfolio at the moment so I have nothing to show for my current progress.  I'm pretty sick of my current career and where I live but I have plenty of free time on my hands.  I intend to relocate to the Denver area where from my understanding the job market for web devs isn't terrible (although I don't know what it's like for junior developers).  I have plenty of money saved up so I'm constantly contemplating moving and then getting a job rather than securing one beforehand.  It's incredibly difficult to even get the time of day from an employer as someone without experience who lives across the country.  I say all of this to explain that I want to get to a place where my experience and portfolio could easily get me employed in a junior position in a short period of time.  My current education is a Bachelor's in Business Administration with a minor in Entrepreneurship.  I know that having a fleshed out portfolio is the best way to get a job but I struggle to come up with projects to work on.  That is why a good chunk of these courses include projects I can fill a portfolio with.  If anyone can suggest resources on projects that I can both learn from and show an employer my knowledge I would greatly appreciate it.\n\nThank you in advance for any advice that you can give.  I know these questions are asked quite frequently but I could really use some help for my particular situation and chosen learning path.",

You guys have helped me a lot and many others as well.\n\nSo about me - I'm a graduating senior and looking for a full-time position. I interned over the summer as SWE at company X. Company X liked me and gave me a Letter of Intent to come back. They asked me \"when do you want to start?\" and I have not replied yet. They have not given me a deadline either yet but have given me follow-up emails which I have ignored as well.\n\nThe reason why I have not replied back yet is because I do not like working in the city I interned at and also I want to become a PM instead of a SWE. I also have an interview coming up with company Y (big 4) for a PM position. So basically I'm asking what you guys would do in my situation.\n\n\n**a.** Tell company X a start date and look at the offer they give me then ask for another position/city they can offer me.\n\n**b.** Ask company X for another position/city w/o looking at the offer.\n\n**c.** Wait until my interview with company Y is done with and then reply back to company X.",

            "selftext": "Please excuse me if my questions seems weird or dumb, I've never done contract work before so I'm not really sure what to do / what to expect when it comes to contract agreements and working as a contractor\n\nThe basics of the work I plan on doing is to pull real time data from an API and store it in a database in order to create daily reports. This API is going to be hit every 5 or so minutes and the data is transformed and put into a DB. At the end of the day, a job will run to generate a report of this data and store it in an S3 bucket. I plan on using AWS Lambda to run the job ever 5 minutes and use AWS RDS to store the data in a mySQL db. I have a good idea of how long it is going to take me but I'm not sure how the contractural agreement works before i actually start the work. \n\nSome questions i have regarding contracts \n\n1. Am I the one who is supposed to provide a contract for them? or do they send me something that I am supposed to sign?\n  * I've done some research and found contract agreement templates online, but I'm not sure if I'm supposed to send them one or they send me one\n\n2. when it comes to doing maintenance after the work is completed, how does that work usually?\n  * Should this be mentioned in the contract or is it something that is just kind of done at will and billed for\n\n\nI'm sure all of these questions differ from company to company but I would like to hear your opinion on what you've done in the past and what is the best to do. \n\nsome other misc questions:\n\n1. For AWS stuff, should i set it up via a shared email address or should I just have them set it up with a private email address? \n  * They will be adding the credit card information to the account. I'm not sure if I will ever need access to the actual email the AWS account is set up for or if just having access to the AWS dashboard for the account is fine.\n2. As far as AWS services go, is Lambda and RDS the right way to go? The code to be executed is pretty quick and the amount of data being pulled from the API is ~170kb. I figured this would be an easier / cheaper route to go than to use EC2 to set up jobs and a database on. The amount of data being stored is ~ 2-3 GB a month \n3. Before we set up a contract, I will provide them the following information based on the initial call i had with them today. Do I need to / should I provide them with anything else?\n  * My pay rate and estimated time to finish the work\n  * My understanding of the requirements based on the call\n  * A document with the estimated monthly costs of all the AWS services\n\n\nThanks again for any advice you guys have on this, I'm new to the contracting world so any advice or criticism would be wonderful",

Said he'll match my offer (20k), and that we have stuff in the works for getting devs to use kinesis and Lambda while getting more involved in AWS. Not as much as the other opportunity, but it's still something. I also get unlimited vacation and a max of 4% 401k match here.\n\nNew opportunity gives me no 401k match and 4 weeks of vacation (which is still respectable). But since I've already accepted, and the VP called me personally when I had initially rejected to give me a better offer, it will definitely burn a bridge. \n\nSo how does one decide if the counter offer is worth it? I've been told before not to buy into the flattery. I've also been told that if you accept the counter, you become easily replaceable, as they can search for your replacement as you're working there.

And I have put in my two weeks notice because of this.\n\nI work for a major company that was in the news for a data breach more than 6 months ago.  Since then, security training is all over the place.\n\nI got a new manager, who is impossible to get anything done other than delegating work and makes assumptions blaming people without reading her own email.\n\nA Sr. Developer was hired, and technical decisions went through him.  This developer wrote code that was addressed to my manager, but said basically \"He's the tech lead\".\n\nOK, I get that.  \n\nThis functionality calls a rest api to retrieve reports.  A new developer was trying to fix an unrelated problem with this code, and could not get a simple question answered from this guy.  I feel bad for him, and when this was delegated back to me, I just wanted to do whatever I could to help this guy who's spent 3 weeks on something that could be answered in a few minutes.\n\nSo the goal was to isolate the problem to the source and eliminate any variables that were not related.  This got us down to the api call to communicate.  \n\nThe security issue was there (I forgot about it), and helping this new guy out, I discovered that on a production environment filled with the company's financial transactions. \n\nOK, so what.  This unsecure call is posting insecurely the server's network administrator account and password.  \n\nTo me, that's something bad.\n\nImmediately, I called my boss who referred me back to the guy who wrote the code.  I responded back, There might be an easy way to get financial data, elevated, and this isn't a big deal?\n\nFinally, she starts asking the typical response questions.  Why did this happen?  Who did this?  Why didn't code scanning catch this?\n\nSo I was asked to write up technically what I found, how, step by step and send it to the team.  She said to call this guy immediately, which I did.  I left a message.\n\nLater that evening, she sends a follow up email, asking him to look into this.  \n\nWe're 4 hours into the work day, and I have not heard any response.  I can't think of anything I could possibly say that wouldn't warrant anyone's attention to even look at something like this.\n\nI don't see the point in even caring.  The company that's teaching us to do what's right, report things and I can't even get an email, or text message saying \"OK\".\n\nEDIT:  This is one of many instances spanning over many projects.

Since it started I have gone to multiple interviews, done one technical interview and applied to hundreds of places (mainly local, some out of state).\n\nI have slaved away at a personal project that I am very proud of and I have repeatedly been told that companies will be 'begging' to hire me because I do this kind of shit in my free time. I was naive enough to believe this wholeheartedly and it has led to some disappointment.\n\nI also do about 10-15 hours/ week of freelance work for barely above minimum wage on top of my 40 hour work week, preparing for interviews, working on my personal project, and applying to numerous positions. \n\nI got rejected today from the only company whom I've ever made it to the technical interview round and that really stung. I have two more interviews lined up next week but I'm trying not to get my hopes up. I also live in a relatively small area (probably 300,000 people within a 25 mile radius) with limited developer opportunities. Do I need to move to Austin (closest \"tech hub\") to find a good paying job?\n\n[here](https://imgur.com/a/NnEsg) is my resume. The formatting is kind of messed up because I have to edit it in word online because I haven't paid for Word yet. I'm really tired of getting rejection after rejection, whether it be after I send in my resume or after the initial phone screen. I made a folder called \"rejections\" back in my Junior year because I wanted to look at it once I finally received an offer so that I could look back and see how far I have come, but it has probably five hundred emails now :(\n\nAny help would be much appreciated, and thank you!",

I'm going to be doing my school's version of co-op in the upcoming year and I have a few questions regarding jobs in general since I'll graduate soon and go out looking for jobs.\n\nFor now I guess I'm a jack of all trades, master of none. I know things from C++/Java/Python but more recently, I've been getting heavily involved with web development and I've been thoroughly learning NodeJS and the MEAN stack.\n\nI still don't know which type of field I want to go into. I'm learning Python in school, I'm learning Machine Learning and Data Mining from my school, and I'm learning Node and webdev on my own time. And I love them all.\n\nI just really enjoy coding, but if I were to call myself something now, it'd probably be a web developer.\n\nSo my question is, can a person go from Web developer to Software Engineer and vice versa without too much issue?\n\nSince I love coding as a whole, my next option, as shallow as it is, was to look at salary. And software engineers are near the top. However most of what I've been focusing on is web technologies. Did I kind of waste my time? Even though I almost only fully understand web dev, can I still apply as a software engineer/make it as one? Also while looking at my cities positions, there's much much more software engineering jobs than web dev jobs. Will I be ready in a couple months for my position (I'm assuming I'll be placed as a software engineer). I ask this also because I see people learning all about sorting algorithms, trees, heaps, data structures, and many other things. However with webdev I haven't gotten much exposure to all of this (but luckily in University I did, tho a while ago and I don't remember too much). So will I be kind of behind the curve even though I've been putting hours into learning.\n\n(To give an idea of what I can do as I am right now, I've made my own social media platform from scratch so I can probably clone Facebook (but not the algorithm it uses on their feed))\n\nThank you all!\n\nPS/Side Note: Then there's also the option of doing machine learning since that would be my degree. In the end there's so many paths and I don't know how to choose one. How did you make this decision on which path to follow?",

I'm currently enrolled in a Computer Science taught master's and I'm in the process of choosing my subjects. I was wondering if anyone could give my a bit of advice.\n\nFirstly, I was planning on taking subjects related to Software Engineering but mostly with regard to Cyber Security, just because I find the field interesting. Moreover, I am studying part-time and I feel that I could improve my programming skills independently. However, would I be pigeonholing myself into a Security related career with this kind of split? I wouldn't be against it, but I think I'd rather try my hand at the more general aspects of software development after the university, rather than specialising immediately. How do I 'prove' that I have actually done independent study in some more general topics? Is it just a case of building a portfolio of projects? I'd graduate with a general computer science master's if that makes a difference.\n\nSecondly, it seems as though nearly everyone in the course is choosing to specialise in Artificial Intelligence. Like, a ludicrous majority. I was originally considering taking courses related to Software Engineering and Machine Learning before changing my mind and focusing on Cyber Security, but the fact that nearly everyone is going into AI has shaken my resolve somewhat. Is Artificial Intelligence really 'the future'? Should I reconsider valuing Cyber Security over it? Why are so many people studying it?\n\nFinally, is it maybe foolish to be specialising at all, given the fact that my I have a background in a completely different field? Should I maybe just focus entirely on developing my programming skills by taking courses related to software engineering? Most of the software engineering courses on offer are undergraduate modules, which I was hoping to learn independently since, again, I'm studying part-time. Is this naive of me?\n\nThanks in advance for any replies. I understand that these questions are probably stupid, and I'm sorry for that, but I'm feeling a touch overwhelmed by the wide breadth of subjects available, so I'd be really happy if anyone could give me any advice at all. Moreover, if anyone had some general advice about switching from mathematics to CS, I'd appreciate that as well.\n\nEDIT: I should probably mention that I do have some programming experience currently (C, C++, Prolog, Python) but definitely not to the extent that a CS undergrad would have.

For example we have bootcamps similar to ones I read about in this sub, but they only started appearing a few years ago and generally have bad reputation. But we also have quite a few dev shops (including big ones and with good reputation) that run courses somewhat similar to a bootcamp but different. I'm interested if the following concept exists in the US and how common is it:\n\nA big company that instead of hiring for junior positions directly, starts a training couse. The course is widely advertized targeting equally students graduating in a couple years who don't have real experience and professionals already working for a couple years who want to switch to another technolgy stack. These courses are free of sometimes students get paid a small stipend, and o get into the program you need to compete in (often a combination of) a competitive programming contest, develop a small but preferably overengineered entry project, or go through onsite interview. The course runs for 2-4 months with 2-4 hours long classes a couple times a week in the evening so that it can be attended after university classes or after work. The company's senior devs give speeches about key parts of the technology stack used on their projects, and assign related homework. To graduate students complete some small projects in groups, and a few best graduates get hired by the teachers to their teams. Nobody guarantees students that they will be hired but anyway only people who would have no problems picking another coding job would be accepted in the program.\n\nThis is obviously different from internships (often the same companies offer internships as another option), very different from CS classes run by leading dev shops in some universities as a part of the BS or MS programs, and also quite different from US coding bootcamps that I've heard about. So I'm just curious, do you have dev shops offering something similar in the US, is it any common, and how would you call it?",

No code review? It won't happen. People will always read your code and have healthy arguments with it if they see something worth discussing. And we have a very good sprint planning and process that keeps the companies we incubate afloat with very minimal bugs - which come from parts unintentionally not covered by automated tests.\n\nCome February, I got an invite to be a temp at one of the largest companies in the world (Think of some place where everyone wants to work). It was the hardest decision of my life since my growth was starting to skyrocket with my current employer. I needed the money offered in order to fix some personal problems (came out of college with 500 pesos in my pocket, that's about 10 USD for reference) and give my family a better life.\n\nAnd so I accepted, but chose to start at around early this September, to make time and transition most of my knowledge to new hires regarding the repositories and the businesses they will be managing code for.\n\nWhen I arrived, things weren't following the company's values at all. Maybe it's because I'm just a temp along with my team mates. It was the total opposite of my growth. No tests? Dammit let's just deploy that crap. Nobody cares about that shit. No code review? Yeah don't, because the company has such high standards and they can't see what we deploy anyway - they'll just delay us. And also, fuck process - the product owner just wants to get shit done.\n\nAnd alas, there are places with nearly 1,000 to 3,000 lines of tightly coupled code. Some of which I have already started writing tests, docs, and refactors for. It looks cleaner. It works better. It's faster. However, the team thinks it's not time to make those kinds of changes because it will 'make things harder' for everyone.\n\nMy previous boss, the CTO, tells me to focus on fixing my life problem, and he has open doors to accept me back when I need to. However, I don't want to keep going to work with a broken soul and with people who have closed minds when it comes to the value of work. I love clean, testable, and working code. However it's being rejected.\n\nShould I keep staying for the money with a broken spirit, or should I go back to my previous employer where the money was OK but the growth is really strong?\n\nTLDR - Transferred to tech giant hoping for growth and financial stability, but I got into a team with a fucked up product owner and there are no tests, documentation, and code reviews",

Failure sucks, but it's a process we all have to go through in order to get better at life.\n\nHere is a short ordered list:\n\n1. A water company co-op where I was tasked with rebuilding an intranet website on my own. Let go within three weeks after failing to produce results.\n\n2. Had to build an app that took info from a DB into XML. I'll admit I got pretty far despite being out of my depth, but sadly was let go before I could even finish for taking too long (contract cut short/they didn't say why...).\n\n3. Not knowing how to Unit test or when to use OO principles in my code caused a production failure at a crappy TV service company (never learned/taught that in college).\n\n4. Not knowing how to absorb information relatively quickly enough to stay a consultant/technical trainer(also I really sucked at public speaking too). Put on a PIP and kicked out a week later.\n\n\nNow I know what you're thinking: \"Why does this guy get up a 5AM to give us a wall of text? and why am I up so early on reddit?\"\n\nI can't answer the second part, but for the first I was thinking of whether I could handle these places again if given a time machine... I know it's useless now, but I wanted to look back to see how far I came and what I would do differently possessing the current knowledge I have now (which I'll address in a different post).\n\nThese places were right to hire/sink-or-swim type of places without any guidance and I wondered what would be different if I had a different mindset. In hindsight, I would have asked for more help with these projects if it was available since I was punching above my weight class on some of these.\n\n**What are the failures of your career's past and what would you have done differently?**",

If not, would really appreciate if someone could guide me on to the right one, kind of a newbie on reddit so still figuring everything out. \n\nI am due to apply for my university degree in a week or so but I can't decide whether to do Software Development or Networking and Cybersecurity. I am a year into my 3 year degree, and have to choose my field for the next 2 years. I have done a semester (about 3 months) worth of Java and python as well as a CISCO networking course.\n\nI have been thinking about it a lot but still haven't been able to decide what to do. I enjoyed Java and really really want to learn coding but I also found it a little challenging at the same time, and it's quite obvious that it's only going to get harder over the next 2 years, which is why I'm not too sure if I should do Software Development. \n\nWhereas with networking, it was a little boring at times but a bit easier for me compared to Java. And I also love learning about Security side of the IT, although I have never ACTUALLY studied anything about cyber security, I am very interested in it. \n\nSo I'm not sure what to do, if someone could please give me some information (difficulty level, job opportunities, pay etc) about both of these areas, it would really help me decide. Maybe even some personal opinions!\n\nThanks :)\n\n\n",

I was planning to move to NYC once I graduated, but feel that it might be a waste of time, since recent grads with internships would be a better applicant than me. I was thinking about creating projects, but don't know where to start my portfolio. I program in C++ and I haven't done anything other than assignments. I was planning to learn Java, Python, and some front end programming language so that I can broaden my marketability and programming knowledge. I enjoy programming, but don't mind if I get put in other Computer Science related jobs like IT, Network Security, Database, etc. Any advice would be appreciated. ",

            "selftext": "I'm going to try to be as vague for the sake of being confidential. \n\nHere's the rundown: I recently graduated with a bachelor's of CS degree. I did fairly well in school, but I never got an internship, so I pretty much get the bottom of the barrel in terms of jobs. \n\nI recently accepted an offer that has multiple locations around the country, and they told me they would match my preference. They also told me there was a scale on which they would adjust my pay if they were to relocate me, which is very common in their company. Once I got the offer, they told me I would definitely be working in the city of my choice since they had an opening there. So keep in mind that this entire time, I was told that I would definitely be working in the city they mentioned, and that they would adjust my pay for the cost of living in a particular area if I were to be relocated.\n\nFast-forward to my training period, and I'm informed that none of that is true at all. Not only did they tell me that there was never supposed to be a guarantee of my work location, but that they would not be adjusting my salary upon relocation. Please do bare in mind that the city I agreed to work in was very affordable, yet they have offices in New York City and California where I would literally be living in poverty with the salary they agreed to pay me. HR blamed this misinformation on a breakdown of communication between them and recruitment.  \n\nIf I had any seniority or leverage in my career at all, I would have been out the door already. However, this is my first actual salary job in my field and I have very limited options. If I were to quit, I would go back to applying to jobs for God knows how long, and any opportunities that were to come my way would probably not be much better. On the other hand, is it reasonable to stay with a company a) either lied or has that bad of communication, and b) is okay with paying me so little that I wouldn't even be able to afford to live where they might send me?\n\nI would really like to stress the question about the cost of living adjustment. I was told explicitly by HR that they would not be adjusting my salary based on my work location. My parents told me that it is normal not to change the salary agreed upon in the beginning, but they should be implementing COLA in some other way. However, HR never mentioned this at all, so I'm left to assume that they're more than willing to place me in NYC at a whim with far below a reasonable salary. ",

            "selftext": "I can appreciate the value of A/B testing. Sometimes, we're making drastic changes and we want to make sure the change wouldn't hurt our metrics.\n\nHowever, in some companies, every little change needs to go through weeks of experimentation. Two companies I've worked at that were like this are Facebook and Pinterest. For smaller changes, setting up the experiment often takes longer than the implementation. Then, you need at least a few days to collect data, usually over a week. If you want to iterate, you'll have to wait another week.\n\nI think this is an inefficient use of software engineers' time. I think people want to create experiments just because they can justify their promotions more easily if there's numbers to present to their superiors. I think the industry should focus on finding a better way to promote employees, since experiments can take around half of a project's time. I agree that experiences makes the promotion process easier and more objective, but I don't think it's worth it for companies.\n\nI support creating experiments for large or risky changes. However, my teams have created experiments for tiny product change that will obviously produce no change in metrics. The product managers and engineering managers would insist on creating experiments to prove that it won't hurt metrics.\n\nCreating experiments for small and non-risky changes will present these problems:\n\n- inefficient use of engineers' time, forcing the company to hire more people\n- slower iteration time, hurting users by giving them a poorer product\n- lower metric gains. If a change would produce an increase in growth, but the experiment lasts a long time, the company loses on the gains created by the experiment while it's running.\n- causes teams to ignore potential changes that won't improve metrics. I've seen obvious product improvement ideas get ignored because the gains will be hard to measure.\n- causes teams to make changes that will improve metrics, but hurt user experience. Teams rely too much on metrics and don't see how users actually use the product. E.g. consider an app that makes you make an extra useless click to get to the page you want. You're annoyed by the extra click, but the company's metrics improved because you spent a longer time on the app.\n\nWhat do you think? Do you experience the same issue of too much experimentation or do you think the experimentation is good? How do you think the industry should address this issue? This post is focused on experimentation for product changes, what are your thoughts on experimentation for other things?",

It took me a year to find my first position as an intern because I had falsely assumed that no one would want me as an intern during my university years. I managed to turn that internship into a full time position, and really enjoyed the company I worked for, the coworkers I had, and most of the work I was doing. I also feel that I performed fairly well on the tasks I was assigned. However, after eight months of employment, I got laid off.

Not only that, but my enthusiasm to engage in personal projects and maintain my skill set is nearly at zero. I've been taking on side jobs for cash that leave me angry and exhausted at the end of the day, and I know that I need to make a change soon, whatever that may be, because the current trajectory I'm on is not working for me. While I'm pretty sure I can be successful in software development, I fucking hate looking for positions in this field, and I feel like I have no direction and it shows.

However, I've only really made offline programs that are for specific purposes (I did make one that would check Facebook for page changes or comments and alert the user). Anyway, I've mostly been focusing on C#, Java, Python, and C++. I've made lots of C# programs using windows forms, and a few Java ones. \n\nI guess what I'm wondering is, do I need to know a lot of web development stuff? Generally whenever I've tried to do web based stuff it all seems like a mess of languages and interfaces that barely work and are always changing. I've done a bit of Javascript, but it feels like a lot of people who get a CS degree go on to work on websites or web based apps that use a bunch of weird languages and stuff mixed together. I'd like to avoid purely web based stuff, but of course every App nowadays connect to the internet and I don't feel like I'm gonna be lucky enough to find an interesting job that just uses the languages mentioned above.\n\nI guess my problem is, I don't own a web domain, or a server, and I don't understand how everything works together. I've done HTML creating pages, and a little Javascript (custom word counting program) but I don't understand how everything ties together. I've used Free Code camp a bit, and I'm level 72 on the lesson \"Ditch Custom CSS for Bootstrap\", but the stuff on there doesn't really seem relevant towards what I want to do which ultimately is to become a software developer. Maybe I'm not deep enough in but HTML just seems like a UI language to me, and I'm more interested in how that works. \n\nAnyway, that's a bit of a rant. I guess my questions are, can I avoid web stuff? Should I avoid web stuff? And how can I setup an environment to learn the important stuff? So far my education has almost ignored this stuff, but I'm only just starting my third year, so that may be covered later.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.  ",

My programming and skills arent great, but I find a lot of fun tinkering around and being able to build things. I know I have a lot to learn, so I ended up taking this offer from a consultant place. The pay is crap, and im locked into a 2 year contact, but I thought the things I would learn along the way would be benificial moving forward since my skills right now I feel are not at par with people in the bigger tech places. With that in mind I signed the offer. I dont start until after I graduate this fall. Now I was recently contacted by a recruiter from a big tech company who saw my resume/linkedin and asked if I wanted to interview with them. My question is, is it rude to both parties if i move forward with the interview? Im curious about the process and was also hoping to gain some experience through it as I am hoping to apply back to them after my contract is up. I just dont want to waste anyones time. Thanks for hearing me out!\n\n\n\nTLDR: Is it ethical to continue interviewing even though you already signed an offer?\n\n\n\nEDIT: Just wanted to clarify that this is US.

On top of this, job prospects for chemistry graduates do not seem very good, with low pay, poor job security etc.\n\nJust recently, I was contacted by a professor I did research with during my undergrad. I was offered a funded masters position.\n\nThat being said, over the past few years, I have been slowly self-teaching myself programming when I have found time outside of my university-related requirements. I have enjoyed the programming I have done and have been thinking about turning down the grad school offer and trying to find a career as a developer.\n\nSo my question is this; As someone with a science degree, is it worth going back to university for a CS degree? I guess what is concerning me is this:\n\n1. I have spent most of my savings on my last degree, and while I could receive some grants, returning to university would put me in a fair bit of debt.\n\n2. Is the money and extra 4 year (I might be able to get it to 3 with transfer credits) commitment worth it for someone in my positions\n\n3. I have juggled the options of finding minimum wage part-time work to fund myself while I continue to self-teach. \n\n4. Alternatively, I've thought about going to a technical college and receiving a 2-year diploma in programming as a way to have access to networking and co-op placements. This way the tuition is much cheaper and there is a smaller time commitment, however, the education I receive will obviously be lacking compared to a CS degree.\n\nAny advice you could give would be appreciated. If you think self-teaching is the best avenue, is there a particular skill set I should be focusing on, that would provide the easiest path to landing a first job? Thanks a lot.",

I have two general questions.\n\nFirstly, how do I judge my abilities without formal education and assessment? I've been teaching myself Java intensely for just over a year, and I feel pretty confident with it. But because I'm self-taught, I don't really know how to judge my own level of experience. I can't tell whether I am as qualified as a first-year CS student, or a graduate professional. I know that many in this sub say that certifications are worthless, but is that still the case for people without a CS degree? At least a certification would quantify my level of experience in a way that I can't currently do myself. If not a certification, then what can I do to get a better understanding of my abilities in terms of careers? How can I find out whether I'm qualified to apply for an internship, a junior job, or whatever?\n\nSecondly, how do I develop the skills that a degree would give me that are beyond simply understanding a language? I get the impression that a degree involves studying multiple languages and learning about how they are combined and used in practise, but those are things that seem harder to teach myself. It's easy enough to find documentation and guides about the syntax or rules of a specific language, but what can I do to learn about the basic practical skills a degree would provide? I know that doing self-initiated projects is basically the solution, but at the moment I don't even know *what* I don't know, so I'm not sure what kind of projects I should be trying to learn about - never mind how to actually achieve them.\n\nBasically, I'm confident in my ability to use, write, and understand Java. But I'm not at all confident that this ability is all I need to get a job. So what else do I need, and how do I know when I have it?",

The position is for a software engineer in test (probably associate level).\n\nUnfortunately, I get no benefits.  No PTO, must take unpaid time off.  Limited sick days, not sure how many exactly.  Standard American holidays.  I have to sign up for health insurance through the recruitment company and while they offer 401k, I think the matching is limited.  That is pretty much it.  I might get flex hours, but definitely no work from home benefits.\n\nMy current job, I get more benefits.  Full health insurance, 401k, PTO (3-4 weeks a year), 10 days of sick, standard American holidays, stock options, flex hours, and work from home, quarterly bonus which adds up to 10% of my salary a year.\n\nWith all things considered, the pay is about the same, maybe 5 grand less per year for the contract offer, but only because I don't get stock options anymore and that PTO/sick is not included.\n\nThe problem with my current job is that it isn't software dev (not even close), it is more like glorified tech support.  I would like a path towards a CS career but I am not sure if doing software in test carries a stigma, that I am less than a standard developer.\n\nGetting pushed by recruiter to make a decision as it looks like I might get an offer going forward, what should I do?\n\nIt sucks that this is contract and not full time.  The opportunity seems nice and it is a subsidiary of a big 4, but I lose out on my benefits, and I fear I might get treated poorly, i am basically expendable at any moment they feel i am not good enough and then if I get laid off, I am SOL with no job.

            "selftext": "The long and short of it is: I cannot go another day in nursing.  I'm a 32y/o male who basically fell into nursing as a career, even though this was the last thing I ever saw myself doing.  Fast forward 10 years later and I literally can't do it anymore.  I hate my job, I hate the patients, I hate my coworkers, and I hate the person this is turning me into.  My hobbies/interests have always revolved around video games, tinkering, problem solving, etc.  The usual clich\u00e9 CS major hobbies.  I am very aware that switching careers will not be the panacea to all my problems.  I've been in a stable career for 10 years and held a job down for the last 16 years, so I know that working sucks.  Please understand that I have no rose-tinted glasses nor has the wool fallen over my eyes.  However, I do feel that there are jobs in the tech field that would be interesting to me and provide a sense of fulfillment and satisfaction.  I'm hoping that the all the amazing individuals here can provide answers to my questions, as I have a few, so let's get started!\n\n1\\.  **Degree or no degree?**\n\nI am more than willing to take whatever path is necessary.  I am financially stable enough by myself and with my fianc\u00e9's income to support a trip back into academia.  I live 10 minutes from Georgia Tech and feel that my GPA could make that a possibility.  I'm not sure how much the school name matters within the field, but I'm not opposed to going elsewhere.  I am also very driven.  I am fully capable of diving into self-learning, whatever boot-camp idea, or online course material that would facilitate my success.  I think this is the biggest question that is holding me back and I really want to feel that I've fully explored this before moving forward.  Please be blunt but withhold your bias please.\n\n2\\.  **Job Fields**\n\nI am a creative at heart.  I bring good ideas to the table, I have drive, I am very comfortable in high-stress situations, and I am comfortable being a leader.  Naturally (I could be wrong!), I feel these traits make me interested in web development, project managing, software engineering, etc.  I'm also extremely interested in programming and having the ability to make something from nothing.  I don't want to be a code monkey but I would like to be very proficient at this.  I am very open to suggestions within other fields as well so, please, feel free to suggest anything!\n\n2 er..., 3. **Math**\n\nI am very good at math.  It has always been naturally easy for me up through Calc II (yes, I know, still baby math).  But I haven't used f(x) in 10 years other than Family Guy.  I am a fast learner and I'm sure it would come back quick, but this is not my area of interest.  Thankfully, from lurking on other threads, I think most of the jobs that would require a very advanced understanding of math would be jobs that I would personally not be very interested in (i.e., academia, robotics, AI, etc.).  Obviously, if some magical dream job appeared that required advanced math, I would certainly bust my balls learning that ASAP.\n\n4\\.  **Entry Level**\n\nEntry level seems to be a touchy subject across almost all boards that I've found.  My best friend is a IT consultant at a rather large firm and would likely be able to swing an entry level position within his company when I feel prepared.  I am not banking on this, but I feel like it is there.  However, it seems that entry level positions are often caught in the Catch-22 of requiring experience.  This is a hurdle that exists across almost every profession, so this doesn't really dissuade me.  I am curious as to what are strong entry level positions that would properly position me for A. the *right* type of experience, and B. an ability to climb quickly given that I am competent at my job.\n\n5\\.  **Money**\n\nI make about $65k/yr and I work 3 twelve hour *night*-shifts per week.  Night shift fucking sucks and I'm tired of it.  I could make more if I bothered to do overtime, but I won't because I hate it so, so much.  I will currently get a 2-3% raise per year until I die with literally no option of upward movement.  I work in a busy cardiovascular-surgical ICU and am basically at the top of the top among nursing skills-wise (not gloating, there are just very few demanding specialties like this).   I want to make more money.  I want to provide for my future family and reassure my future wife that financially, we will be ok.  Tell me why it will be/won't be.\n\n6\\.  **Why do you love the tech field?**\n\nI would love to hear from some individuals that love their job, how they got there, what has kept them in the field, and what they look forward to.\n\n7\\.  **Why do you hate the tech field?**\n\nI would like to also hear from people that are like me and can't see themselves going into work another day without syringes strapped to their hands and throat punching the first person they see.  Why are you thinking of getting out of it?\n\n\n\nI'm getting old guys.  I'm not *old*, but I'm not where I thought I would be 15 years ago.  I know some of you can relate to that feeling.  I make good money, have job stability, and work in a respected profession.  But I don't want to do it anymore.  I am 99% sure that I want to do this, so help me figure out the 1%.  I am sure I will have other questions, but these are the ones that I feel are worth asking at this time.  I am also open to any questions about nursing if anyone else is having a mid-life crisis (but only if you answer my questions as well)!  It really is a great profession, just not one for me.  Thank you guys so much in advance and I hope you're having a great Wednesday.\n\nEdit:  Also, I've seen some mention across a few boards about programs such as [Oregon State Online BSCS](http://ecampus.oregonstate.edu/online-degrees/undergraduate/computer-science/) and I was wondering how these degrees are viewed within the field?  This looks to be a legitimate BS degree from a legitimate university.  Thanks for the feedback!",

            "selftext": "I am the kind of person that triple checks everything, doesn't like change, asks \"what if\" too much, and worries about every little detail. I use to start college projects early because I was afraid I'd run out of time only to finish weeks early.  I use google maps to map my route to work even after driving the route for a month, just in case I take a wrong turn. I feel like I'm one step away from rehearsing the conversation before I order a pizza. \n\nIn some ways, being so detail oriented and over-analyzing so much has helped me in my life and career. However, the only reason why I put so much time and emphasis into every little thing is only to try and reduce my anxiety. I'm a good software engineer, I get paid very very well, but I feel like software work doesn't fit my personality. I like structure. I like knowing the details and outcomes. I like repeatedly doing things until I understand it better and it becomes second nature. I love playing the guitar because I can practice a song over and over until I nail it. I like skateboarding because I'll do the same trick a dozen times until I get it perfect. I like weightlifting at the gym because I have a well-structured routine.\n\nI've worked at fast-paced, small shops with small codebases and relaxed, large megacorps with a decades old codebase. Vastly different work environment but one thing in common. Software is complex. It is extremely complex and I feel like no one really understands the \"entire picture\" or has a good grasp of it all which makes me uncomfortable. I think of software development as one person handling the steering wheel, another person controlling the throttle, another person handling the brakes, another handling the gear shifting, etc. and it's always a real struggle to do any decent driving, crashes are inevitable, and it's a bumpy road to the finish line. \n\nI've been doing this for 11 years and even my own estimates of bugfixes or features are usually off. Am I better than when I started 11 years ago? Definitely. Does 11 years of experience working at highly regarded tech companies in SF/SV/Seattle or years working on \"mission critical\" systems give me any confidence when I work on a new codebase, develop a new feature, or fix a production bug? Not really. Every task is a new challenge and I guess I don't have the energy or eagerness to tackle the \"unknown\" like I use to. \n\nThe complexity  of software coupled with my high-strung personality and changing life goals (family, settling down, less energy) makes me think its time to find a new profession. What other professions can I branch into that is less stressful? Is this the longest post on this subreddit?\n\n",

However, I also want to keep my options open and not let potential opportunities slip by. \n\nI'm especially wary because I was unable to get a return offer from where I worked this summer (big tech company in SF). Although I had sorta burnt out in the middle of the summer and didn't show enough energy by my own admission.\n\nSo coming back, I am on campus right now and attended some career fairs which led to interviews and now a couple of companies are trying to schedule onsite interviews. I'm starting my internship this coming week and am unsure of how to move forward with the interviews. \n\nSo here's my questions:\n\n1. What's the best way to interview while interning? Would my manager be okay if I took 3 or so leaves during the internship period? Would it hurt my chances of getting a return offer?\n\n2. Are my chances of getting a return offer lower as a fall intern than as a summer intern?\n\n3. Would the spring recruiting season (for full time jobs) be significantly smaller than the fall season? Or can I take it easy with interviewing right now and start again in the spring if I don't get a return offer?\n\nThanks for reading all that and for any advice you all might have! ",

I ignored all this considering Im not wanting to be a big 4 $250k earner. \n\nNow a family friend, who works a normal CS job in Quality Assurance, just told me that Im in a field with constant learning. He scared me about how a family life and job life would be difficult to balance. I kinda knew I had to keep up with technology, but I never expected it to be this intense. I realize I'll have to learn newer frameworks and libraries and possibly different languages across the job, but I thought it was supposed to be during work hours. I don't know how Ill be tested and how comfortable Ill be with a new language/framework/library. \n\nCan anyone calm me down how it really works?\nThanks",

I have been with the company for over 5 years and have always received exemplary reviews. I'm an EE and started in QE at the company. I bolstered up my programming skills on my own time and ended up moving to a SWE position. I've been in this position for around 4 years now.

            "selftext": "Hi guys, hope you are having a splendid day. I am a contractor as a Software Technician so I do absolutely no coding. \n\nI love programming and would have hoped it turned out to be my career. After several attempts at applying to companies, it appears I am not getting very far. \n\nThe past few weeks have been me learning web development as this is where the jobs, specifically entry Level, seem to be. Although I have had fun learning it, I feel like something is missing. Everything just seems pretty boilerplate. Which isn't bad, but that leads me to my next paragraph.\n\nI have an oculus rift and thoroughly enjoy it. I should also mention my deep love for video games. Although I don't play them much anymore, simply because there is not much free time anymore, I still have a passion for making them. See, I spent many evenings in college just making video games. Even got one completed enough to have been able to put it onto the google play store and Apple App Store. I messed around with so many different game development ideas and processes. Even delved into the Google VR SDK. This is where it all starts to come together. Even when I was making non-VR games and showing them to friends, I was able to see the joy in their faces, as many of them were programmers so they understood the work that went into them. Then I went into making GOOGLE VR apps I was able to absolutely wow them with how spectacular VR is. \n\nWhich now brings me to last night. I introduced my friend to his first PC VR experience. Of course, it was an awesome experience seeing someone experience current VR to its fullest (current) potential.\n\nI've realized what I love about Programming most is: being able to innovate the world. It sounds cheesy I know, but in a lot of ways it's kind of like how Steve jobs felt (and Bill Gates, not to discriminate). What I mean is, I watched Steve jobs' unveiling of the iPhone due to recent events making me watch it. And you could tell the passion that he had for innovation. When he revealed that the 3 new products were all actually 1...was just a breathtaking experience. He reinvented the mobile phone market. Now sure, I'm not going to be that crazy. But to be able to make a great VR  game and make friends or even the general populace play them would be an amazing feeling. Just being able to create a magical experience in VR is something else. \n\nI guess I'm not looking for an answer. Just maybe some insight into choosing to build VR apps compared to building websites. \n\nThanks!",

It's been 2 months since I decided to do this (took awhile to get going with other companies, but I have an offer now), and I've only been working at the company for 4.5 months.\n\nFor some context, I moved from working on full-stack user-facing applications at my last few companies to working on medical devices. It was a pretty big change, but I thought I might enjoy it. My manager, when presenting his offer, made it clear that he was aware this was a big change for me and wanted me to make sure that I knew what I was doing. I thought I did, so I accepted it.\n\nAfter a few weeks in, aside from the fact that the technology stack and development process was not what I thought it would be (I now realize that full-stack is the right place for me), I realized I was miserable. I just figured it was because I hadn't completely ramped up yet, but it just kept getting worse and worse. Eventually, I said enough was enough, and decided to leave. I tried to get back with my old company, but they went through a merger that came with a hiring freeze, so after a month of waiting for that I realized that it might be awhile and started looking elsewhere.\n\nI just got an offer from a company that would be perfect for me, and I'm already planning on accepting it (I need to give a courtesy to some other companies first, so I'm waiting on that), and now I'm ready to have that conversation with my manager.\n\nGiven this context, and the fact that I'm coming back from two last-minute PTO days so I could do interviews, I'm not expecting this conversation to go well. Aside from the fact that:\n\n- He will be frustrated that he warned me about this before I started and I didn't heed his warning.\n- I haven't spoken to him once about my feelings.\n- I took 2 days off without notice.\n\nI have **absolutely** no idea what to tell him about why I don't like working there. I'm going to say \"it's a bad culture fit\" which is true, but he's going to want specifics. As far as I can tell, these are the reasons I can think of:\n\n- The technology doesn't interest me\n- I don't care about the product\n- There's no chemistry with the team\n- Development is too slow (regulations)\n- Culture is too competitive\n- I'm... just miserable\n\nI don't feel like that's enough. Moreover, he's going to ask what can be done to fix those things, and I **just want to leave**. I don't want to have this drawn out conversation with him. This is my ideal case:\n\n- Me: \"Hi <manager>, I'd like to submit my two week's notice.\"\n- Manager: \"Oh, I'm really sorry to hear that. Actually, why don't we just let you go today.\"\n- Me: \"Fantastic! See you around.\"\n\nObviously it's not going to go that way, but how can I get it to go as smoothly as possible, and with as little conflict as possible?",

            "selftext": "Hi everyone, \n\nI\u2019ve always lurked around around here for about a year but this will be my first post. I\u2019m kinda at a crossroads. I\u2019m a senior currently applying to college and I\u2019m not sure what I want to do. I\u2019ve narrowed it down to two majors CS and Biology (pre-med). Both my parents are dentists and my older brother is currently at their alma mater applying for dental school. I\u2019ve been interested in computer science since 8th grade but when contrasting it with my parents job I want to be sure in the major that I choose. One thing I love about my parents job is that they\u2019re self-employed. They have the freedom to hire who they want, schedule who they want, and work when they want. I\u2019ve read about some of the horrors and frustrations of working in Corporate America and other stuff that I just wouldn\u2019t have to deal with being a practicing doctor. On top of that, my parents make a fair amount of money over that of a code monkey and with their help, connections, and money following in their footsteps wouldn\u2019t be too hard. Currently, I\u2019m applying to University of Georgia, Georgia Tech, Stanford, University of Kentucky (parent\u2019s alma mater), and MiT. I\u2019m really scared I\u2019ll end up going to a stem focused school and hate CS. Or worse, finish school and hate the industry. That\u2019s why a school like Stanford would be ideal with strong programs in both Bio and CS. Overall, I just want to make sure I\u2019m making the right choice. To the people in the industry, how would you describe the industry/work schedule/environment? Do you ever get frustrated? Personally, I\u2019m not the best a dancing to someone else\u2019s drum and don\u2019t know if I could handle working in Corporate America. Really, I just need someone to convince me.\n\n*Forgot to mention I took AP CS and enjoyed it but I\u2019m not sure if that really gave a snapshot of what people in the industry actually do.\n\nTL;DR Convince me why I would choose CS or Bio (pre-med)\n",

I speak 3 languages and I really like programming. I have been programming for a while now, but was never able to find a job with it. I started with Python and really liked it, but then got told that in order to be a software developer I need to know algorithms and data structures. I took the advice and followed the algorithms course offered by MIT, got the book Introduction to Algorithms and then I started solving problems on HackerRank, here is my profile : https://www.hackerrank.com/suburb4nfilth . All of my projects are on Github : https://github.com/SuburbanFilth\n\n1. Am I doing this whole thing wrong ? \n2.

            "selftext": "Some backstory: I graduated with a bachelors degree in CS 2 years ago from UCLA. I've always enjoyed working with computers in my spare time. Ever since I was 15 I've had a small homelab and I have been very interested in IT infrastructure.\n\nI started my career towards software engineering my junior year of college when I got a software engineering internship offer at a Big N company in the SF Bay Area. To be honest, I still do this day do not know why they gave me the offer. I didn't do well in the technical interview at all. However, they thought I performed well during the 3 month internship and gave me an offer letter to return the next year after I graduated from college.\n\nI worked at this Big N company for just over a year until I was fired. It was extremely clear I was not a good programmer at this point and this is why I was fired. I wrote poor code. Simple as that. I wasn't even mad honestly because it was totally understandable that I was sacked. I also just did not enjoy writing software very much. It wasn't for me.\n\nA few months after I was fired I got a job as a software engineer for a very large utilities company. At this point I needed money so even though I didn't like programming I just took the first job that accepted me. I've now been working here for 9 months and I hate it just as much as my last job. I just cannot stand writing software. I hate working with these shitty frameworks and having to read tons of old code just to get a grasp of what to do. It isn't for me. Plus I am not good at it.\n\nAt this point I just want to quit and move back in with my parents while I find a different career path. I would pretty much do anything else if it meant I could keep my current salary of $97k/year. I find a lot of things really interesting like IaaS or even working at a tech support help desk or becoming a sys admin. However I have no idea if I can even branch into these things or even if it is too late. I don't know what I should do and it is driving me insane.",

But I'm concerned that most of the coursework, especially in the first two years, is redundant.\n\nI'm also not quite sure what I would do for work. Most undergrads work internships during the summers. But I cannot imagine working as an intern, nor anyone hiring me as an intern. (I have mentored summer interns in the past)\n\nSo has anyone actually done this? What was it like?",

I can barely pay attention in class and dread attempting any homeworks.\n\nMath has always been my best subject and I enjoyed my computer science classes in highschool so I think computer science is the right choice for me.\n\nHowever I am surrounded by people who seem to have a much stronger passion for CS than I do and it makes me doubt if CS is what I should be majoring in. \n\nTL;DR - I'm a college student that lost interest in learning.\n\nQuestions: \nHas your passion/drive for CS ever been low? \n\nHow did you overcome this and find joy again in this field?\n\nAre you happier having a job than when you were in college?(if attended)",

            "selftext": "Update: thanks for all the encouragement and advice. I don't have the time to respond to all the PMs I got, but thanks for lending out a hand to help. I talked with a senior trader today and he basically gave me a full timeline of what I can expect. Apparently, what I'm experiencing right now is all part of training, and competitors more or less do it in some way. He didn't really make me feel too positive about the future. I'll stick around until I get my bonus, then I'm packing my bags for (hopefully) the Bay Area. I'm banking on the fact that they won't enforce the training contract, but as per a few people's suggestions, I'll also be actively looking for a safe way out.\n\nHi, I\u2019m a 22 y/o graduate. My first day of work was 2 months ago, and my last might be within the next week.\n\nI work at a tech-first trading firm as a junior trader. The name\u2019s a bit misleading though, since that\u2019s not really what I\u2019ve been doing. The company is big and very established in the quantitative finance space, but it\u2019s not a name I would expect anyone outside the industry to recognize.\n\nI joined this firm because I imagined it to be fun, challenging, and more dynamic than software engineering at a typical tech firm, among other reasons. For the past two months I\u2019ve just been stressed, depressed, and I haven\u2019t had any time at all for friends. My apartment is a bed and two bar stools. There really hasn\u2019t been much time for anything outside of work.\n\nSo far I\u2019ve been averaging 12 hours a day, and a half-Saturday, for a 70 hour work week. The first two weeks I met a lot of new hires. Right now, only about 80% of them are left. The rest were fired. These weren\u2019t untalented people either. Most were from Ivies or MIT. One guy was fired because he needed to run some errands in the middle of the work day. He gave a notice to his team beforehand but was late to a meeting. He was fired on the spot, right in front of the rest of us. The meeting wasn\u2019t even important.\n\nWhen not coding, we\u2019re in the classroom. It\u2019s not a typical class though, and we learned quickly that we had to be competitive even against each other. I found out the senior employees made \u201cbets\u201d on those who would come out on top, and those who will be chopped. Apparently it\u2019s a firm tradition. If we get fired within the first year \u2014 or leave for any reason \u2014 we have to pay back the cost of training. The number is astronomical. It\u2019s basically a year\u2019s salary up to the point you left.\n\nTheir hiring logic is disgusting as well. They overhire because they expect only a certain percentage of us will remain after a few months. Apparently this is fine because it\u2019s easy for them to pick up another Harvard douche and have him/her do what the previous person could not do. \n\nMistakes are not easily forgiven. What I\u2019ve seen, they stick for the rest of your short career at the firm.  Yesterday I was playing around with some data, thinking I could throw in a quick model and strategy and test a trade. I forgot I was using the same testing infrastructure that some of the traders were running their models on for their live trading (there are many machines we can ssh into, and with so many windows open it\u2019s easy for a newbie like me to lose track of which one I\u2019m on). I had written my code to take up all cores on the machine and left it in the background. A few minutes later a few of the traders were screaming bloody mary because their sheets had frozen. I was yelled at but wasn\u2019t fired. In my head I\u2019m thinking that if a machine is so important to someone\u2019s trading activity, it should either have restricted access, or limits should be placed on the resources it can allocate to each user. \n\nCall me insane for sticking it out until now, but I guess I have a few reasons. The first is the upside. The meritocratic structure rewards high-performers extremely well. There are 24-29 year olds at this firm who made close to or more than a million last year. However, given how I think I\u2019m doing so far, there\u2019s close to a 0% chance I\u2019m ending up in their position in 2-7 years. The second is that it looks bad to leave a company in such a short time. The amount of time I spend on work or thinking about work also prohibits me from interviewing at other places.\n\nAt this point I\u2019ve already forgotten why I\u2019ve typed all this. It\u2019d be nice to get some recommendations on what I could do. I think I would be a lot happier right now if I left and went into a standard software engineering job. I don\u2019t know if anyone\u2019s been in a similar situation, but I\u2019m open to hearing any stories.",

Honestly, I didn't have much of a choice: either be an RA and get paid/health insurance, or be unemployed and go further into debt. \n\nThe research is about using learning strategies to optimize a system which simulates some sort of \"micro-economy\". The program is incredibly complex and I'm super overwhelmed, I don't even know where to begin to understand this program(s). The documentation is also complex, each article links me to several other articles to read and the cycle continues. I'm really stressed, every week at the group meetings the PI asks me if I've made any progress and I really don't know how to answer, like \"No, I'm fucking lost!\" I have a little bit of help from another grad student but English is not his first language so there are communication issues. I don't know what to do. \n\nI thought, fuck it, I'll just quit and go into more debt I suppose.

So in the past 3 months, I've been very busy, working nights (we also work with devs in India) and weekends. We went through layoffs earlier this year (and some people left, knowing that the situation was getting worse), so the amount of work has been piling high. Almost everyone in our site is putting in crazy hours to keep up. The current project is so mismanaged that, at this point, we're just giving patchwork to the customer.\n\nNow, I've had thoughts about leaving my division for a while now, even before the layoffs. I should have started applying then, but I never thought it would get this bad that I can't find time to find another job. I legitimately had no clue what the effects of the layoffs would be like. Definitely learned my lesson.\n\nSince I'm the most junior, I'm stuck with all these responsibilities that other devs don't have the time to do, do some support, and on top of that I have to be working on assigned features. I've had to ask my manager to push these features because I don't think I have the capacity, but customers are also pushing back. I feel so burnt out and I feel like I need a year's worth of sleep.\n\nHow can I cope with this situation, when I've already pushed back on a lot of things? Is there a way for me to be looking for jobs right now? Or do I just have to hunker down and deal with this until things get better? In your experience, will things get better?",

I spoke with my manager about a month ago, and he made it pretty clear that they wanted to being me on full time, but doesn't think they will be able to make me a hard offer soon, because of a large merger and some HR stuff. My manager also said if I get any other offers to let him know and he'll see if he can \"incentivise me to hold out\" until they put together an offer. \n\nI just interviewed at another great local company last week, and received an offer today from them, and it's a little bit lower salary than the number my manager threw out, but still a great offer nonetheless.\n\nMy question is, how do I bring this up?

The problem is that they've given me like two weeks to decide (I already asked for an offer extension deadline and was declined this option).\n\nI am aware of some of the expected consequences for reneging on an offer:\n- You won't likely ever be able to work at that company again\n- Might reflect negatively on you\n\nNeither of these really concern me. I'm more worried if there's a chance that whatever future company I might potentially renege the offer in favor of would be able to find out that I had reneged an earlier offer? Like I mentioned above, I did intern there and it is on my resume, so I'm worried that if/when they call that company to verify my employment, etc. that it could somehow come up. **Basically: what avenues would a company realistically pursue to fuck me over if I renege?**\n\nSide question: It also seems like once you've accepted an offer, leveraging that offer in the future during interviews would not be a smart idea, i.e., \"I received X amount of money from <company I might renege offer from>\".

I'm a bit concerned about the non-compete clause, however, as it seems overly restrictive.\n\nIn particular, as per my best legalese translation, the clause prevents me from being employed by or consulting for any business that's a 'partner, customer, client, or account of Company' for 6 months after terminating employment. That means I couldn't work for any of their customers (there are quite a few, and it's impossible to tell who they are) after leaving *which seems absurd*.\n\nIt also says I can't employee any employee of Company during this same period. Aka, I can't recruit my friends/colleagues for a new business venture or something if I have a start-up that gets traction. Not really a deal-breaker, but also seems overly restrictive.\n\nThe other non-compete items seem fair to me, but those two are worrying, particularly the former. Would it be fair for me to bring this up to the company and tell them that they need to change those terms?\n\nMainly, I just want the 6 month non-compete to only include competing companies in the marketing SaaS space. Restricting me from being employeed by a customer or client of the Company is not something I'm really comfortable agreeing to.\n\nFor context, this will be my first professional job. It's part-time, hourly, with no benefits, but the rate is fair. I like the company and would like to work with them, but this non-compete things is bothering me.",

Unless it's an established company you already know well, be careful with the ratings. One thing I've found occasionally useful is the rating distribution/trend feature that Glassdoor provides. Here is an example of a very suspicious rating graph: \n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/quFgZ\n\nNotice the sudden spike in ratings after 4/2017. And notice how the distribution is almost bi-modal in nature, with many 5 star ratings and even more 2 star ratings. To me this suggests that the company used 5 star ratings to boost their overall numbers. \n\nOn the flip side, here is the rating distribution for a company that I've personally worked at. I more or less agree with its given rating and would consider this to be much more \"normal.\"\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/JTIHh\n\nThe rating trend is a lot more stable and ratings follow a typical skewed distribution instead of bi-modal. I've noticed that most of the established companies also show similar trends.\n\nJust something to be wary of when you're looking into a company that you don't know much about. \n\n",

However, I wish to extend my deadline again because I want to apply & interview with other companies. I asked my recruiter if I can do this, and she asked how much time I'm hoping to have, what I'm trying to do with the (hypothetical) extra time, and what's missing from my offer that's making me hesitate.\n\nHow should I respond? The company does not negotiate new grad offers, and I've heard that in a negotiation you should never make the first offer. I have not gotten any other offers although I'm in the midst of a few interviews. I'm also hesitant to say that I'm applying to other companies, for fear that my recruiter won't extend my deadline based on that alone. ",

For context, I'm currently working and living in the south of the UK, but I have found myself disengaged with my current company as up until recently I was not working in a proper software engineering role becoming deskilled. They have moved me into a software department but there are issues with code ownership and they don't make use of modern practices. \n\nA good friend of mine knew I was becoming unhappy and referred me at his company's London office, who are establishing themselves as an amazing company to work for, primarily based in the US, and are the sort of company to have table tennis in the next room and beers in the fridge (I don't want to say who as I know they recruit on Reddit too). Essentially, everything my current company is not. \n\nAfter successfully passing the initial interview stage, I was given a coding challenge to complete. It was an interesting challenge but I must admit I didn't understand why the challenge focussed around a particular implementation, and after checking posts here on Reddit, stack overflow, and glass door it appeared I wasn't alone. That's not the reason I'm posting though, obviously I didn't complete the challenge to their expectation, but have been told to reapply in 6 months with topics to improve on. \n\nSo looking ahead and preparing for the next time or even for other interviews, I have to ask myself if I'm fully prepared for this type of interview? I've done some searching and found \"Cracking the coding interview\" which seems to be a good resource. Can anyone who has been in a similar situation recommend resources to learn from to improve as a software engineer?\n\n**tl;dr I'm a young software engineer working at a legacy company who needs experience in modern practices to find a new job, how can I improve?**",

Well, now I am one, and it seems like I'm learning a lot more useful information much more quickly on my own than I am through the master's, and it's a hell of a lot cheaper.

Been doing some soul searching and I figured it could be useful to hear the stories of others. \n\nSo for full time employees working steady jobs when did you know it was time to move on from a job? Was it a big change at the company or a bunch of minor things that built up? Was it just better pay or a more interesting product? Did you just want to go? Would you think that your reasons for leaving were reasonable if you had to defend them to others? Did you just drop the job and look for a new one or did you sort of discretely look for a new one while working at your old gig? Have you heard other programmers's reasons for bailing and think it was dumb?\n\n",

I didn't get very far. \n\nI couldn't find information about who I'd be working with, how we'd be working together, or what my actual day-to-day grind would look like. As a result, I couldn't bring myself to write cover letters, do phone screens, complete take-home challenges, or prepare for full-day onsite interviews. I needed to what I was applying for! \n\nSo, I built Key Values (https://www.keyvalues.io) instead.\n\nMy hope with Key Values is to help engineers like me find teams that share their values. I worked closely with CTOs, engineering managers, engineers, and the occasional technical recruiter to put these profiles together so that people could learn more about who/what they're applying to.\n\nI created a preset list of of values that engineering teams could choose from. They each self-selected the 8 that best describe their engineering team's values and culture, and then do their best to \"prove it\" in their profile. \n\nI'm working on adding more teams. As I do, I wonder how many of you would find this useful during your next job search. \n\nThanks in advance! Lynne (@lynnetye)",

The responsibilities seem like something I would enjoy, and it's only supposed to be a part time responsibility while you continue to do normal dev work. My concern is that if I begin training for this, and then find that it's more of a full time commitment, it may make me less hireable as a dev in the future. I'm not far enough into my career (only a little over a year) to be at a point where I'm ok with transitioning to a less code focused career, so I don't want to be able to only apply for positions as a full time agile coach in the future. But I also think having this experience (if I can continue learning as a developer) would look great on my resume. I also don't know the prospects of agile coach as a career. Are jobs as readily available? Is the market flooded? What happens if agile goes the way of waterfall? \n\nAny thoughts would be appreciated!    \n",

In general I can see a large gap between me and some really smart people in the my CS student body. This question is hard to answer but what can I do to reach that kind of level? I know there's many answers to this like side projects and learning outside of classes, but i don't know where to start. I really want to do better than I am but don't know where to find any material to learn more. Thanks for any advice at all! Any recommendations are welcome.",

But I have no way of ascertaining value.\n\nThey won't tell me strike price, number of shares outstanding, etc.\nI understand the whole idea that options are to be thought of as a lottery ticket. \n\nBut I'm in a real conundrum because I have a competing job offer at a large, public company.\n\nThe other offer has me at a higher title (promotion), a significant salary increase, annual bonus, hefty signing and relo bonuses, etc.\nSo, it's 1) market-rate base + options (but lower than market total comp), or 2) above market rate base and total comp and promotion but no equity.\n\nI'm 28 and inclined to take the large company employer, but I do think that the work at the startup is more interesting and aligned with my personal interests. It's arguably in a nicer city too, but with a significantly higher COL.\n\nI think the company has a decent chance of getting acquired, but slim to none of going public. It's also profitable, so I think the odds of later rounds are lower. The company also flies under the radar in regards to funding somewhat because I only see the initial series A they raised several years ago online. And FWIW, it's backed by two very prestigious / prominent PE and VC firms.\n\nI guess my real set of questions are: how do I back into the value of my options? What are some questions I can ask them? Is it reasonable to ask what their investors' liquidation preferences are? What are questions I can ask them that will raise red flags if they don't disclose any answers to?\n\nSomething to note: the HR recruiter at the startup told me that the strike price would be around $X, but when I spoke to their CFO, he told me separately that they would not be able to disclose strike price. I didn't bring up the fact that the recruiter told me it was around $X because she was in the conversation and I didn't want to get her in trouble if she wasn't supposed to tell me that.\n\nBut yeah.

The ERP we use is very antiquated and hard to keep data clean in. I've tried to bring in Power BI to get some better reporting, but for some reason management is against using it. They prefer the terrible built in analytics package, which is very inefficient and all does through SQL queries.\n\nIs there anything I can do to better prepare myself for a data role at another company? Should I just start applying for jobs and hope for the best if I can get in somewhere else? I just feel unprepared for a \"real\" data analyst job.\n",

Not hating it, just not my cup of tea.\n\nI don't know how far away this transition is (it's a large company, so nothing happens fast), and there are other organizations inside of the company that don't use javascript, but they are mostly focused on legacy (think 20+ years) C++, and i've done enough of that to not really want to go back.

Is it better to transition sooner rather than later, given i'm still \"fresh\" out of college? (e.g. under 3 years). \n\nI'm not the kind of person who likes the idea of bouncing around companies, and would really prefer to find a place that i'd be comfortable staying at for years, and becoming a senior individual in that company, and a go to subject matter expert kind of person.

            "selftext": "Hey\n\nI've been working at a company since I graduated last summer.  Recently, I began working more closely with one of my seniors who's about 10 years older and has a lot of experience.  He has a lot of domain knowledge and is an okay programmer, but he's a bit hard to work with.\n\nWhenever we pair program I run in to a lot of issues.  If he's the one typing, he doesn't really listen to what I'm saying, as if he didn't even hear it.  He starts checking his email and can get sidetracked for like 10-30 minutes (after saying \"just give me one second to reply to this\"). I do have ways to deal with this, but it's a good indicator of what I'm trying to get at.\n\nIf I'm the one typing, he seems to get very bored very quickly until I finally say \"Why don't I just look at this for a while and let you know what happens\".  For the most part I just let him type as we've been slightly more successful.\n\nWhenever we run in to issues, he's very quick to frustration.  I'm 10 years his junior, but I feel very awkward when it comes to me trying to carefully think something out and he just keeps shouting \"No, it doesn't make sense! I just fixed this, it should just work!\".  I think this is mostly because he gets stressed over work very easily, and he quickly spirals out of control.  This of course tends to stress me out, as when I'm trying to think about how to solve a problem the last thing I want is someone giving up instantly and telling me how everything he does should 'just work'.\n\nThe last big thing that bothers me that I'd like to bring up is the fact that he's very averse to change.  For example, he and our team has been using SVN for their whole careers.  Our program decided it would be a good idea to try Git as it's obviously grown in popularity and why not try it.  As one of the only people who has experience with Git, I've been tasked with kind of helping everyone transition.  For the most part it's been fairly smooth, and although I run in to some resistance when trying to share my opinion on how to use Git my team has been fairly open to trying it.  \n\nThe only exception is the coworker I've been speaking about.  He is very averse to switching, and constantly points out the \"problems\" git has (i.e. the things he doesn't understand and wont take time to understand, or at least ask me questions about).  He gets very upset and flustered when things don't just 'work'.  When I try to explain the logic behind git, he doesn't really try to listen and just chooses to stay angry and confused.  I know learning new things can be hard and I want to be a resource on how to use Git, but feel he doesn't really give me the chance.\n\nAs a junior I think it can be a valuable experience to have these kinds of interactions with coworkers.  However, I've been doing this for a while now and felt I have learned to deal with it as best I can.  I don't know what I am supposed to do in this situation, but to start off I do have a few questions:\n\n1)  I know this is obviously my point of view, and I encourage you to point out things I could do better (or ask for clarification on how I deal with certain things). \n\n2)  Am I being unfair by letting it bother me this much?  I know everyone has different tolerances for stress, and my perception is his is just exceptionally low.  I don't want to fault him for that, **but as a professional I feel this impacts my work on a daily basis which is my biggest concern.**\n\n3) What would you do in this situation?\n\nFor reference (and to make sure I'm not just crazy), I've pair programmed with everyone else on my team and it goes much better.  We're usually able to logically solve a problem step by step without getting totally flustered.  I feel this gives me at least some reference for what I should expect from a coworker/professional SDE.\n\n**TL;DR** coworker quick to anger when solving problems, what do?",

Went to cc for 1 year, have 1 more year left before I can transfer out and call myself a cs major at a 4 year university. The 4 year University near me has allowed me to take cs classes (started 1 term ago, will go for all 3 terms this year) as an un admitted student, so by the time I am an admitted student I will be a senior with 1 year left in cs. All courses Ive taken are graded, registrars office will tell employers I am enrolled, but not in a degree program. What are my options here? I will have all of the necessary knowledge, well above a 3.0 (on the current 4 year university transcript), all assignments up on github, plus a few ongoing side projects. What would be your best suggestion here? Is it unlikely that anyone will take me as an intern? Am I able to put pursuing bs in cs on resume even though I will not be enrolled in the cs program until after the internship starts? Are there companies or small startups that do not require University enrollment? Purely in search of internship experience to avoid being left behind. \n",

I started studying computer science when I was 26, and recently graduated with a 1st class masters degree in Computer Science. \n\nWhen I started studying, I enjoyed working on embedded projects and small games and finished my studies with a machine learning oriented final year project. Somewhere along the way I got sucked into web app development work, certainly there is a huge demand for people who can help startups implement their products as web apps. I am now working full time as a full stack developer, maintaining and adding features to a small startup's python web application. \n\nI feel like the work I'm doing has little to do with the science part of computer science. It's mostly fighting with the technical debt of a badly thought out web app, hacking things together and creating more technical debt. The money is good, and the people are nice, but the work feels mundane and repetitive and not very technically challenging or creative. I definitely miss the low level algorithmic challenges. And as nice as the people are, the office is very quiet and people rarely speak to each other. There is very little collaborative problem solving.\n\nI've been working on some personal projects thinking I'll brush up on some C++ skills, maybe build a small portfolio of game/real time rendering projects before and after work with the aim of finding a position I\u2019m more passionate about but the hours are killing me. \n\nI want to leave my current position, spend a few weeks brushing up on my C++, doing a freelance embedded project I've been offered and then applying for new jobs in native development, either games/rendering, embedded systems, or basically anything that involves using some algorithmic skill (not that web apps don\u2019t require skill, it\u2019s just the product I\u2019m working on is very boring).\n\nDoes it look bad to apply for jobs if you're not currently employed? I'm thinking it would be better to show up to an interview fresh and excited from doing engaging work than burnt out from trying to do work and personal/portfolio projects at the same time?",

They schedule an interview with me the the next Monday and I talk to this guy. I am honest with him and say I read about big data but have not worked with it, when he asked me questions about it. He seemed to be fine. He asked about how I got into development and  I gave him my story. He asked me if I was interested in Hadoop or backend in general I said yes but I prefer the front end I am open to try anything. \n\nThen he went on to how past candidates burnt out after a few weeks \"if your're going to work for 16 hours you might as well do something you enjoy, or atleast tolerate.\"  I was like your right. And then he went on a rant about \n backend vs frontend and he kept on saying 16 hours this, 16 hours that, I am a workaholic, I had my own startup. Then I asked him, \"are people really working 16 hours at your company?\" and he said \"well, no you work 8 but since the field moves so fast you have to put in time after work to learn\" . Okay I understand, I am self taught and i put in 3-4 hours of work after my unrelated job so I can understand. But still that is 11-12 hours not 16 how can one possibly work 16???? That is red flag 1. \n\nred flag 2, he sends me a coding tutorial in hadoop and he \"Expects me to have it turned in by 9am\". Well man, you're not by boss yet, today is my birthday and I am not planning to do a whole lot of code tonight.

            "selftext": "Hi everyone,  \n  \nI'm in a very tough situation right now. I failed out of my top tier Master's program a few months ago due to failing to meet the GPA requirements of the core courses (I was very close). I plan to apply again next year so I can go back and finish it (part time/night courses) and my advisor told me that my credits would transfer. To actually get accepted back; I'd have to show vast improvement and also a job, etc.\n\nI've been trying to get a job as a junior developer/engineer now for 2 months and haven't received ONE call regarding my resume. I only get occasional calls from really shady recruiters who don't even know my skills and recommend me for Senior roles. They also always fail to tell me what company or where their clients are located. I've never really had an internship as they employers at career fairs always told me I didn't have enough experience when I was in college.  \n\nI've recently fixed up my resume with a Latex template and switched some wording and still no calls.  \nHere's a link to the resume: https://imgur.com/a/Oq2qF\n   \nI'm trying to now work and actually complete my projects, uploading some of the projects and coursework to GitHub and I've bought/downloaded some courses to take in Android, Swift, etc. Would I really only be able to get a call back once I have a nice portfolio and all my projects finished? I also have to study my ass off to actually do well on the whiteboard interviews but I can't even get one yet!\n\nWhat do you guys think my best course of action would be? Is it as simple as just working on my projects and buffing my portfolio, then study for the interviews and then apply? Then after I have a job; apply to be reinstated in my Master's program and complete my 4-5 courses left? I'm getting a little discouraged that I can't even get a call back; frankly I didn't get many call backs for internship applications while I was enrolled. I'm also a little worried on how long it would take until I get that job since I don't have the luxury of waiting many more months until I can get one. \n\nHope some of you can help me out, thanks :)\n\nEDIT: I'd like to add that the \"Junior Developer\" on the resume was a volunteer role (unpaid) that started in the summer and was on average a 30 hour per week job.

I want to get a career in game dev or simulation, and I'm starting to learn the basics. However, every time I sit down to do it, I can't help but think of all the people that started doing this when they were 12, and how far \"behind\" I am relative to them. It's quite disheartening to look up a Youtube tutorial, only to hear that the kid giving it hasn't gone through puberty yet.\n\nNow, people on this sub may discourage me from game dev, and maybe I discover myself that game dev is really as bad as people say, but then I'm back at square one. I have to learn something completely different, like web dev, which is a whole different skillset. Then, if I were to learn that, I would be even older, and again I'd think of all the people that started this when they were 12.\n\nTo me, it almost feels like you should've known what you wanted while you were starting high school, and stuck with it. Otherwise, you're infinitely behind the people that didn't, as your portfolio isn't nearly as extensive.\n\nI know that in practice though, this field is constantly changing, and you always need to learn new things. What comes with that is that I'm frequently going to be \"behind\" other people. My main question is: **How do you deal with this?** Unfortunately, right now, it seems like one of these will eventually happen:\n\n* a) I'll get depressed and never bother to learn/do what I want to. \n* b) I'll feel like I need to \"catch up\" and inevitably burn out as I feel guilty any time I'm not working.\n* c) I'll do what I need to, but always have an inferiority complex regardless because other people my age will have years of experience on me.\n\nI think I'm going to to take a year off from school to learn what I want, and build relevant projects, but I don't just want to fall into a pit of depression during that time. \n\n**All that being said, I'm fully aware that there are people that are way older than I am, that go through career changes, etc. that must have dealt with the same feelings that I did. I do not mean for this post to be depressing to you guys.** Ultimately, I know these feelings are irrational and that I'm still young, but I'm still curious about the best ways to go about coping with them.",

I want to work in tech consulting/finance and with startups (plan to start my own one day). I think taking a CS degree can help me learn more to relate to these fields. I've loved tech since I was a kid - I've consulted many tech and VR startups during my internships, built my own PC, and I want to learn how to code and gain more technical skills but never got the chance because I went to a specialized business school.\n\nI'm thinking about going back to school and getting another degree in CS, whether it be another bachelors or a masters but I'm not sure what would suit my needs/I'm not sure if I fulfill the requirements for a masters. I had a mediocre GPA in college, but my test scores for college entrance were quite high, if that is still a factor here. I've learned R and Excel during my Quantitative Math classes and have taken 3 levels of those classes (learned Minitab, R, StatTools, Tableau). I'm not sure if these courses would be enough to qualify towards a masters.\n\nIn terms of a bachelors, I would probably go to my local state college in NJ (Rutgers) or look around for another state school instead of a small localized school again. If I go the bachelors route, I'm assuming that I don't have to complete 4 years again, since I have liberal arts/math requirements from my previous degree and it would only be 2 years? \n\nI'm not quite sure how this works, any guidance would be appreciated!",

No matter how many other companies I'm applying to at the time, a company who couldn't send a \"nay\" email is persona non grata to me. I was just curious if there's any actual merit to this. Is this a yellow/red flag for the company, or am I just jumping to conclusions? I mean, post-interview silence could just mean the HR person forgot to send an email or a call.\n\nThere are a couple assumptions here. One, that I didn't bomb the interview terribly, and two, that there is a decent amount of time (6 months or more) in between the interview where I got ghosted afterwards and thoughts of re-application.\n\nThis is not a \"serious\" question by any means; just a curiosity thing.

I felt that it would be the minimum of respect to give an update on my situation, following all those comments.\n\nWell, meanwhile, the hammer dropped.  I've been fired.\n\nIn hindsight, the writing had been on the wall for the past few weeks.  My worst fears were confirmed in the span of five minutes.  In my exit interview, my boss made it clear that I was punching well above my weight by working for this company.  I did not have the capacity for analysis, the minutiae, or the interest and passion of my coworkers.\n\nWhen I asked him what my strong suit was, he visibly struggled to find an answer.  It finally amounted to: \"You're a really nice person.\"  Definitely not something I can put on my CV without getting laughed out of the room.\n\nWith that, I was handed the HR paperwork, given a bit of shut-up money, and sent on my merry way.\n\nAnd now I'm on the job market, needing to somehow start over and find a place that'll accept my mediocrity.  It's hard to smile at recruiters when you feel like damaged goods on the inside.\n\nI guess from here on out, it's not Reddit that I need, but a psychologist.",

            "selftext": "For some backstory, I recently left my first job out of college at the end of July. I was a software developer at a major healthcare software company, and while the job went smoothly at first, after about 8 months in, I started to have a hard time keeping up with the learning curve and managing the scope and deadlines on my projects. I didn't think I'd be happy/motivated enough to succeed at the job in the long term, so I voluntarily quit (albeit with the blessing/encouragement of my supervisors) after just over a year at the company. I didn't line up another job before leaving because I felt lost about where to go next, and I also fortunately had a significant amount of savings left over from the job as well as no debt from college.\n\nA month and a half later, I'm still feeling lost and confused, but I've been thinking about the field of computational geometry. In college, I developed interests in computer graphics, 3D modeling/CAD, and mathematical art/mathematical visualization. I also enjoyed all of the math and CS theory classes I took. Sometime last fall, I was reading Wikipedia and stumbled upon a link to their [article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_geometry) on computational geometry, and I was amazed to find that there was a field of study that united all of these interests! I've kept the term in the back of my mind since then, and now I'm thinking about incorporating it into future careers either in industry or academia.\n\nI'm thinking that I'd probably be best off applying to grad school in the near future and finding a short-term job in the meantime. I haven't looked into specific programs too much, but I've heard Professor Erik Demaine is a computational geometry specialist at MIT, so I might look into his work as a starting point. I don't have much actual experience/knowledge of the field yet, but I have some undergrad experience in math (linear algebra, discrete math, multivariable calculus, optimization) and graphics programming (using Java's OpenGL wrapper library), and I'm also comfortable using the 3D modeling software [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/). Do any of you have advice on where to go from here in terms of career paths?\n\n(As an aside, I stumbled upon [this somewhat similar post](https://www.reddit.com/r/proceduralgeneration/comments/6f240k/a_learning_path_for_computational_geometry/) on /r/proceduralgeneration earlier, which also seems to give good advice, albeit with less of a focus on career advice.)",

I'm one of those many young people trying to get their foot into the industry, but can't find the door.\n\nI'm an european student studying in the U.K on a software engineering degree. I've finished my 1st year and had to take a gap year to gather some money for my next year of university.\n\nI planned on getting a 1-year internship or a junior level job for 1 year in either software development or web development, but it seems like neither will become a reality.\n\nI've studied C++ in high-school, but only at an academic level solving mostly math-like problems. At university, we took Java from scratch and introduction into the web stack.\n\nI've got around 1 year and so of experience in web development, rating out of 5: HTML 4/5, CSS 4/5, PHP 3/5, SQL/MySQL 2/5, JavaScript 2/5. That being said, its not that I'm not confident on doing great work in either of these, I'm just being realistic about how much control and knowledge I consider that I have over them, all in all, I wouldn't encounter problems taking on big projects or doing stuff I never done cause I like to research and try and I always find a solution eventually. I'm also solid on agile principles and I've worked within university on group projects in a Scrum approach.\n\nI've developed a few websites through freelancing in collaboration with a local media agency, I've got my own web portfolio where some of the sites I developed are available, got a database management desktop app in Java which is also in github, got a Linkedin profile, tried to network around and comment on posts ( got people liking what I commented a few times ). And I've applied to more than 200 positions as either junior web developer, junior java developer, internship in web dev, internship in software dev in U.S/ U.K / Germany / France / Romania, out of those I got around 20 calls, out of those around 5 interviews and that's pretty much it. A lot of them seemed to really like me on the phone and that they 're looking forward to it, but haven't heard from them back. Most would call me or email me and then never get back at me. To some - where I considered to be appropriate - I pinged them ( emailed them asking about news ofc in a good manner ) and yeah, nothing. Out of 5 interviews, 3 of them found the right man for the job and 2 of em, I don't know.\n\nI love OOP, especially Java. I started learning Python as well. And I do like PHP, especially version 7. I'm not a huge fan of frontend development, but I've got days when I craft god damn beautiful things.\n\nHowever, I'm not a big fan of competitive programming, algorithmic questions and memorizing all sorts of stack/ queue / trees problems solutions nor am I a big fan of these types of interviews. \n\nI like crafting, creating, researching. I love it. I love programming, just not in the same way that others see it. If I need to solve a problem and I don't know x or y algorithm or design pattern, don't think I'll solve it in a miserable way without checking out the internet and researching what's already been done or what's out there.\n\nWould you be so kind to tell me what on earth am I doing wrong?\n\n",

            "selftext": "Hey guys, long story short; I have about 8 months until I enter my sophomore year at college (due to scheduling and family reasons, I got delayed a year) so I'm currently interning at this no name startup in SF doing development work in Python and Java. I really want to aim for Google or quant trading (or dev) internships (specifically Tower, DE Shaw, JSC) for my next internship after my sophomore year ends. Now after work I typically come home and go to the gym and I have around 3-4 hours that I feel I could make more use of. I'm doing questions out of leetcode, firecode.io and interviewbit for the CS side and I want to get better at those questions and I'm also thinking of doing arithmetic brain teasers (i.e. many math questions quickly in a row, finding sequences) and some Bayesian probability. I'm still a bit confused on what I should be doing now to make the next 8 months as productive as possible so that when I go back to school, I'm already ready and prepped for internship interviews. \n\nIt did make me quite sad to be delayed a year (and be separated from my first year friends) but I really didn't have much choice given the situation. I think there could be a silver lining to this situation where I'm working in SF making decent money, going to the gym and taking care of myself and also using this extra time to get ahead of the competition and get those internships that I've always wanted.\n\nFor people that have interned at Big N or quant firms as traders (or devs) I would love to hear about your interview prep plans. I'm not sure if I should focus on improving my C++ (I guess thats more on the execution side) or if I should take a course on machine learning (I've already taken the Coursera one before), but I wanna hear your opinion on if that's a good avenue to pursue.\n\nI did a brain teaser for Akuna and IMC before but screwed it up - don't wanna do that the second time around. Also did 2 rounds of Uber before bombing that too.\n\nA plan, websites, courses or anything really that might help me land and/or prep for interviews is appreciated. Thanks",

            "selftext": "Hi,\n\nLooking for some feedback, here are some recent interview situations I've encountered, I really don't know if it's me or them but at times I don't fully know what they are looking for, or in hindsight, knowing what they were looking for... it just felt odd.\n\n\n*\"I'm going to describe a problem I solved recently. I know there are multiple ways it could have been solved but I want you to solve it the way I did, otherwise I will stop you.\"*\n\nHe was right, it was a very general question. I went down a different path, once he stopped me, my 2nd choice was correct. However, the feedback was, I seemed good but I would take too long to get up to speed at their company. This just seemed odd. This wasn't a situation where his answer was O(n) and mine was O(n^2) or something, this was a much more general question on a webapp, of which there were any number of equally valid answers. I feel like I was ruled out for not \"guessing\" the answer in his mind. What was the goal here? What can I learn?\n\n\n*\"Solve <an algorithm question>. I'm looking for best time and space complexity\"*\n\nI solved it 2 different ways explaining how each was better for either time or space. Later internet search confirms I was correct.\n\n*\"Ok well, it works... but we could do better...\"*\n\nI'm not grasping it, I fumble around saying I could do it functionally but that would be slower.\n\n*\"No, you don't know functional programming? Hmmm\"*\n\nMe: \"Yes, I do, but it would be slower than the answers on the board\". He disagreed. I didn't get the job, he was clearly looking for someone who's first answer would be a functional approach and ruled me out. I understand functional programming, but in this case it was just the \"fancy\" approach, not the fastest. He walked away feeling smart for knowing the functional way, I walked away thinking he was an idiot who didn't understand when functional programming was the appropriate answer. Is this me? Or him in this case?\n\n\n*\"Solve this <algorithm question>\"*\n\nIf was a bit complex, I couldn't do better than O(n log n) time and he seemed unhappy, so I wracked my brain for a faster approach but couldn't find it. He still wasn't happy. He kept looking at the paper infront of him. Finally he said *\"What if we do this...\"* and wrote an alternative on the board. His answer was also O(n log n) but basically a refactoring of my code which required him to implement a new class specifically to return the result as a new Object type instead of a primitive. \n\nMy takeaway was, you didn't need to create a new class just for the return object, but the piece of paper he had clearly had that answer. Mine worked without doing that, but my takeaway was, since it wasn't what was on his paper, he couldn't understand my answer. I didn't get the job and told my algorithm question was not correct. I felt, if anything, the problem was he couldn't understand any code that wasn't exactly what was on his piece of paper. Again, I felt it was odd. His report was I was bad at algorithms, yet I felt he lacked the ability to see his answer was more complicated and unnecessary.\n\n\n*\"Here's an application I built, you have 30 minute to do a full code review on it and I'll read it later\"*\n\nOk, I can do that. But I don't know what the goal was here. If I'm reviewing my own teams code, I have domain knowledge. If I submit my code for a secure code review, those guys don't argue about variable names, they report on their specific domain, security vulnerabilities... and so on with other teams/people who could review it. In this instance, I'm just looking for clear mistakes, ambiguity or maybe obvious areas where time complexity could easily be improved.... but in general. How should I approach this? How I code review something with no domain knowledge will be very different from how someone else does, especially if they have the domain knowledge... it feels like a fruitless task to ask someone without domain knowledge to point out all the same things, you the interviewer, KNOW, as you have the domain knowledge.\n\n\n*\"Here are the rules of a game. You have 1 hour to implement\"*\n\nIt required me to build input data structures from scratch, menial task but wasted 20 minutes of the 1 hour. The \"rules\" were quite ambiguous, I had to ask a lot of questions as they seemed to conflict. The interviewer didn't really know the answer to my questions. I am also not a game developer and this was not in any way a game related field. What was the point? At the very least, give me the starting data already built and let me write the functionality? Or give me an interviewer who understands the game too and can answer my questions.\nInterviewer also prompted me several times that my code was wrong, it was not, they were clearly a Python developer and didn't understand I had to write things differently as the task was in Java.\n\nPhone screen with VP of Engineering: \n\n*\"I see you have several years of web development experience, that's perfect, we're looking for someone with 4+ years of React\"*\n\nMe: \"Um, yes, my current company doesn't use React currently but I'm a strong JavaScript developer and have used several frameworks, I wouldn't have a problem being asked to learn React\" (React has not existed for 4+ years????)\n\n*\"Hmm... I see, no we don't want JavaScript developers, we want React Developers, good bye\"*\n\n(Um... fair enough if he wants someone currently using React, that's his prerogative, what does the VP of Engineering think React is exactly if he doesn't want strong JavaScript developers)\n\n\n*\"How would you Unit Test some code usually?\"*\n\nI talked at length but he was clearly unhappy. I spoke about the tools I have used, TDD, integration with CI/CD, types of test cases I'd usually be thinking of, various edge cases. Clearly it wasn't what he wanted as an answer. What would someone posing this question be looking for?\n\n\nSystem Design question *\"<Some question about deadlocks,concurrency, etc> How would this be solved?\"*\n\nI described several standard approaches and tried to explain that the exact one someone would implement would depend on the actual system we are describing.\n\n*\"Ok, well, which one would you pick?\"*\n\nAsked him some questions about the system to determine which would be the appropriate answer as it was too ambiguous to just \"pick the best one\".\n\n*\"I don't know, you need to just pick the best one and tell me why\"*\n\nBut... that depends on the answer to the question as you haven't explained the system we are designing here.\n\n*\"Well, I guess you don't know then... let's just move on to an easier question for you\"*\n\nEh......????\n\nAnd so on...\n\nTL:DR; Half the time, I don't know if it's me not knowing something, them no knowing something, or the questions just being overly ambiguous. I feel like interviewing is a big game and I seemed to miss the memo on the rules.",

I still don't really understand the old codebase, and I often find myself asking my coworkers a lot of questions. About a week or so ago, my boss had a one on one meeting with me, where he said that it was partially the company's fault for not really having any code documentation (for example, several of the code repos have no readMe, and a lot of the legacy code is written in outdated languages/frameworks (sometimes, without any documentation describing what they were written in)), but, on the other hand, I need to be more selective about the questions I ask, to make sure I'm not bothering the other engineers too much.\n\nIs this a minor issue that I'm overreacting to, or is this a sign that I'm on thin ice? Should I start looking for a new job immediately? Will being fired after a few months negatively impact my resume? Should I quit rather than get fired, so it looks better to future employers?\n",

            "selftext": "So I went back to school for CS at 25 and did my first year last year. I got a 8 week internship via a government program working on a pretty old .net application over the summer. That's my only software experience to date but I really liked it. Sure the tech was old, but the team felt fun, it was challenging and I felt like I actually contributed (my code went to production). I still feel like I barely know anything though, I feel like anybody else could had done this work also, but my team lead said I did good and that they were impressed. I feel like \"I'm not good enough\" though because I feel like anybody could have won this competition.\nMy interview question was explaining basic OOP. Apparently the other guy couldn't do it. \n\nThe team expressed wanting to keep me while I go to school and talked about offering me a non student part time contract which is about double what I was making as a student and reflects the pay that I would get if I stayed with them after graduation, however they are not sure if they can offer me that pay level during summers due to a bunch of rules. \n\nBut they have talked about offering me a full time job when I finish school, at around 70k (as of now, could be higher they said) with an indexed pension, benefits, At 37.5 hours a week. Hours are flexible, remote work is possible, and I would cap out in a few years in the mid 90s unless I go up another level in such case I would cap out near 110 ish. The work that I'm doing now counts towards my pension years. Also once you're in the job security is really nice. \n\nIn comparison my friend that's graduating has a 120k ish total comp package for a big N in my country with benefits, no pension. However he has to live in a city with a higher COL and a longer comute. \n\nNow I'm in second year and I have the option to apply for a few winter internships but not where I currently work.  This would delay my graduations however  and I'm not sure if that's a good idea... My school doesn't offer every course at every session so it can be tough to catch up. For example i only need 30 courses to graduate(3 years) but I have to do 4 years because of course availability...  After this fall semester I have 18 courses left.\n\nI'm not sure if I should be looking at getting multiple internships or if I should be banking on my current employer. I don't graduate for a few years so it's not like the job is guaranteed 100%, I know things could change. However i have talked to employees where I work and a few of \n them did get the same offer i did while they where in school and the employer followed through after their graduation. Some students did not get return offers also.\n\nWould having .net experience force me to stay in the .net ecosystem. \n\nI'm worried that having no private experience would limit me to the public sector.\n\nPrivate sector seems like it pays more but I'm not sure which is overall better. \n\nWhat would you guys do in this situation.\n\nTldr: I'm really not sure what to do and I can't seem to shrink my situation down to 3 lines lol.

I am starting to look into graduate jobs for next year (graduating June 2018) and I would really like to put myself on a path that in the future could enable me to move to the US. I studied abroad for a year in America and absolutely love the idea of returning for work.\n\nI previously summer interned at a multinational bank doing mostly Java development, and this year I have interned at a start-up doing .NET web development. I enjoy the web stuff, especially front-end design, but I feel like it could limit my opportunities as far as travel goes(?) because it seems less specialist.\n\nWhat I'd really like to know is what people consider more important - getting the right skills to enable me to be headhunted to work in the US (does this actually happen?) or instead focusing on a specific company that I know has multinational operations in the US and then trying to leverage that. Naturally both seem important.\n\nAny general advice would be welcome. I understand that the process is very challenging, especially for a new graduate, but I would really like to put myself in a position whereby I could get a visa or sponsorship through a company in the future. I understand this process will takes years. As far as specific areas in the US go, I really loved my time in the South. Nashville, Raleigh, Greenville all appeal to me as cities but frankly I am not picky!\n\nAre there specific fields, companies or approaches that anyone would suggest I look into? I feel I have a really general skill set currently because I have experience in both electronic engineering and software development.\n\nCheers :-)",

I somehow managed to never be introduced to OOP until I took 2 research projects writing Android Apps at Uni. As soon as I did the first research project I had realized I made the wrong major choice but I had only one year to go to finish my BS in ME so I just finished. \n\nI worked at my last employer for 1.5 years as an intern and was promoted to a Manufacturing Engineer before I quit because all I could think about was getting into SWEing. I quickly enrolled in community college to get a SWE certificate, which I kind of regret because the courses are way too slow and learning on my own is faster. I am making the best of it and practicing mostly on my own making what I can in C# and I am finally learning Entity Framework and want to develop a CRUD application to prove my competence in SWE despite me being an ME by education. \n\nI see everyone here constantly raving about internships and their relevance to a career, but I just don't feel like I can get one because of the time frame for the certificate I am getting. I will finish in May and most internship requirements are that I am pursuing a BS in comp sci or SWE. Should I just say screw the internships and focus on developing a few personal projects before May? Or am I actually able to get an internship? (I am in the Philly area).\n\nSo the TL;DR of this is: I am a Penn State Mechanical Engineering graduate who quit his job to focus on switching to a SWE.

I received a written offer through a 3rd party recruiter for a 6 month contract position, signed it, and filled out all the paperwork for the recruiter. That was over a month ago, I am still waiting on the company itself to do the background check and set an official start date.\n\nI was told when they signed the offer that they'd want me to start immediately after they finished the background and to expect that before the end of August. So I went ahead and gave notice and left my old job. \n\nI've now been out of work for almost a month and I really wasn't expecting this long without an income. I have plenty of cushion, but I'd prefer not to eat into those savings. So I'm going to start job searching again.\n\n---\n\n**Actual question**:\n\nI had someone suggest to me that I should ask the recruiter for a retainer fee before I start job searching. Is this something that is actually done? If I ask, how much should I ask for? Any general advice around this situation?",

Because if it was asked in an iOS interview, we can be sure that the interviewers thought that this question is appropriate for the the type of work and experience that an iOS dev does. It would better calibrate us to know what types of things we *should* know as an iOS dev.

However for my previous position, unfortunately it was evaluated and i got more or less the equivalent of 0, which i pointed out to my current boss and he told me not to worry about it at all. \n\nUnfortunately our director seems to think differently, since according to his spreadsheet i have had two disastrous OKR's in a row, and apparently it is unwritten policy to put someone on a PIP for that situation. Even after pointing out over and over again that it is not possible for my to completely those OKR's because i didn't even work for that team, he just doesn't seem to care. \n\nBoth of my bosses have tried to talk to our director about this, but apparently higher ups review OKR results and i was singled out. \n\nWhile i don't care if i need to do a PIP, unfortunately it is a big black mark on my record in my opinion.

Is it worth it for me to apply to these internships, or should I stick to the freshmen/sophomore programs?",

I have been wanting to enter the field of Website Development because it seems like an interesting field and one that I'd like a lot. I was telling my brother that I was signed up for this field and he told me he was talking to an electrical engineer at his work that told him she had tried the CS field but it was incredibly hard and she had to switch Major's. My biggest thing is that she switched to electrical engineering which has way more math than CS does and she still said it was way too hard to do. It just has me second guessing myself I guess and I'm questioning whether or not this field is right for me. I know no one here knows me and I'm going to have to decide for myself after taking CS classes whether or not it's right for me but I'm mainly looking for some experiences from those of you who got their degree.",

I am now salary and they are paying me at market rate ($60k/yr for my position/location, which I am very happy with). I decided to follow up my last post with a 3-month update on how things are going.\n\n**It's not that bad.** A new job is a whole lot of 'new' in your life and it's a lot to absorb. You should stick with it, good or bad, and then make your decision on whether or not you like it after 3 months. \n\nI was freaking out at the start because I had no idea how to do basically anything and was given several coding tasks which I thought was expected of me to get done in a day or two, but ended up taking several weeks. Most of my coding tasks didn't work properly and pulled time away from my boss to fix them. I felt detrimental to the company. After 1 month in, I was picking up on how everything is connected within the code base. I am now solving tickets with bug fixes, or adding new pages/tools to the company product. Coding work gets much easier with experience, almost to the point where you don't have to think as hard, just pressing F8 constantly while debugging to see where the problem is. \n\n\nBut to be honest, my office is very boring: it is dark, there are no windows, it is dead silent silent even though it's an open office (it's a small company, only 10 people in the room, 2 of which are the software engineers). No one likes to talk that much.\n\n**To get over this dull environment, I found solutions that work well for me.**\n\n1. Biggest one: keeping windows nightlight (or flux) on permanently, **reducing blue light** emitted from your monitor. Staring at a bright monitor in a dim room for 8 hours was giving me a headache and ruining my mood at the end of every workday. I noticed a HUGE improvement in my mood after doing this.\n2. **Going on a walk outside** around the building every 1-2 hours. This gives me a chance to get sunlight and to clear my head.\n3. **Eating breakfast** and food at my desk every hour (bananas, apples w/ peanut butter, pretzels, chips).\n4. **No caffeine.** This is so I don't go 100 MPH when coding and stress out over small things.\n5. **Changing my perspective**. I've been reading some philosophy on how to enjoy work and life in general. Life is what you make of it, try not to stress out about every task, rather you should enjoy the process of it (it's about the journey, not the destination). Don't live your live like a checklist and merit your worth on how productive you are. Try to enjoy every moment.\n\n\nI am happy that I am learning a lot of contemporary frameworks (such as react w/ redux), AWS integration, and commercial programming architecture just to name a few. It's awesome to see the entire code that's needed to run a business product. I have constant entrepreneurial thoughts, and this alone is invaluable experience.\n\nOutside of the office, I have recently moved to a new apartment with two friends from college. I now have my own room, AC, cable TV, and an insect-free kitchen. This has also made my life much better.\n\nAnyways, I hope this post helps out anyone who needs it.",

Here is some backstory on my situation:\n\n\nI'm a new graduate who recently landed my first programming job at a large bank. I was added into a brand new team as the second of four programmers, that notably consisted of all new hires.\n\nIn my interview, I were told that the project we were going to be working on was built using C# and Angular. It was at that point I explicitly told them I had no experience in either. They decided they wanted to hire me anyways (I should note that the 'technical' interview was extremely easy, questions you might ask a first year student. Which was a red flag for me). I assumed that since they wanted to hire me, that I would be placed on an experienced team that I would be able to quickly learn from, so I accepted the offer.\n\nLast week the last developer joined the team, and this is how our team looks on paper.\n\n* 3 new graduates (in various fields), none with C# or Angular experience.\n\n* 1 developer with one year experience, small amount of Angular experience, and no C# experience.\n\nNow that we have our team fully formed, we will soon start working on projects, and I am worried that nobody (including myself) will be able to perform. Management has made a point of telling us that they have high expectations for us, but I don't see us meeting that expectation.\n\nIt also should be noted that I like the team and the management, they are all good people, but I feel like we have been set up for failure.\n\n------\n\n\nSo my questions, are:\n\n* Is it normal to have a team consisting of new graduates?\n\n* Should I bring up my concerns to management?\n\nAny advice in general on how to deal with this situation would be helpful, it has been a significant source of stress for me. \n\n------\n**tl;dr**\n\nBrought onto a dev team consisting of mostly new graduates (several are not CS grads) who are all completely unfamiliar with the tech stack we will be using, which will soon be expected to perform with high expectations from management.

We are one of the leaders in our field and we have around 1500 employees world wide. In the past 1.5 years, I have fully mastered and understood the architecture of one of our products. Not only I can customize it for our clients, I can hack it and make it do things it was not designed to do (many of my hacks are now included in the out-of-the-box product). I am confident to say only the inventor of this product know it better than I do in the whole company. \n\nWhile I am confident and think I fully deserve the promotion, I have seen developers/software engineers frown upon people with Senior title without 5-10 years of experience. I am the youngest and \u201cfreshest\u201d Sr. Dev in my company, but my colleagues know me well enough, so I am not worry there. I am worry about people who do not know me (e.g. new employers when I search for new position or fellow developers/SEs in networking session). Should I even put Senior Developer on my resume? I think I can explain and convince prospective employers, but what if I don\u2019t even get the chance to explain? \u201cHuh? Senior Developer in 1.5 years? This guy must be lying.

I recently got extended this past summer and was officially put on the org chart because I wasn't a temporary employee anymore.\n\nHowever, when they put me under there they put my job title as \"Web Designer Intern\". I do some front-end and design stuff, but I also do a lot of back-end and even ops stuff for their web applications. On my offer sheet and all my paperwork, the title is stated as \"Web Developer Intern\".\n\nI have this position listed still as Web Developer Intern on my resume, LinkedIn, etc. My main worry is for when I graduate and start looking for full-time jobs I am worried that when companies check references with my current company they'll think that I am lying.\n\nIf it matters, my manager / supervisor and co-workers acknowledge me as a Web Developer, but apparently not HR.\n\nShould I see about getting this fixed?

My career question therefore is: what technologies/languages/frameworks are best for finding good remote freelance work?\n\nBy good I mean a technology that has a good balance of both high earning potential and good availability of work.\n\nIdeally, I'd like to concentrate on .NET backend web development with light frontend work, however my general impression after researching is that it's quite difficult to find freelance remote work for this area and it's also not as lucrative as JS or mobile development. \n\nA couple of other important factors/related questions:\n\n* In order to maximize tax savings (US tax law is an outlier when it comes to expats), I plan to create a Panama based corporation and want to only accept clients who are OK with paying me through my corp (not sure if this affects quantity and/or quality of prospective clients)\n* Two things that may or may not provide a marketing advantage for myself: (1) I plan on concentrating nearly 100% of my travels to the Western Hemisphere which will mean I will be in the same time zone as my US clients. (2) I have a BS in Software Engineering from a well recognized university\n* My goal is to solidify an hourly rate of $80 (I'm ok with building toward that over time) and would ultimately like to be able to charge over $100/hr after a few years. My impression is that .NET rates hover between 50-80 but iOS rates tend to more easily reach 100 and in many case well over 100. Is this at all accurate? And how close are Android rates to iOS rates?\n* While I'm not completely UI/UX illiterate, I do excel much more in areas that are hard to build a visual portfolio off of. Does this make building a remote freelancing career significantly more difficult? \n* Xamarin mobile development also looks like a perfect area for me given my .NET and limited previous Android experience. Anybody have experience with that job market?\n\nThanks in advance for any info or recommendations!",

I started out programming by taking Python classes on Coursera in early 2016, and have finished my Front-End certification on Free Code Camp in June. I am currently working on their Back-End certification, learning Node and Mongo at the moment, I really like FCC's style and curriculum. I'm currently attending college online (Champlain College, in Burlington VT) for software development, with 1.5 to 2 years until I finish. I'm taking C++ 1 at Champlain, and after the spring with C++ 2 I'll have a C++ certificate from them before I finish my bachelors. I am interested in eventually working in data science, but that could be 2-3 years down the line minimum. I have done some Python freelance work, but nothing too big. \n\nI work fulltime at a group home for adults at night at $13/hr, one week on and one week off. I am able to get 2-3 hours of free time each shift at work to do homework, or any other projects. I feel like I'm capable of learning new programming skills independently reasonably quickly with good direction and advice, but I have am very much a novice. \n\nThe internship in question is full time, designed for CS students, and pays $15/hr. They say it can last up to 8 months, typically Jan-Aug. I am skeptical of applying for the internship, my thinking being that I could learn a lot more on my own in that time period, or that I'll hit a wall with what I'll be working on, or the fact that I'll lose the 2-3 hrs of free paid time I get currently at work, which I make great use of, for only $2/hr more. Thank you for reading my long-winded question, your advice and insight is extremely valuable to me.\n\nTLDR: Take full time internship in small town for likely 6-8 months, or use the time to advance my skills and work on projects through college, Free Code Camp, Youtube, and other online resources? \n",

            "selftext": "When I turned 17 I was a hardcore gamer, spending 14-16 hours a day when I had no school, or sometimes skipping school to play video games. I didn't consider myself stupid, but I didn't prioritize my life. Eventually I got my act together and after high school went to a community college for 2 years and transferred to one of the best engineering schools in the country to study CS. I did absolutely nothing in my free time in those 2 years besides study iOS development. I built games, utility apps, quest apps, and I published 4 of them on the app store.\n\nI spent those every waking minute not doing schoolwork instead doing leetcode and studying algorithms. I interned for a big N at the end of my sophomore year before I came to my uni as a transfer. Even now, all I do is study algorithms, ARkit, and more CS in general in my spare time. I have zero friends that I call friends who I hang out with, but I do socialize with other people about CS. \n\nMy school has a lot of TAs here who come from everywhere in the world for their masters/phds in CS, and I unofficially use them for mock interviews, discussing different algorithms with different run time complexities, and more data structures. They are supposed to be used for projects/labs, which is the case with 99% of students, but I finish those assignments within several hours tops usually when we still have 3 weeks to turn them in.\n\nI essentially turned my video game addiction into a CS addiction. But there is a difference. While I have zero qualms about my career prospects or my job-readiness, I feel absolutely miserable. I constantly question whether life is worth living. \n\nTomorrow, I'm going to spend 7-8 hours (my saturday) in the CS lounge talking to TAs about hashsets, b+ trees, and hash table implementations. Not because I want to, but the alternative is doing nothing. I don't have anything else to look forward to in my life. I don't want to get back into gaming because I view it as lost productivity nowadays. I just sit in my room and code all day long. ",

I graduated from a top 20 school in the nation about a year ago, and joined a third tier bank in New York as a software engineer. It was the first job I got so I was happy that I atleast had a job. I have been at the bank for about a year now and I hated it from the beginning. \n\n2017 hasn't been a particularly good year for me. My girlfriend left me at the beginning of the year, then my dog died and then two of my uncles died. So I was dealing with all that on top of not being happy at work which is where I spent most of my time. I don't know many people in New York so it started to get really lonely and I wanted to go out and meet people but wanted to fix my work situation first. So its my first summer in New York, the city of dreams, I decided to put all the personal stuff aside and try to fix my work situation first. I have basically spend all the free time I had for the past four months, at work, every weekend, every day after work, learning doing practice interview questions and trying to find another job. Overall I ended up applying to about a 100 jobs, the majority of which never replied, and most of them rejected me straight away. Out of the 5 that actually responded to me (three are the biggest tech companies and two big hedge funds), I ended up going to final onsite for three of them and got rejected at that point. At this point I have pretty much exhausted all the jobs that I think I qualified for. Its really depressing because I have a big 4 internship on my resume as well so its really tough to be in this giant city with so much opportunity and with my best effort but being unable to secure any kind of other job.\n\nNot being ungrateful for what I have, because no matter how bad it is, atleast I still have a job that pays for my rent, but it is just really hard to know that you gave something your all and you thought you could do it but the world ends up punching you in the stomach saying you are not good enough. \n\nAt this point with all the rejections and everything else that has happened, its really hard to do anything for me and not feel depressed and just give up. Have any of you faced a similar situation and any advice on how to deal with it?",

I got hired a bit more than a year ago as a software developer into the team that's responsible for a set of microservices that are used as a translation layer between other bigger chunks of the system. That sounded as an exciting opportunity to me, so I jumped it.\n\nHowever, after 2 or 3 months, one of the legacy proprietary closed-sourced applications that we heavily rely on started having some big issues and our team was tasked to solve that. \n\nAbout 6 months ago, we have raised the issue that this is not maintainable - the application was inherently flawed, there was no way to fix it completely. The management has agreed, and has made a decision to replace this application by developing an in-house solution. That sounded great to me, as this is exactly what I was hoping for at this job - writing some performant HA microservices, however...\n\nFirst priority that management has raised was to stabilize this current application that we use. That meant: upgrade to latest version, migrate all configuration (TONS of it, approximately 3 months of work by itself), add clustering, add monitoring, add alerting, single pane of glass with metrics, automated DR, immutable infrastructure around it, etc etc. Everything becomes much more complicated when it's closed source with almost no documentation around it.\n\nFast forward a year, all our team does is maintaining this application. I would say that 95% of work is related to fixing/maintaining/firefighting/etc around it. Also, most of the work sounds like OPS stuff, not DEV stuff. By my current estimates, it would take another 6-9 months to complete this backlog of maintenance.\n\n**So, to summarize:**\n\n* Great culture, great salary, superb work-life balance, benefits, colleagues, etc.\n* Backlog of 6-9 months of work that I agree is very important, but not DEV-related and basically around maintaining legacy closed-source proprietary junk.\n* Promise from the management, that after the backlog is done - we will finally start developing this software that will be great.\n\nFrom one side - I would love to finally work on that replacement project. I have already drafted the architecture and it sounds incredibly fun to me. \n\nFrom the other side - I hate the work I'm doing right now. It's useless for my professional development, it brings almost no transferable skills.\n\nPlease help me make the decision, reddit.",

            "selftext": "Hello all. \n\nI have just started contributing to Mozilla's Firefox browser for Desktop. So far I've successfully completed four bugs. I have started with low-hanging fruit, like replacing legacy code with new implementations, with one of the bugs being a more involved bug that required a bit more back and forth between me and the mentor for said bug. Here are the challenges I'm facing:\n\n* It takes a while to become good enough. \n\nTo be clear, the Mozilla guys are *amazing*. Real life is not. By that I mean, as much as I find contributing meaningful, it takes a while before you have quantifiable skills that you can put on a resume. In between taking the time to understand the codebase and writing patches, you *do* get skills, but it looks like it'll be a while before I feel adequate enough to apply for internships and/or jobs. It makes my contributing feel like a waste of time. More so in this age of FreeCodeCamp's posts about how people get their first developer jobs and so on. \n\n\n\n\n* It takes me a while to solve a bug.\n\nFor this, I'm going to use my knowledge of JavaScript as an example. Now since I've been exposed to programming languages enough times (I've studied PHP as part of a webdev class, C as part of introduction to programming, and Java as well. Didn't do anything with them), I can recognize flow control structures and declaration of variables. But I have been undecided on whether to really go through a JS tutorial since it feels like I already know what they are introducing in the beginning stages of the tutorials while on the other hand, the Firefox code seems beyond me for some reason. My initial approach was to Google everything, but there are parts of the codebase that don't lend itself well to that. So I feel stranded.\n\nAny tips, help or advice that the community can provide is much appreciated.",

I think Infosys is a better option for me with benefits and training experience and the fact they do projects with governments too. And after reading the attached documents from TCS offer, I think they're a bit strict and kind of slow with HR process.

            "selftext": "After graduating from university, I got pretty lost what to do next and I decided to chase what interested me a lot. I always wanted to create web platforms and services but I was afraid when I was young to go and study CS. \n\nThen, after graduating, I literally locked myself in the house and worked really hard on learning programming. Now, it's been 3 years and I can create any web platform/service that I imagine, take freelance jobs; in fact, my money is kind of finished and working as a freelancer started demotivating me (because clients don't know what they want, always want it cheap etc). And being at home constantly started depressing me a bit too.\n\nI think I want to go work on a startup company and be more active in life. I am kind of curious about that life now, which I absolutely didn't want 3 years ago. \n\nNow, I want to ask, if you were in my shoes, would you go and do a Software Engineering Masters just to get the degree and then, maybe a MBA? Or try to get a job? If I can sit on the interview table, I believe I can present my skills. \n\nAlthough, I am not sure if I want to write code as a full-time job. I love being able to do it, but I am not sure if I want to do it 9-5 for the rest of my life. However, I definitely want programming/development to be involved.\n\nP.S: I know I am not senior level or anything. I just love the challenge of creating something and the reward when I achieve it. My current level is: I have been using Laravel for 2 years, can build stuff with vue, react, etc (also dig into Unity, Apple Swift but didn't try to get great on them). Worked on stuff like integrating payment systems (Stripe/Paypal), writing chrome extensions, building api, mobile applications, web scrapers etc. \n\nP.S.2: Most of my projects were not finished because I was doing them just for learning, and they stayed in a folder. And my github profile is pretty empty. For the last 6 months, I started feeling confident and am actually releasing my projects as products.\n\nP.S.3: I graduated from uni at the age of 22 and currently, I am 25 yo.\n\nP.S.4: My aim was not to be the best programmer or anything, I was just loving the idea of creating something that I imagine. I have equal interest towards Marketing and I spent some time reading/learning/experimenting this too. Most of the development I do is based on Marketing tools actually.\n\nP.S.5: When I first started, I didn't have any programmers around me, and to be honest, I was feeling like I am far far behind the competition. I currently sticked my nose to the social life, and realised I am not that bad after all. I think I freaked out of staying far behind, and I sprinted which boosted me and I know as much as 50% of the graduates I met and had a chat. I think most people I met who studied didn't really put much effort after they finished their degree. (Of course I met some people too which were faaar better than myself, but it made me more ambitious willing to be as good as them)\n\nI would really appreciate your ideas, suggestions and feedbacks. Thanks in advance.\n\n(If I asked the question on wrong subreddit, please warn me and I move the question to the right one)",

However my start date came for my job that I had an offer for and I stupidly put it on my LinkedIn. And I say stupidly because the recruiter I previously mentioned wished me congrats on my new job. To which I told him, \"thank you, let's stay in touch in when I look for new opportunities\".\n\nThree weeks into my current job, I have realized this is not for me because the technologies I'm using are not the ones advertised and it won't allow me to grow as a developer(this place is not a good place for tech) . The nail in the coffin was when I went to an IT expo for this job to take a look at the other IT departments and absolutely none of them interested me. I've also been told I would have to stay on my current team for 1.5-2 years. So I've decided to start looking elsewhere and yes took it off my LinkedIn. \n\nWould it be too soon to go back to that recruiter (I sent the message three weeks ago) and try to re start the process? \n\nTL;DR: Told recruiter we should stay in touch because I started a new job however it turns out job isn't a fur for me , can I go back to said recruiter(span of 3 weeks).

            "selftext": "Recently I've been digging around for opportunities.\n\nThe sense I get from many of the \"trendy\" tech companies (some of which I think I might like working with) is that on-campus/workplace culture is a BIG part of working for them. So much so that as an applicant who can't relocate, they may not give you two glances. It's seeming like a deal-breaker. I get that.... to a degree.\n\nI also get that there is an incredibly valuable talent pool of individuals who simply can not relocate. I happen to be one. Sure, the \"right\" remote worker may be harder to find given all of the obvious challenges, but doesn't it become worth the risk when there's the possibility of employing some great talent out there?\n\nI think this conundrum is inline with recent jobs/employment numbers that have come out. The idea is that there's disconnect between these numbers because there are jobs available, but the people who can fill them may not be in the right place at the right time, and they aren't willing to relocate.\n\nI've been very successful working for companies as a remote employee for about 4 years now. It has its challenges and it isn't for everyone, but I believe that for the right person, every company should be willing to make this kind of arrangement work.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?",

I'd absolutely welcome any advice offered on those topics, but I realize that my issues there are going to extend beyond the scope of this subreddit and CS-specific career advice in general. That said, this is my situation:\n\n* I'm in my early 30s. I've been out of the workforce more or less entirely for about seven years due to a combination of family and health issues that spiraled out of control. I have an associate's degree (pre-engineering) and I was about a year's worth of credits short of completing a BS in chemical engineering. My background in math is solid, but not exceptional - diff. eq., linear algebra, and discrete math.\n* I've been programming in one form or another since I was about 12. I'm entirely self-taught, which I realize is probably a huge red flag. I'd consider my technical skills to be fairly competent, but very generalist. I have a reasonably good grasp on theoretical topics (ie, algorithmic complexity, graph theory, data structures, design patterns, etc.) - at least good enough that I don't have a huge issue with the sorts of example whiteboard interview questions I've run across.\n* I've contributed to a few open source projects and I'm very comfortable with Git and version control in general, but most of the work I've done has been on my own projects. There's probably more than enough to build some kind of portfolio out of, but again I realize this is probably another pretty big red flag.\n* I've done some very sporadic contract work, but the truth is that self-promotion isn't one of my strengths. All of the projects I've worked on have been successful, but I've never been able to land enough reliable work for this to be a stable or meaningful source of income.\n* I'm located on the east coast and the aforementioned family issues would make it difficult or impossible for me to move across the country for work. I'm unfortunately stuck in the job market that's within commuting distance for me, although that *technically* extends out to NYC.\n\nSo clearly I have a fairly large uphill battle ahead of me. I'm confident that I'm at least qualified enough for some entry-level positions, but the issue is actually getting to the interview stage in the first place. Is there anything I can do to potentially make myself more attractive to potential employers? Are there specific projects I should be working on to fill out my lack of actual work experience? Should I continue to seek out freelance work? I would greatly appreciate any and all advice.",

I got a job as an SRE at a startup. Before that I had a job at my school as a sysadmin and before that I had 3 internship at a big corporation (not the big4 ... think of a bank. This corporation wasn't technical or software oriented at all). There isn't a lot of good tech jobs where I'm at so I was lucky to find my startup job. I was planning to stay for 2-3 years but they ended up telling me that if I want to get paid the same as developers I should keep my SRE tasks AND do product development so I left at my one year mark lol (more about this later).\n\n**The prep + search**\n\nMy resume looks pretty good. I can send it to people interested but for one year there's a crap ton on my resume. I was working at a startup doing two people's worth of work ... I worked more than 40+ hours every week and I learned a lot. I came home everyday and read and read and read about everything. A bit about me:\n\n* My skill set is infrastructure, all services in AWS, networking, linux, configuration management, security, automation, etc. \n* Languages I use are Python, Bash and Go. (Though I have familiarity with a lot more that I don't list on my resume) \n* I'm a good programmer too. My github profile has 3-4 nice projects in there. \n\nI was a bit confused on what to study for interviews. I tried leetcode and hackerrank and while I love solving algo problems, I thought no one would ask me those during interviews (and they didn't). After I interviewed a bit **I noticed that SRE interviews focus a lot on deep knowledge of linux, system design, AWS, being able to code in 1-2 languages and the coding challenges revolved around infrastructure i.e automation, deployment, consuming APIs, manipulating responses from APIs, filesystem manipulation, why this use this vs that etc** so there was no algo questions. \n\n**I prepared by reading even more. Focusing on Linux and Networking. In my spare time I also wrote some neat code to practice for live coding interviews. I did this every single day.** \n\n**My interview skills** \n\n* Technical interviews that are just a discussion with team members: I'm good at these. I can talk about infrastructure all day and since I have some experience, I love these interviews. They actually don't feel like interviews, they feel like a discussion with someone with similar interests. \n\n* Live coding: I don't like these lol. But I knew they are inevitable. I ended up being good at them. I feel like a lot depends on who is your interviewer but generally my tips are to **make sure you understand what they are asking. Ask questions and clarify and speak your thoughts! Also make sure to divide the problem into smaller ones if you find it challenging. Step by step! clarify these with your interviewer. Speak up!** I know it's hard to keep talking and thinking and coding!! but let the interviewer know about your plan and ask questions! they will help you out. Practice makes perfect! if you are slow, practice!\n\n* The rest of the interviews were take home challenges. \n\n\n**My failures and what I could have done better** \n\n* So many times recruiters called me \"too junior\". Even if I fit their job description, they'd say they need someone with more years of experience. It was depressing. I can't wait to get to 5 years of experience. \n\n* I got rejected from one of my favorite companies after doing well in the interviews. I think I came off as too slow on the live coding interview. Practice makes perfect! \n\n* I couldn't get remote roles because I was too junior for some companies.\n\n**Success!**\n\n* I got an offer from one of my favorite companies. The salary is great and the culture is amazing. \n\n* I applied to Google for fun and got a call back in less than 12 hours later. I was stunned. Obviously I can't relocate and they don't offer remote roles so I had to pass on the interviews but I'm keeping in touch. Same with Yelp and Linkedln. \n\nSome people say that you should Find a job before you quit your current job. And I would agree if you have to financially support yourself and a family but I had enough saved up. I think this allowed me to only focus on finding jobs and scheduling interviews vs I wouldn't have put the same effort if I had a job because my job was draining and I was the only person on-call for outages.\n\n**Was finding the second job easier?** \n\numm ... It was more fun? You have more experience so you can't play the new-grad-doesn't-have-any-experience card anymore. People expect you to know some stuff. But it was more fun because of that. The response rate was much higher than when I was a new grad because of my resume. \n\nI know you like stats so there's more:\n\n**In the span of two months:**\n\n* Jobs applied : 43\n* Call backs : 20\n* Outright rejected with an email: 11 \n* Offers : 2 (I might get another one if I continue with interview process but I'm happy with my current offer so I won't) \n\n\nHope you find this post helpful and I'm open to answer your questions. Thanks to this sub for keeping me motivated during my interview process. I will continue to lurk around and help out if I can.\n\n\n\n\n**EDIT: Hey all -- this post got a lot of attention. I'm trying my best to respond to everyone and the DMs as fast as I can** ",

I started at my current job last year and along the way learned more Python knowledge as well as a substantial knowledge using many different AWS services. I was grossly underpaid but I knew it was because I didn't go to college for CS and had little to no experience. Last month I decided to go out and search for a new job and found one, passed all the tests, whiteboard etc.. They made a substantial offer and when I told my current job about it, they made a counter-offer matching it. So now I am at a cross-roads. Do I stay, do I go? Maybe some of you can share your experiences in similar situations.\n\nA little more info to help you guys give good advice.\n\n1) Both companies are start-ups, my current company is ~4 years old, the new one is ~2 years old\n\n2) The newer company is smaller \n\n3) The newer company is in Jersey but the commute time isn't that much longer\n\n4) The newer company has all their devs in office while my current company everyone is pretty much remote\n\nThanks, fellas!",

I took up the degree to get better jobs, but during my summer job hunt this year, I've had few responses and was wondering if it might be my portfolio.\n\nOn job applications, I send them my website. The site started off as a pure portfolio for recruiters, but I've since developed it into a bit of an advertisement for my freelance services, complete with pricing, FAQs and a contact form for sending a brief over to me.\n\nAt first I thought it would be a great practical opportunity to flex my muscles for job applications. I thought that recruiters and companies would appreciate proof of initiative and industry knowledge, but a couple of application responses made me feel as though some companies think I won't put my heart in if I've already got freelancing as a back up plan, or that they might think I might just up and leave at any point or something.\n\nI was actually thinking of going further on the website, and setting up Stripe to accept payments and a simple CRM to allow clients to contact me, provide assets and check on a project's progress.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this? Would something like that come off as a negative or a positive on job applications?\n\nAny advice appreciated!\n\nEdit: Thanks for your comments everyone.

The 1 month gig was a job at a game studio, I thought this was something that would get me excited about work, as I've never worked on games before, but I found out before long that it wasn't for me. At each of my jobs, I've excelled and been able to contribute significantly, such that by the time I leave, I'm the person everyone asks questions to. Unfortunately I always end up hating my job and leaving. Part of the problem is that I always find myself working under a lead that's been there for a long time, and therefore gets to dictate the terms of everything I work on (code style, design, etc.) even though I always feel that I've demonstrated my competence and ability time and again. This gets me depressed and hating my job as I feel a total lack of ownership on the items I'm working on. I'm starting to think that I have a problem with authority and/or am a total control freak, and I'm unsure what to do next.\n\nNow, I've started a job at one of the big 3 and have received a great package and pay, but half a year in, I feel I have the same dilemma again, with the same type of tech lead and the same feelings on not having any ownership on what I work on (although this time to make things worse, there's an added layer of bureaucracy on top). I've exceeded expectation so far, and this time I'm definitely going to stay for the full year to get my vested stocks, but once again I see myself leaving. When I've brought up my thoughts to my manager, he assures me that things will be better, that I should stay patient and pay my dues. I'm not sure I have it in me.\n\nAnyone ever feel this way or have any advice?\n\nThanks for reading!\n",

These were both Android gigs, which is what I'd really like to be doing with my career, but I am open to other stuff at this time. Company A is not an Android role.\n\nWhen I got the chance to interview with B, and C I knew it would take some time. Company A wanted me to come in within a week or two and I knew the process with B and C would be much longer than that since there were take-home assignments involved and the like. \n\nSo I got on the the phone with the recruiter from Company A and told her something along the lines of \"I have to be totally open and honest with you, I have the chance to pursue some Android roles which, if I'm being totally honest with myself, is what I want to be doing. I'm sorry, but I will not be able to come in for the interview, Company A sounds great and it seems like an interesting role, but I just need to see these other opportunities through.\"\n\nShe was totally understanding, to my surprise. She said that if things don't work out to give a call back because they are always looking for good engineers.\n\nSo now that companies B and C haven't worked out I'm going to give her a call. I guess I'm just looking for some advice. Has anyone done something like this? I feel like from Company A's point of view they'd be like \"well if these other companies didn't hire him why would we want him?\". \n\nI know the only thing I can do here is try, but I'm just wondering if there might be some good way to approach this conversation. Maybe something more like \"well, it turned out that company B and C just weren't the right fit\", rather than straight up admitting I didn't get the jobs.\n\nAny advice is appreciated!\n\n(Also, none of these companies are Big-N types)",

I finally got a job interview for a job I would say is my dream.job starting out as a Public Health Nutritionist. I felt the interview went well and I felt connected to the 3 panel interview. It's a government job so they said because of all the (pretty much red tape) it would take 3 weeks to hear back. The only word I got was when I called and left a voicemail the next day about a question and he returned my call right away. Since most jobs I've interviewed with are dead silent until they make a decision I though that was a good sign. \n\nI emailed them today to follow up since it's been 3 weeks to see where there were on making a decision. I heard nothing back. Then about 3 hours ago I saw they reposted the job. I'm crushed. I really wanted this job. Does this mean that they didn't like any of the candidates and are looking again? It's a government job so I wasn't sure if it's some kind of protocol. But either way I'm bummed. Does anyone have any kind of experience such as this? Should I call it a lost cause? ",

They don't do code reviews.  They say they are afraid to work on their part of the project because they don't understand it, but lie to my superior when asked.  They don't complete assignment, simple things that might take an hour.  I could go on.\n\nSo I sucked it up and started working over time, for months, to get past their short comings and keep my project afloat.  But, it's killing me slowly and the team mates only hate me for trying to improve their code.  And of course, they still make the same mistakes that take days for me to repair.  What's more, they've complained to my boss about me \"demanding code reviews before commits\".  My boss actually put me on a pip for it.\n\nEvery job I've worked, the most senior dev is usually lead and has final say about everything.  But my boss is now telling me that the junior devs \"dont need review\" because it will hurt their morale.  This seems strange, and I was curious if anyone had experience this kind of experience.  Also, I'm at a loss on how to move forward and want some advice.  My current focus is finding new work (which isn't difficult) but I hate to leave behind such a lucrative contract.",

So from that perspective they are somewhat competitive here.\n\n* They are also much more competitive at the highest levels (Principal and above).  \n\n* However, Amazon and MS salaries are really low (relative to their peers) in the mid-levels (senior engineers).  \n\nI'm surprised because these two are always grouped in the \"Big 4\".  But they are not competitive at the senior levels.  The total comp is actually not even impressive compared to rest of industry compensation at other non-tech companies.  I was also surprised by the really high compensation from LinkedIn and Twitter which are not in the \"Big 4\".  Maybe \"Big 4\" should be renamed \"Big SV\"?  It seems that's a more accurate label because the common factor with Amazon and MS is that they're both based in Seattle.    Is the data in this blog post still accurate?\n\nAs a senior engineer, I'm just going to completely ignore these two companies.  Why would I go through their shitty interview process (the usual algorithm/DS hazing process) to get total comp that's barely above what I can get at any other company?  And in addition, Amazon has a reputation for really bad working conditions.  It's like these two companies don't care at all about retaining or getting senior engineers.  ",

I have no problem with learning new tech but this project gets very little attention. At first I was collaborating with a few people but they have all been pulled away on other things and its just me now, and this project is a seriously huge undertaking (scoped out for a year). I am amazed that they would put a recent grad on something so complex, honestly, as I doubt most of my fellow graduates would have handled this well (I have a knack for complexity).\n\nAnyway, this project is to the point where my innate coding skills are no longer enough to keep it going, and I am sick of having zero mentorship or collaboration. I seriously wonder if my presence is even noticed sometimes. I get zero feedback on the thousands of lines of code I have produced. I have no idea if I am doing it right, and it doesnt seem like anyone even cares. This project/ system I am building is supposed to be used early next year, so I get that people have more immediate concerns with the current product, but I seriously get brushed off, ignored, and pushed aside constantly. \n\nI have asked for someone else to be put on the project. Didnt happen. I have asked for more face time with superiors. not happening.\n\nIt is to the point now that I am so bored/ frustrated that I want to quit, but that would look really bad on my resume since I have been here just 4 months and my last job was 8 months.\n\nHow do I cope?\n\n\n\n",

            "selftext": "Hello.\n\nI have been working in the industry for about 2 years as a .NET developer in three different companies. During this time I came across problems and issues that caused me a lot of pain and which I believe could have been avoided. However, it seems I lack knowledge and/or skill required to do so (or maybe I'm just too trusting or naive). Either way, it has been bothering me for a while and I just can't quite figure it out myself.\n\nTo shed some light on my thought process I need to describe what I came across in every company I've been working for. Skip the next three paragrahps if you're not interested.\n\n____________________________\n\nFirst job: adverised as a \"C#/[name of a 3rd party software] developer\". I'm not mentioning the exact name since I don't want to be identifed. During the interview they told me that I'll be a C# developer and that \"some\" projects use Visual Basic. Turns out that every time I have to write code is in Visual Basic. On top of that everything I did amounted to nothing more than mainenance. Naturally I wanted out - I got myself an interview with an another company, they (I think?) figured it out told me that soon I will switch teams to a one that does only .NET and that I will never have to touch VB6 ever again. I was so happy! Two months later they hired a guy for that team. When I brought that up and asked why him instead of me all I got was \"we hired an another person\" (no shit) and that \"there's no more room in that team for a one more guy\". Since we had an open space I kept hearing how the other team talks about architecture, different problems they encountered and solutions to them and how they're gonna integrate X with Y. They seemed to have a lot of fun doing this. I didn't have fun.\n\nSecond job: this time .NET exclusively, through a company that did oursourcing (quite popular in Eastern Europe). I was hired as a junior along with a senior developer. The senior developer was amazing - he was very motivated and very skilled. We had a talk with the client - apparently they had lots of different systems, but we were supposed to set up one from scratch. The senior developer told me to not worry about anything and that he can mentor me, as long as I'm willing to learn. I was so happy! A few weeks later we got the project specification, one more guy joined our team... and the PM decided I won't be a part of the new project. Instead I got redelegated to fixing a mess that has reached the production system and really pissed off the client. Said programmers still worked at the company (they were worrking inhouse), expect they had new, shiny project and no longer contributed to the unfinished mess. I was told they were ready to provide me with everything I needed, but more than ofter it took a day to get any response from them. Said mess was a REST API that pulled data from the database through a custom made ORM - the code was horrible (I kid you not, I found something very similar to [this](https://thedailywtf.com/articles/What_Is_Truth_0x3f_) in the code - said example is no longer funny for me). The PM expected me to fix everything ASAP and coordinate stuff with a completely different team in Vietnam (they barely spoke English and didn't care anymore because their contract with the company was expiring anyway). I was a part of the team, but the team worked on a new stuff and I worked on the old bugs, so I was pretty much alone against a PM that expected I will do his job, a team that didn't give a fuck anymore and a deadline that was changed from two months to three weeks. And again, the guy sitting next to me had a lot of fun. I didn't. I was getting increasignly depressed because I took a pay cut to be there and it was getting about as bad as the old job. I put in my two weeks notice as soon as I got an another opportunity. The only \"fun\" I had at that job was knowing that I leave right before the deadline, that they have no way of forcing me to stay longer and that they're stuck with the mess they themselves caused. \n\nCurrent job: .NET developer yet again. It's my first month. I just found out that the project I'll be working on - one of the \"most important\" in \nthe company... has the entire logic layer contained in the database as stored procedures. Apparently it used to make sense once (how?!). This means \nthat in 2017 I will not have a luxury of using a debugger. I was also given promises that I'll be able to work on a more exciting stuff in a few \nmonths - I feel very reluctant in believing them. At least here I can wipe my tears with money (almost 2x as much as I made in the previous job).\n\n____________________________\n\nI want to know how can I avoid working on projects that are primarily mainenance of stuff that no one else wants to work on. None of these companies had negative Glassdoor reviews -  in all cases there were no reviews at all. Even though these companies are shitty there are people in there who doesn't bathe in the sea of old code and people who get to work on new projects. They aren't facing the problems I've faced. In fact, I have been working for 2 years now and I've never had a joy of working on a project from start to finish. I'm afraid this will hurt my future job prospects and pigeonhole me towards maintenance programming forever.\n\nMy questions are:\n\n* How can I work on new projects instead of maintaing old codebases? Should I just learn a newer language like [insert current fad] and try to get employed in a company that uses it? I'm not convinced if it's worth the effort - the job offers are rare for things like these and there are people who doesn't have to go this route in order to work on a new stuff. A US-centric answer would be \"join a startup\", but here there's not that many startups on the market and these are looking for people better than me anyway.\n\n* Is it just a skill gap? Am I just not experienced enough? The only way I can learn is to work on my own and try to do my best even on munduane problems. I'm not learning much on the job because I end up fixing someone else's stuff instead. I have a desire to learn, but it's quite hard to put in additional hours of learning after working for 8 hours on mind-numbingly boring stuff. It doesn't seem to be as effective as learning stuff on the job.\n\n* How come I never seem to work with people that I can truly learn from? Am I just that unlucky?\n\n* What can I do to avoid running into projects like these before I get hired? Am I just not asking the right questions during the interviews? I usually ask about .NET framework version and how old the codebase is, but that didn't help me detect problems so far because the other side can just lie by ommision.\n\nAny input is appreciated.",

I'd like to pursue a PhD, or another master, or both.\n\nThe problem is, I get extremely anxious when looking for masters in the US, to the point of feeling physically sick. This is why:  \n\n* My peers consider my curriculum great, but I'm really scared about comparing myself to the rest of the world because of the diverse education system of my country. For example, here is not common at all to work while studying, and our education is very focused on theory rather than practice. It's very uncommon for students to work or apply to internships while studying, as focusing on just studying is much more encouraged. This is why it looks like my curriculum stands out among my peers, but I don't feel that this applies worldwide because I see that in every other country everybody has already interned at some great company long before graduating.\n* Speaking about this, I have no internships, apart from Google Summer of Code (but Google states that that's not to be considered an internship). \n* Although I did very very good during the master, my bachelor's didn't go as well and my marks are average. If I apply now, since my MSc will become official in January, I fear that they'll pay more attention to my bachelor's marks and not the current ones.\n\nThis process is so stressful to me, I am constantly looking at requirements for getting into programs and even the advice articles I find crush my soul, I am constantly questioning if I am good enough or not. Every time I see the curriculum of somebody else with a success story of getting in a prestigious program, I get depressed.\n\nPlease, please, please, this stress is killing me, give me some perspective (:\nThank you so much!\n\nEdit: formatting  \nEdit: I'm also open to suggestions like \"A second MSc is a waste of time\"",

Firstly let me say that I am already looking for a new position but until those lines being cast actually bring something up, i'm not going to hold my breath.\n\nI was hired on in December of 16 under the agreed upon expectation that I would take on new responsibilities and learn the job that's the second part of my job title. That was great and I was excited for it but it is Month 9 and I'm doing data entry. I specifically asked when I was interviewing if this part of my job was data entry and was told no.\n\nHalfway through month 7, i heard through the grapevine about this new internal position and approached my direct manager about it. We had a meeting not long after where she told me she discussed it with the boss and they felt I didn't have the experience yet. That was fair and I took the opportunity to briefly discuss my frustrations and desires to go to the Policy Administration side of my job (that isnt data entry) because I want to learn, etc. she said she would talk to the claims manager about pulling me from there.\n\nI wanted to get into Policy Admin. This is part of what I was hired for that actually expands my skill set. Since that meeting? I have been removed from a monthly client phone call to focus on data entry (even though in my annual review two months in I was told to do phone calls). I have now been told it is not necessary for me to attend the Underwriting meetings, and now today our new employee was introduced for that job I applied for, but then heard my boss introduce the new employee to three other people as \"also assisting on Policy Admin duties\". I know this wasnt a mistake because she told this to the three other people before getting to me and then all after me.\n\nAfter that, i get an email that our RECEPTIONIST will be attending the underwriter meetings and could I cover for her.\n\nI have no clue whats going on at this point. I am trying to find a new job but jobs are tough. I need the money but I am afraid of the harm this is going to do to me and I don't know how much unemployment I can get out of this.\n\nAny advice is appreciated.\n\nLocated in NE ohio",

            "selftext": "I have just started an advanced diploma program in Software Development at a college in Ontario (Americans, think community college).\n\nI already have a BSc and an MSc in a scientific but unrelated field. I fell out of love with my field in grad school - I realized I didn't want to teach or do research, which are really the only options available for what I was doing.\n\nI'm concerned about both the quality of the education I'm going to get in this college program as well as my career prospects. It's been a big culture shock so far - I am used to being surrounded by older, motivated academics, I guess, and now I'm surrounded by fresh high school students.\n\nI took this program for 4 reasons in particular: \n\n1. It's close to my house.\n\n2. Co-op.\n\n3. It's only 3 years vs. 5 years for co-op at, say, uWaterloo.\n\n4. Not sure I could hack all the math at UW for example.\n\nI intend to teach myself Python alongside the Java this program teaches, but I'm really getting the sense from reading this sub that understanding algorithms, data structures, etc, as well as networking (the human kind) are critical to aceing interviews. I don't know what kind of network I'll be able to build here, and this program does not have courses explicitly on algorithms or data structures, higher math beyond basic calculus, etc.\n\nThis program does have a high placement rate for co-op (85-100% depending on whether it's your first vs. second or third co-op) with salaries averaging $18/hr (not the best, I know). It also has a decent field-related employment rate (~80% 6 months after grad, salary range 35k - 60k). I wonder how, however, as the courses don't seem particularly in-depth. I'm also concerned they might be including things like help-desk IT as \"field-related\" even though this is for Software Development.\n\nI'm looking to break into the software industry in the KW area but I know that will put me up against UW, UoG, WLU, and Conestoga College grads who want to stay in the area.\n\nAm I shooting myself in the foot by doing college vs. a second Bachelor's? Is there anything else I can do to level the playing field vs. Comp Sci grads?",

I want to do better this year, but I'm a 19 year old kid who knows almost nothing. Help.**\n\n**About**\n---\n\nI'm a second year CS student at a decent university in the UK (decent as in not oxbridge and not London). I've been working as a developer for 3-4 years now, paying my living costs by doing it part time while studying. Even won a big Google thing a few years back.\n\n\n**Last year's blunder**\n--\n\nTherefore, when applying for an internship last year I thought getting in would be a breeze. *It was not*. I applied to ~20-30 places that I would've liked to intern at (not only big 4, but also 'smaller' guys such as airbnb, yelp, bloomberg, mailchimp, ebay, etc.).\n\nI got 0 offers and 0 interviews. To be frank, I'm quite sure I only got about 8 rejection e-mails and nothing else. This came as a pretty big surprise for me, as peers with objectively less experience and knowledge got offers before Christmas. I even talked to a friend at Google and told me he could submit my resume so that it would pass the first few cuts. Google rejected me after 6 months of silence. \n\nAlmost a year later, I'm still unsure of what my enormous mistake that caused all this was. My linkedin is flooded with offers on a daily basis, and finding work as a contractor takes me 2-3 days inbetween projects. \n\n**New hope?**\n--\n\nI want this year to go better. I need this year to go better. I've started catching up on LeetCode while working on my resume and portfolio. The thing is, I've not got an interview yet. Working on LeetCode only helps if I nail that bit first. [This is my resume](http://i.imgur.com/2vlOvH6.png) and [this is my portfolio](http://www.tannousmarc.com). If there's anything you dislike on either of those, I'd be more than happy to hear it out.\n\n- Is my first impression (resume/portfolio) unpleasant? \n- Should I apply to more companies? There are not a lot of big ones in the UK and I'm not sure people in the US would give me a chance at this point.\n- Aside from working on LeetCode and my resume/portfolio, what can I do to better myself?",

            "selftext": "So I was stoked to get an internship at a Fortune 500 company this summer. The campus is great and we have free snacks and a gym. However, they didn't have a project established for me to tackle starting off. They basically ignored me unless I prompted discussion my first 2 weeks. My assigned mentor is in the east coast office so communication is always done through Skype and Slack. \n\nMy mentor said he had 3 projects in mind. 1 was an AR project, another was to create libraries to make their SDK compatible with a hybrid framework, and another was Android Instant Apps. They decided that instant apps weren't fulfilling any of their business goals even though the tech is cool and AR was at the bottom of my interests, so that left the other project as my last option. I went with that and then few weeks into the project realize that the SDK team is entirely in east coast as well. If I needed help understanding something, I would have to communicate via Slack and very occasionally schedule screen sharing meetings to do walkthroughs. So this slows down my productivity considerably when the only people relevant to my project are out of the office by 2pm. \n\nOn top of all this, the hybrid framework feels a bit buggy and I constantly run into unexpected errors when trying to build my app. I was able to develop a library and create an app to show that the native Android API method calls are being executed by the hybrid app. Once I finished part 1, the library files I imported for part 2 were not being packaged properly by the hybrid framework despite there not being issues on native Android. So my mentor tells me to switch to creating the libraries using iOS version of their SDK. iOS was much more challenging to deal with and I had to rely on someone to add me to the iOS development group to get the full paid developer privileges. Then the certificates had issues, which required me to try to resolve it on my own before contacting the admin, who created new ones that finally worked. Finally, here I am on my last week, barely scratching the surface of their SDK for Android and not being able to resolve all the quirks that came with the hybrid framework on time along with the slow communication with employees in other locations. I feel like I didn't give my 100% even though it also seems like I did whatever I could with the resources I was given. \n\nAnother intern from last summer who joined as full-time had told me that he used the same framework but with Bluetooth hardware and told me that he noticed unexpected behaviors, rendering that framework unusable for production. On the bright side, I was making $30/hr and did enough to make it look appealing on my resume. ",

The Python dictionary is a VERY, VERY useful weapon.  **Why not Python?**  I don't know how to do OOP in Python.  Don't know how to implement trees and linked lists in Python.\n\n**Why Java?** I do know how to implement trees using this language.  I do know how to implement linked lists using this language.  **Why not Java?** Clunkier, more overhead to set things up in the code, I have never used a HashMap in my life (compare that to my knowing how to use the powerful Python dictionary).\n\nFor now:  Java for trees/linkedList problems, Python for string processing and graph problems (adjacency list is what I use) and anything needing a hash.  What if it's a tree problem that also needs a hash?  Well, then need to figure out which language has the holes that are easiest to patch up for me.\n\nThanks in advance!",

The company I'm at deals with computer security itself but I'm working as a generic developer on a web application.

My initial plan was to work at this company for 1-2 years while building up computer security knowledge (Certifications, bug bounties, projects etc.) and eventually move into an Application Security position (or intrusion response, security analyst or what have you). \n\nI understand that the skills I learn as a junior developer are not immediately transferable to all security positions but I feel that they would at least be useful for an application security position and at least tangentially helpful for other positions. \n\nDoes my plan sound feasible?

            "selftext": "Hey guys,\n\nI have been fighting to carve out a new position for myself at my company and just won the battle. Now I am being asked what I want my title to be and honestly I am drawing a blank as to what the proper title is. I was hoping you could give me some ideas or feedback based on what you have seen.\n\n**Where do I work?**\n\nI work for one of the most well known tech companies in the valley. We are in the news daily, have a share price over $300, and we are about 30k people globally.\n\n**What department do I work in?**\n\nI work under the IT umbrella. There are 3 people in between me and the CEO, 2 for CIO. People that I know who are in the same department are Desktop Engineers, HelpDesk Techs, SysAdmins, etc.\n\n**What is my background?**\n\nI studied CSE at a four-year. I have a BS is Computer Engineering, a minor in math, yada yada...\nI took a job here working in IT as an intern for the company name and have been bounced around between titles here and there because none of them matched the work that I do, thus why I am getting a new one.\n\n**What do I do?**\n\nI do a bit of everything honestly, specialization is not a luxury I can afford. \nIf the current method of resetting passwords sucks, my team builds the new method. That means standing up the VMs, configuring the webserver and Jenkins, writing the test cases, setting the DB schema, writing the API, the front end, everything. I lean on the SysAdmins for some things but we do mostly everything.\n\nI write website and APIs in Python, native applications in C#, IT automation in PowerShell. I configure my own servers and manage them, I configure my won CI pipeline, etc.\n\n**Which titles have I considered?**\n\nDevOps Engineer is too narrow for my scope\n\nSoftware Engineer is non descriptive\n\nClient Platform Engineer is more related to IT management (SCCM, JAMF, AirWatch)\n\nPlatform Software Engineer is more about middleware and usability, not actual applications\n\nFull Stack Developer is a bit of overkill IMO\n\n\nI need a title that conveys the fact that this role does a bit of everything. In general the job description is: Solve critical business needs by making systems talk to each other in the proper fashion using automation, or create a brand new system which solves the problem. I am **not** Product facing. Everything I build is an internal application.\n\nAny Feedback is appreciated! I asked to have until Monday. If I can't come up with something better we are just going to move forward with 'Software Engineer'",

Its not great pay but it's plenty for me. There are quite a few perks I enjoy as well, such as: working form home, benefits, etc. However, the company is going through a transformation and will be outsourcing a lot of IT work. This is due to leaderships terrible decisions to not keep up with technology. This is the beginning of my problems. \n \nBasically my experience here has been hit or miss. I have learned a lot but I also feel as though I've not learned enough. I have worked with very old and POORLY written applications (asp.net, VB6). So I feel most of that experience was nearly worthless. However, my senior bless his soul, fought to update an older application. He pulled me into the project and I feel like I started to finally grow as a developer. I've got to have my hands in technologies such as: C#, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, AngularJS, MVC. A bit of back end and front end work. \n \nWith this transformation I could be at worst left without a job within a couple years or pigeon holed into working with ServiceNow which I KNOW i do not want to be doing. \n \nI've been applying like crazy but I feel I have experience with multiple tools but not necessarily a master of any. \n \nAll my work I can't share with future employers because I do not own this code. What do you guys think I should do to increase my chances in finding a better opportunity? I'm casting wide nets across the US but I barely meet minimum requirements for even Junior or entry level postings let alone mid-level. Thanks in advance.",

I initially wanted to do CS, but I got talked out of it by the CS director at my school. So I studied business instead, but that just made me appreciate the value of CS even more.  \n\nI technically should be graduating this semester with my business degree, but I'm extending my graduation to least 3 more semester to complete more CS course work since I'd rather have a CS career or a CS career where I can apply some of my business background.  I missed last year's fall recruitment season and then failed to lock down the outlier employers that were still accepting applications in the spring. So I still don't have any internship/work experience to show, despite being ready to graduate. Since I'm staying another 3 semesters, I get one more summer internship opportunity, but I'm having a hard time finding CS related positions I'm actually qualified for with my limited Cs course work. \n\nSo far, I've taken 1 introductory programming class since I had no prior experience. I learned basic programming with python, (simple data structures, loops, functions, some frameworks, but nothing too advanced.)\n\nSecond class I took was OOP with java. Covered things like different data types, variables, expressions, assignment, methods, javadoc documentation, parameters, iteration, selection, recursion, generic linear data structures and maps, exception handling, file types, file I/O, simple GUIs, programming to an interface and use of inheritance, introduction to Java threads. I was overloaded with my business classes last semester, so I didn't practice enough with programming. I'm now pretty rusty and forgot a bulk of what I learned in this class. I'm trying to do a side project with Java spring right now to get more practice, but I think I need to re-teach myself this class since I have gaps. \n\nI went to a couple hackathons and did some things in HTML/CSS. HTML seemed basic, but CSS gave me some trouble. I don't have the creative eye to make things look pretty.\n\nThe third class I just started, so not really applicable. Machine Organization. So far, we've learned binary/hexadecimal, logic gates, boolean algebra, and other stuff. I think we'll be building some hardware and learning C. \n\nNext semester, I'm planning on taking the more advanced portion of my current class, in addition to data structures and algorithms.\n\n\nBy the end of next semester, I think I'll be ready, or at least be minimally qualified enough for some of these positions, but I'm not exactly sure what to do right now since recruitment is now. I don't think I'll be able to pass a technical interview at the moment, nor do I possess qualifications. \n\nWith that all being said, I'm pretty lost.

After my contract not being renewed back in February I've had a lot of interviews but still, rejection after rejection. This has left me pretty damn discouraged, and I'm looking at potentially making a change to web development.\n\nI'm very strong with the \"infrastructure\" side of things and have a decent background in system analysis/design (my capstone project for my bachelors was lauded and we almost went into business with it). I had a software development internship back in 2014 that I left to go into I.T. for, largely because I felt useless and the tech was ollllllld (VB6).\n\nMy question is, is this a realistic goal? Is my background potentially a positive, or is it almost universally seen as a negative for potential webdev managers/owners? I'm thinking of starting out learning JavaScript and Python (am already pretty familiar with them, did my share of scripting in the past). Is the pay comparable or better than in I.T.? Job outlook better? I get the sense that I would have access to more interesting and diverse work than I would have setting up vmware or router configs, but I want to be sure. And the potential for meaningful side work is exciting.\n\nIn my city there is a program called launchcode that will pair you with an established company after you pass a certain baseline of coding aptitude. I intend to go for that to cover my lack of experience since my internship.\n\nAnyway, I'm still pretty early in my search into this, but it seems exciting in its possibilities.

            "selftext": "Hey guys!\n\nI just graduated pretty recently with a master's and I'm in the process of interviewing with a couple of companies.\n\nI have pretty much been preparing all summer for the interviews in CS, ML and mobile. I've primarily been using Cracking the Code Interview, Hackerrank and Leetcode for coding and coding under pressure.\n\nI usually code up a problem without compiling, and then running it, probably get some error, and then reiterate until I'm done. Then I check similar solutions and try to understand how those work. When I feel like I've found a pattern/behaviour (ie way to solve a problem) that I feel is the most natural (and will remember the easiest) I turn to my whiteboard and do it on there from scratch while talking to myself out loud.\n\nI have a few problems though. This shit is getting pretty boring. I honestly don't think it's \"super fun\" to reverse a linked list or invert a binary tree, I just want to be working on a project, optimize the heck out of it when I need to and write clean code with cool peeps around me. \n\nI've done a couple of interviews, but it seems like I choke the f up when I do phone interviews. I got a tree-based question once and just sat there for 20 minutes reiterating the same thing over and over again and erased the same line. Of course that was a nah. It's funny, because this doesn't happen IRL. I excel at system design, testing and concepts, but whenever the question is altered so I feel like I haven't heard it, I kinda go into a bad loop and get paralyzed by it.\n\nAlso, I've pretty much gone through CTCI three times but I still forget a bunch of questions. What can I do? Should I just keep on doing problems or is there a better way here? I just want to be at a cool company where I can show what I'm worth. All advice is appreciated.",

How do I gain a sense of my career standings given that my situation greatly differs from this norm? And what's my best course of action to further my career?\n\nMy background:\n\n1.   Only have a career certificate from the local community college. Essentially mimics the AAS counterpart (the credits from the cert apply to the degree), sans gen-ed classes. Very detailed on practical/applied CS, from database design and querying to fundamental programming skills, with a later focus on advanced OOP practices and back-end/server-side development. Not much focus on theory. Only one module of one class was spent on Big-O and search/sorting algos. Another module only somewhat covered DS.\n2.   Low cost of living city with low number of tech companies. You can get a studio aptmt in the city for about $750-850/mo\n\n3.    I've been at my first company (small non-tech, not-for-profit) for 15 months now, currently doing mostly business intelligence type stuff, with occasional development work in small projects. Recent raise and promotion brought me to 40k base salary, though I was and still am hourly non-exempt. Standard 401k matching of 50% of 6% of salary, 20 days PTO/sick days year, a pension plan, and $225/mo from employer for my HSA. Bonuses average about 1.5k a year. \n\n    A more development oriented type job is my goal, and my role at the company will soon evolve to that. Question is, should I wait for that, or try to see if I can land a better position elsewhere? Given my foothold into the career, should I even bother with completing the 2-year degree, and then perhaps transfer (transfer rules are favorable) for a BS? Given where I live, is my best option to relocate to a better city?",

I have nearly 3 years of dev experience, but I graduated with my Bachelors in Information Systems last year. The interview was for a general Software Engineer position.\n\nFirst interview was over phone. I was asked increasingly harder questions about OOP, recursion, multi-threading, and finally a question about how many times an array would need to be accessed when searching for a value.\n\nMy second interview was over skype, where I shared my screen and wrote code out in a text editor after they verbally asked the questions. I was asked the following questions:\n\n1. Create a function to determine whether a not a string is a substring anagram of another string. (ex: doggone, god)\n\n2. Create a function that returns the factorial of the number being passed in.\n\n3. Fizz Buzz\n\n4. Create a function that determines if a value exists in a binary search tree.\n\nI haven't received an offer, but I do expect one based on the positive feedback from my interviewers. I'm happy to answer any questions as long as it doesn't involve specifics about the company. Hopefully this is some useful information for those not trying for Big 4 style companies.",

As a math major, I took courses up to and including proof-based algebra and analysis. I also did two software engineering internships for startups along with some work with a math faculty member (one applied math paper that we are preparing for publication).\n\nThis past summer, I had planned to work remotely (unpaid; no application, just emailed them) under a researcher at a lab; however, my plans fizzled out as I realized my limited experience in the field wouldn't be enough to get anything done in one summer. I stopped communicating with my \"advisor\" (as I never heard back from them and I didn't have any progress to report on my project); however, I found an open-source project from a researcher in the same lab that I became very interested in and started contributing to quite a bit. The work was mainly software engineering (the project has a solid codebase and strict coding guidelines, etc. so I had to write tests as well; very similar to what you might see at an internship with a company). I also collaborated with others working on the project. The programming also required a lot of knowledge in the research area.\n\nI would like to apply to more well-known companies this year (Big 4, well-established companies like Airbnb, Stripe, etc.). How can I present my work from the past summer in a way that will place my application in the \"granted an interview\" pile without lying and/or stretching the truth?\n\nI guess my main question is, can I call my work an internship and put it under job experience?

I've gone through the phone screening process and am scheduled to be onsite for a 5 hour interview process next Monday.  I'm trying to gauge whether it's worth it or not.  Does anyone have any insight?  \n  \nAdditionally, and getting ahead of myself here, but in preliminary discussions, it sounds like at best I can expect a salary in line with what I make now, but I currently work from home since my commute \"downtown\" will take, at best, 1h 15m and most days probably more.  There is little opportunity for telecommuting in this role and it would cause some childcare issues which will require an additional expense.  At the same time, this is \"high tech\" and would look great on my resume.  Plus, it's working on something that I truly feel could be one of the next big things and vastly change so many facets of our economy (not necessarily for the better -- i.e. truck and taxi drivers).  \n  \nI know I'm rambling and I apologize.  I'm just so conflicted because while I think this would be awesome, I also don't know if I can justify it because of lack of pay increase, unknown stock options, longer working hours, longer commute....  \n\n  \n  \n- For some background, I have been working for 12.5 years, but not for a \"tech\" company like Uber.  \n  \n- I've been in IT in the Insurance industry (both health and life/annuity).   Currently in the health insurance industry so given the political landscape, things are always changing and my company is currently doing random layoffs.  Who knows if I'll end up impacted or not.   \n  \n- My degree is in Information Systems, but my program had significant programming courses (same as the CS program).  I can read code and understand what's going on, but have not been asked to code in a professional capacity (other than VBA scripting in Excel which I hesitate to even call coding).\n  \n- My career has been in the Business / Systems Analysis realm, but I also have experience as a Project Lead and as a people manager (of a team of Business/Systems Analysts).  \n",

Questionable leadership decisions, team members that struggle through the simplest problems/not motivated to do good work (which ends up looking bad on me), and uninteresting work are a few complaints. Current total compensation per year is $240k-250k.\n\nI received an offer at a company rumored to be IPOing in the next few months.\n\nOffer: $165k salary, $15k sign on bonus, $150k worth of stock options, share # is set and strike price seems to be about 10% below rumored value. (I also will pull in $15k in PTO time if I leave current role).\n\nAccording to my calculations, my break even point year one is if the stock price doubles (thanks to sign on/PTO payout). From then on, my break even point is if the stock price triples over the next three years, netting me $300k total profit (75k/year over 4 years) in addition to the $165k base. Definitely would be betting on this company majorly, and I do believe in the company-- just is tough to take that big of a cut. \n\nThe startup refuses to give any additional information to help me evaluate the stock offering. I love the work, culture, and team that I met, but I'm trying to justify taking what seems to be such a deep pay cut ($40k year one, $75k years 2,3,4). Obviously my future jobs would be affected by my current compensation so it's a big decision.\nCan I get some advice on what to do? Does their offer seem fair?",

Sometimes I feel sky high, on paper my career is going great, but in reality I feel like I can't keep up and as if I simply don't have the right state of mind to really progress in this job.\n\nI have had low points before, very stressful weeks where I'm kept awake all night worrying about my job and career as a whole. Those days were mostly at the start of my career, it's all come flooding back recently though.\n\nI recently got moved onto this project as people left the company, previously it was one senior looking after maintenance of this project. He's gone and now I'm in charge, I'm only mid-level but I should be able to maintain this project. At first I was annoyed at the PM for expecting me to be at the same level of knowledge on this project as the guy who built it from the ground up, 2 weeks and a few delays in and I'm realising I'm most likely the problem. The PM is very nice, but I find myself biting my tongue and holding myself back from snapping when he looks bemused as to why something may take longer. I want to say, A. I'm not a senior, and B. I didn't make this app and I'm not going to get up to speed immediately.\n\nI think it boils down to expectations. I have a degree in CS from a top 10 uni, before graduation I worked as a research assistant and had a web dev job too. I got a promotion 9 months into my graduate job, at a company known for hiring the best (I was working with Cambridge, Harvard, and Imperial grads). Thing is, I went to university 2 years late because I didn't do very well in school, and miraculously got top grades when I resat my final 2 years. Uni was hard for me. I did get a promotion at a known company, but I was friends with my manager and the team I was on wasn't the best, so it's nowhere near as good as it looks.\n\nI have trouble with managing many moving parts, I get build configurations wrong, I break down under stress. Honestly I feel like a junior, but people are expecting me to be a senior, worst of all I'm getting paid like a senior, so I have nothing to fall back on and I seriously regret pushing salary negotiations as hard as I did.\n\nI feel like my knowledge is there, I write Medium articles that get 1000s of claps, I can talk for days about coding, but actual problem solving takes me longer than my peers, and I am just the worst at multi-tasking.\n\nI've been contacted by MS and Palantir, but I had to tell them I'm not looking because I know a company like that would break me.\n\nWill these feelings go away? Will I learn to learn, and problem solve faster? I feel like while my knowledge is improving quickly, my actual hard skills just aren't keeping up. It makes me think I just don't have the mental capacity to ever make it to senior and beyond.\n\nHelp?",

            "selftext": "After being at my current job for sometime, I realize It is quickly becoming a dead end. This is my first job out of college. When I first started, I didn't have as much technical knowledge as the senior developers. The company said that as time passes, I would be gradually taught more. During that time, I would be given some business and IT tasks. I was given a below market salary for my degree (Computer Engineering).\n\nThings were okay the first few months. I was learning some new skills, but the non-technical tasks would occasionally distract me from the skills I needed to know. When I brought this up at a performance review, the company acknowledged that and said they still wanted me to be a developer.\n\nTime kept passing, and instead of learning more technical things, more non-technical tasks were assigned to me. It got to the point where I was reprimanded for focusing more time on a technical task instead of a non-technical one. Meanwhile, Interns are being promoted to technical positions and passing over me. Its as if I was so competent at the non-technical tasks, it was cheaper for the company to not advance me.\n\nThis has caused a lot of anxiety for me. I've lost a lot of confidence in myself. I didn't realize it at first, but while I'm given non-technical things, people in the industry are gaining they experience need. Meanwhile, my career is going backwards.\n\n\nI would stay at my current position, but it seems the higher ups aren't interested in seeing me advance. \n\nHow do I learn more of the programming skills I need for a pure technical position? Is it spending all my free time doing more coding challenges? I really like embedded systems. For example cross compiling and debugging Linux Kernels on dev boards. While I have a good foundation of C/C++ Python and ARM assembly, I still feel it isn't enough to get another job with yet. How can I be sure what I know is at a \"professional level\"? ",

I also have a pretty good amount of web development experience from student jobs I've done.  \n\nI notice I'm getting very quickly screened out of an inordinate amount of internships and jobs that I feel qualified for (not even getting a coding test); I'm concerned that it's due to the fact that I'm not technically in a degree program at the moment.

I've had my resume reviewed, and do my best to emphasize the skills that I have, but I'm getting hardly any callbacks and I fear it's over something I have no control over save getting a Masters degree, which I would like to avoid.

Not trying to be overly formal, but still respectable. \n\n3 - I'm going to focus on getting to know them rather than trying to impress them. Learn their background, hobbies, and try to relate as best I can. I'll bring a notepad/pen with a lot of prepared CS-relevant questions (see end). At lulls in conversation I'll throw a question out. \n\n4 - End _exactly_ on time and ask permission to add on linkedin.

Without any doubt, he is smart and knows a lot of stuff, but really hard to work with.\n\nI noticed that when I wanted to ask him something, since I'm a junior, so I have a lot of stupid questions, I guess. He tends to be constantly serious, even when other coworkers are joking. Main manager check \"his\" junior every half or an hour if he has any questions, meanwhile this guy came only once to see what I'm doing and even that was because I called him, since he gave me a redundant task, so I spent whole day trying to fix it, until I hit a wall, called him, and after he saw it's impossible, he contacted the owner who said to do totally opposite. One morning, he came to the office, I told him \"good morning\", but he said nothing and instead threw a cable on my desk (I need it for my office PC).\n\nI thought he was just being an asshole to me, but after talking to coworkers who are longer there, I noticed every one is aware of his attitude, but they tend to joke about it, since they might be afraid to say anything.",

When I noticed something was off and they weren't so happy, I was worried I wasn't learning fast enough, or said something out of place when drunk with coworkers. In retrospective it was really dumb not to see it coming that that was the problem.\n\nThat's great that I got a warning because now I know what the problem is and what to change and I can prevent losing the job.\n\nAnother problem is, it's not only my manager, my coworkers are mad too. That's why I was thinking I would've fucked up when drunk instead of actually having a problem with work performance, I didn't expect them to be angry at me for how I do my job. Say what you will but I still want to get along well with them even if I don't seem to be a good cultural fit, I mean the day to day will suck otherwise. I won't be late anymore but I don't know if they'll ever forgive me \ud83d\ude05. This culture is so different from what I'm used to.\n\nI mean I noticed a huge change in attitude, and they LITERALLY stopped inviting me to hang out. When my manager was talking to me to help me improve, he told me some people complained to him, and that one day that I was an hour late because of a hungover 'people was freaking out'.\n\nSo, any tips as for how to make a comeback on both fronts?",

This will be downvoted because many people here have an agenda and want you to believe that the CS field has endless jobs and that everyone is going to get a great salary.\n\nWell it isn't true, and frankly at this point it has very little to do with how good of a programmer you are.\n\nI'm a senior developer at a tech company in NYC. I've been doing this for about 7 years now.\n\nI will keep this simple and blunt... My company is mid sized and has just begun hiring junior developers at $12 an hour, a dollar above minimum wage.\n\nOut of the three new junior developers hired within the last couple of months, one is a college graduate (CS degree), the other two are boot camp grads (non CS degrees).\n\nAll three of them are above average programmers. We've had no trouble with them whatsoever as they are pretty bright. \n\nI was part of the hiring team, and we got around 600 applications for each of these three positions. \n\nThat's a total of 1800 applications for three positions, after only two weeks. After throwing away the applications from people living outside the city (around 300 applicants) and people who we knew were too senior to take such a meager salary (150 applicants) we were still left with over 1000.\n\nOf course we didn't get to anywhere near most of them, but we interviewed around 30 candidates and all but two of them were competent programmers.\n\nThe sad thing is that my boss (the founder) can afford to pay these junior programmers at least 50k annually, but he knows he doesn't have to because the market is so flooded.\n\nIf you're just starting out and you're wondering whether you should major in CS or continue with your degree.... here is my advice to you: Don't do it if you are planning on making any sort of living. Of course you could get lucky, but the market is going to get much worse over the next few years.\n\n**The downvoters and naysayers will post articles from 3+ years ago talking about how the industry is booming, but nothing recently.**\n\nIf you want money go into finance.\n\nAnyway, that's all I have to say about it.

            "selftext": "I'm still applying for a job since graduation months ago.  I've taken on a couple internships as side projects, but they're unpaid and unlikely to lead anywhere special, and I need that sweet sweet $$$.\n\nPretty much every company I apply to ghosts, so it's gotten to the point where I cold apply to just about everywhere, just to see if I'll grab a response.\n\nI got a CSCI bachelor's from a small, no-name university without connections, so I don't have my \"in\" into the industry.  I was hoping I'd be given more shots at interviews to prove my programming skill, but unfortunately it seems that without connections (like one of those \"big 4\" interviews I keep hearing about) and an impressive school name (I.E. MIT), that big first step just isn't going to happen.\n\nIs my only option at this point to beg for jobs at meetups and conferences?  Everyone keeps telling me \"to just keep learning\" so I can seem more hirable, but that doesn't help if I'm never even given a response.\n\nAlso, is it important to have a \"projects\" section on your resume, for toy stuff you made to learn?  I'm considering adding a few apps I made in place of the more university-centric stuff, but I'm not sure if that would be better.\n\nStill not sure if a resume change would magically improve my response rate, but it seems like that may be the problem?  Anyway, I'll stop rambling.\n\nEDIT:  Oh, and would it make sense to put on the internships I'm currently doing on my resume, or should I just leave that out until they're complete?  I figure leave them out until complete, but then it's been my ideas that have gotten me left out in the cold, so they're probably not the best ones.\n\n~~EDIT 2: My resume, hopefully with personal details removed (lemme know if I'm doxxing myself):  https://imgur.com/a/B6XoY~~\n\nEDIT 3:  Thank you for the feedback!  I took down the old resume pic because I changed it.",

Through my research I have found that app development and/or software engineering seems like a potential career path for me.\n\nMy concern is I have no formal qualifications in IT at all, I do also have a degree so in the UK I am unable to go back to university (unless I am able to self-fund which is not an option). I am therefore looking to educate myself and obtain qualifications outside of the university education ecosystem.\n\nI am of course willing to dedicate myself to learning, but it seems to require a huge breadth of knowledge (some of which would be learnable on the job perhaps?). It feels like the road to being confident and capable enough to be able to produce good work would be a long one, and from a selfish perspective I am not sure that coding for 16 hours a day every day is for me.\n\nFrom the wider perspective, my overall goal is to be able to work for myself (either as a freelancer or to build businesses/products with the skills I have learned within IT). I guess that programming would be a great skill which is marketable and also can be used to innovate my own products, but I have heard that freelancing in particular for programming is very competitive and difficult to break into, is there any truth to this?\n\nSorry if this seems like quite a generic post, if I am totally honest I don't know a lot about scrum and am doing lots of research into starting a career in IT and am looking for information and opinions which may help me decide what I want to do.\n\nAny comments are really appreciated :)",

Obviously the last time around I was focused mostly on positions with phrases like \"new grads\" and \"entry level\" prominently shown, but what should I be looking for now that would suit my current level of experience?

            "selftext": "So, a little bit of backstory: effectively the entire development team relevant to me has left the company since I joined as a junior three years ago to a combination of mental breakdowns, burnouts and better offers.\n\nWithout being too disparaging: these people, then my seniors, were woefully short of knowledge on the technologies they had chosen. It was incredibly common to find hundreds of SQL statements executed per page as a result of a routine that would fetch a single column from a row and return it to a variable, repeated for every single column in the row; innumerable statements with unmitigated opportunities for SQL injection; thousands of lines of markup and JavaScript generated by a SQL script that seemed to crawl on forever.\n\nI stayed, though. Eventually I suggested rearchitecting the application to give it even a smidgen of approachability and I was succinctly dismissed.\n\nWhen the final remaining senior had a meltdown and disappeared, I inherited the project. I'd been at the company 2 years by this point and was preparing to jump ship, but saw this new inheritance as a new beginning.\n\nA plan was hatched: I would clean up the codebase, reduce the thousands of daily runtime errors in production to a minimum, train a successor *then* leave for my successor to continue developing new features.\n\nIt's been a year since then.\n\nThe client no longer wants to pay for a second developer, they just want my time for all intents and purposes citing the improvement in efficiency since last year. They also wanted major new deployments, features developed - and I foolishly obliged.\n\nAs a result, I cannot now onboard a second person without causing tension with the client, cannot convince the agency I'm part of to let me onboard another person for free (and stating I'm planning on leaving soon as an incentive isn't an option because from prior experience this is a great way to get you slashed on the spot) - and I don't feel like I can leave because I have barely documented much of anything as tightness and successive nature of deadlines means I have no time to do so.\n\nNow I'm working 70 hour weeks and getting paid for 45 (unpaid overtime) at notably less than market rate per hour for my level of experience. I haven't had a holiday in over a year and every time my phone goes off I have an intense flicker of anxiety no matter the hour. I genuinely feel like I'm on the verge of a breakdown constantly but don't know how to divulge this in real life.\n\nNumerous friends that know me anonymously I've opened up to online have told me to get the fuck outta there - and I agree it has gotta happen: but I still feel guilty because if this project goes, so does the company I work for and they're a nice bunch of guys and I don't want that. Then there's the worry of what they might think of me if I left deadlines looming and features unfinished!\n\nPlease tell me this feeling of attachment and guilt is something somebody here has experienced? If so, what did you do? Did you offer phone support or similar at a set rate for a period after leaving or did you cold turkey them.\n\nI'm aware that I'm at least partially to blame for a lot of this, I'm not making excuses - well, not to anyone but myself. Any words of wisdom would be appreciated and sorry for the massive wall of text.",

            "selftext": "Hello all,\n\nI am a European male which finished his Ph.D. in December of 2016. The Ph.D. topic was related to telecommunication networks, in an engineering department, even if my background was pure CS. I have investigated issues in the level 3 and 4 of the network stack (so, I never went physical :-D). In March, I have found a stable job (40 hours/week) in a software house with a full contract, in the field of automotive simulation, with the role of scientific software engineer: it means that I mostly develop code, in an environment which was not mine before I started this job.\nThen, I have seen an opportunity to get back to research as a post-doc, in the mobile networking field (very close to what I have done during my Ph.D. studies), without any teaching duties (and therefore no academical career). As most Europeans know, it means no stability at all (1-2 years contracts, and then we will see). The salary is also 5% lower than what I have now. The pros/cons are mostly equivalent, so the only thing that matters here is the personal growth/experience that I can get in the next 5/10 years. What is the best option, curriculum-wise? I mean, if the objective of doing a postdoc and then (if I am lucky) some years as a stable researcher is to gain experience and qualifications for getting a job outside the research world... Probably the best option would be to continue where I am now, taking the experience from there instead of changing.\n\nWhat I miss are the stories of people that have done a Ph.D., and that (without going in the academic career) then they stayed as stable researchers before changing and going in the industry. Were these years as postdoc and researcher necessary? The instability and risks are worth the experience or the years as Ph.D. are enough?\n\nThank you!\n",

So i'm kinda new to the software dev company - finishing my provation period of 3 months now as a mid-level dev and the feedback meeting is coming up. \n\nSo my team-leader is pushing remote working into our company culture, he doesn't like people too much and prefers to work from home. We use slack primarily as the in-office communication. Which I don't mind (as you actually get work done) but the problem is that I can see from a project management side and overall-progress the human-contact interaction should be essential. Management, as you know are pushing to get work done so that they can sell. \n\nWe're a team of 4 devs and 2 juniors. The 2 juniors are struggling badly and is costing the company tons of money as they sit on trello cards for 2 days where I know it can be completed in 2 hours. They don't ask for help. So what happens is they either waste time on youtube which distracts- and demotivates me as I'm busting balls trying to make progress. At the end of the day we make progress as my team-leader and I are completing trello cards. We currently have a catch-up meeting once a week (to check on progress and some QA) on a Friday and sometimes on a Monday we structure the to-do's for the week.\n\nWhat I suggest is that perhaps having a mid-week catch-up as well to pin-point where we are struggling and wasting time. \n\nSo my question is would it be a bad thing to stand-up against the team-leader and that there should be a more team-interaction element (to bounce off ideas and so on)?

I tell you what I do for a living and you tell me what my title is.  \n\nMy background is in E-Commerce and I went to school for Economics and Stats.  I've worked for my current employer, a small/medium-sized tech company, for a little over 2 years now where I was hired as a Data Analyst.  A few months before I started here, I finished a coding bootcamp course in Data Science where I started writing in Python.  When I started my current job, I expected to write some SQL, look at numbers, do some math, and tell people who made more money than me what to do about said math.  \n\nOver the first 3-6 months of my job, I took over the grunt work for a reporting engineering deptartment that was dissolved prior to a company re-org.  This included maintaining and optimizing **data ingestion, processing, and storage**; ingesting files from emails and data from APIs, parsing data with **Python and lots of Shell scripting**, and writing to **MySQL/Postgres** databases.  \n\nI inherited this system and for the first 3-6 months, the question I was usually asked was \"where is my data?\".  Over this time I made it a point to make sure no one had any reason to ask me that anymore.  \n\nMonths 6-12 included me flying abroad to develop a solution for a newly acquired startup in another country.  Their database was an Excel sheet, so I set out to build a similar infrastructure for them.  Excel was a key tool for them, so this included learning **VBA** to integrate their current workflow into the system I built, which this time leveraged **AWS** services, which my company had just begun using.  I set up **EC2, RDS instances, and made use of S3** - only using Python to handle dataflow.  \n\nMonths 12-18 was like going back to a marriage right after your first affair.  The processes I had established were pretty airtight and perhaps because the company was growing, there was less pivoting.  With less pivoting came less technical surprises.  It became maintenance from here until the next few months when I started getting back into analysis.  With no systems to worry about, I got to do some **statistical analysis** and a little bit of modeling.  Exploratory data analysis became a huge part of my focus.  With this, I became more involved in the process of displaying data.  Enter: **Flask, some PHP, and minimal Node.js**.  I built a few standalone apps with Flask, tweaked some legacy apps built in PHP, and contributed to some projects built in Node.  Through this I also became a bit more savvy with web servers.  Before this I had no idea things like **gunicorn or nginx** ever existed.\n\nSince then, there have been a few shakeups that have affected my role.  I've shifted back to infrastructure - primarily **monitoring and alerting**.  We tried a bunch of different monitoring platforms for setting up dashboards.  I leveraged the chat client our company uses to handle some alerting.  I also became more familiar with job scheduling platforms (basically fancy schmancy crons).  My department has grown but with more analysts, so occasionally someone will do something that crashes a server or clogs a database.  I've also became much closer to **MapReduce a la Spark and Hadoop**.  I learned more technical things about **EC2s, cluster management, and benchmarking** than I learned about Data Science in the bootcamp course I took.  I still enjoy white-boarding data architectures, so this week I'm **writing a Python library** that leverages some proprietary tech so that these new Analysts can stop being a risk to our infrastructure (half-joking).  \n\nSo here's my existential crisis.  What in the heck am I?  \n\nI went to school for Economics, and have no formal training in CS or IT.  I feel like I've gone in so many directions that I'm worried about landing another position if I decide to move to another company.  I understand that the REAL answer here is \"it's up to you\", but for the sake of an attempt to have a more precise career outlook, if you had to give it a name, what would you call my role during the last 2 years of my career?

However, I suspect that in a normally-sized business, I'd normally be a senior developer.  Is this something I need to find a way to explain away?  Should I just put down \"Senior Developer\" and assume nobody reads my old business cards?\n\n2.  Am I better off trying to aim a bit lower for the next position-- like mid-level developer?  One thing I know is that because of the size of the firm and the way we operated, I'm a little loose on some \"working as a team\" stuff.  (In particular, because there was basically only a single developer, we had nothing resembling source code management except for a few clients who insisted we dump stuff to a Git repository, but even that was hairy and inconsistent)\n\n3. How should I go about documenting my achievements?  Right now, I was thinking about having a section of my resume for \"Featured Major Projects\" summarizing 3 or 4 of our largest, most interesting projects.  These sites still exist for now, so it should be feasible to show them to potential recruiters.   Is a bullet point list of their interesting features a good choice?

I've somehow gotten a few internships every year with really small startups (less than 50 people) managing various tasks right from Data Science to PM and learning a lot on the job. However, I'm graduating soon and have still not been able to get a single interview for a full time role (let alone an offer) from any major tech company or a fortune 500. I'm sick and tired of working at startups because of their culture and poor w/l balance and for many other reasons. I've definitely learnt a lot and I just want to make a move to a more stable job opportunity at a bigger company which I had always been eyeing for since freshman year of college. \n\nIt's been 4 years now and everyday I pick myself up and wake up in the morning, refreshing my email a few times in the hope of hearing back from the bajillion recruiters / managers I cold emailed to, or the few thousand applications I applied online, but in disappointment. I've been strong and resilient enough not to break down with every possible rejection I get from automated emails for 4 years by taking that in my stride and improving myself by doing better and building more challenging projects and publishing it. What hurts more is, every summer / fall I see my other friends (from other universities) working / interning at one of the Big N and I feel so happy for them andI envisage to have the privilege and work for those companies some day too, and I tell myself that this would me very soon, but I'm just tired of doing this over and over again and sick of not being able to be where I had planned to be at the timeline what I had set for myself. At this point, I'm so low in my motivation and self-esteem that even if I'd tell myself that I'd succeed some day, I almost immediately laugh at the how stupid that sounds, since I've given up on myself and the fact that I've been consistently forcing myself to believe and do things that was way out of my league. I sometimes agree that I attempt to take up extremely hard challenges for the rewarding results and how much I can learn from it, but most times (or all times) have failed at successfully nailing them. I've reached a point where my parents are not longer emotionally supporting me and are asking me to take up any job that I could find. This is since my parents are extremely old to support me (and even themselves) barraged with loans. I need to replace my dad as the sole breadwinner of the family so I could let him retire (he has been working 24x7 since there's no one else who could support him and has an ailing disease which if not taken proper care of, could make him permanently bed rested for his few years of life that he has left). Everytime I think about the foolish \"Go big or go home\" plan, I tear up and feel that I've just not been able to achieve things what I had always desired for and have been horribly unlucky in not getting opportunities what my other friends at the better universities get (since the big companies visit their campus and are easily considered for intern / FT roles) while I struggle to even get an interview here with all the effort that I put in, and sometimes I go out of my way to do harder things that I've almost never seen any of my friends at the bigger companies even do to get a job. \n\nI'm sick and disappointed of how unfair the entire system, I started off knowing this was true, but I started challenging myself to prove this false, and ended up convinced that there are always people who have things easy without working as hard as how other people who are more deserving have worked. \n\n**TL;DR:** \nSenior year, worked at 4+ startups doing dev/PM roles and looking for a job at a bigger company, but after trying for 3+ years, verge of giving up on hopes of looking for a CS job and looking for alternatives for the time being until I get to the bigger companies. Stuck in a terrible family financial situation with ailing parents and forced to earn ASAP. Looking for advice, since I'm emotionally and mentally tensed, verge of a mental breakdown and I feel I should start working at a nearby Starbucks part time for paying the bills.\n \nPlease help.

            "selftext": "Hey CSCQ, I'm a senior at a small state school and I have two offers I'm currently seriously considering for after graduation this spring. The salaries for both are comparable when you adjust for COL, but there are a couple differences:\n\nJob 1 is in Minneapolis working for a huge company. It would be out in the 'burbs which means either a long commute or having to live in the suburbs as a young 20-something which is not ideal. The signing and relocation bonuses are also way low compared to job 2. However the benefits and perks for this company are out of this world. Not just \"free lunch\" or \"ping pong table\" (though those are both available) I'm talking tons of PTO, potentially infinite work from home time (within reason, manager permitting), great health coverage, and more. The work is fulfilling being in the healthcare space, and I would be starting as a junior data scientist which is a career path I've been interested in for a long time.\n\nJob 2 is in Seattle, which is the city I was born in and the city I ultimately want to end up in. It's a big name company, not Google or anything but having the name on my resume would be enough to get me a leg up for future jobs, and on top of a significantly higher relocation/signing bonus I would get stock on hiring. However the benefits from what I can tell are very bare-bones in comparison to job 1. I'd also be starting as a new grad SWE instead of going into data science, which wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing but is something I'm weighing negatively against it compared to job 1.\n\nI have a month to decide, as after that my already small signing bonus at job 1 will start to shrink the longer I wait. I think I'd be a good fit on my assigned teams at both companies, so it really comes to this:\n\n**TLDR job 1 is better but in a worse location, while job 2 is worse in a much better location.

            "selftext": "Hey, so I am about to start college in the computer engineering program. I have been doing quite a bit of research about things I can do to help with my future employment  and develop my skills as a programmer. I have a few questions so I figured here would be a good place to ask.\n\n- I'm hearing that side projects are very important to develop skills and build a portfolio. What type of programs should I make? I know that first semester we will be learning python, and then second semester java. Should I build something with these languages or would it be better to learn a different language for side projects? I've read that web development projects could be good, but i'm unsure. \n\n- should I start any side projects during my first year or should I wait until the summer or next year?\n\n- Is there any benefit to taking computer engineering over computer science? At my school, computer engineering is basically computer science but we take Electrical engineering classes in place of electives. So basically its quite a bit harder. However, It seems that computer engineering and computer science majors end up competing for the same jobs, so is there really any benefit in being in Comp eng?\n\n- what are some good extracurriculars to help me develop my skills, networking etc.?\n\n- any other tips for first year\n\nThanks A lot!\n",

I have been self employed for the past four years developing and selling commercial iOS apps with a small amount of freelance work on the side. Doing this gave me more freedom and allowed me to earn significantly more than I would have if I had taken an internship or two.\n    \n###Dilemma\nNow I'm going to be graduating without any internships on my resume which is definitely a red flag for potential employers. I'm conflicted on how to portray this on my resume. \n  \n###Options  \n* Include the projects I worked on in a projects section despite the fact that they were my source of (self) employment. I worry that this would make it look like I was unable to find employment and that my resume would consist of almost entirely projects.  \n* Add them under work experience but make it clear that I was self employed. I worry that employers may see self employment as a negative due to potential flight risk or not take it seriously.  \n  \nIf it makes any difference, I go to a mid tier university in Canada but do have a 97% major average which may help boost my resume a small amount.\n  \n### TL;DR\nI have no internships due to being self employed while in university and don't know how to portray this on my resume in a manner that won't turn off potential employers.\n\nAdvice on the best way to portray this would be greatly appreciated.  \nThanks in advance.",

Maybe I'm overvaluing this experience (sort of the proverbial \"grass-always-greener\" effect)?\n\nAt this point I'd consider myself a very good programmer (it's been about a year on the job). I've picked up a lot of more \"concrete\" concepts that can be applied to the process of developing software and a lot of cloud experience as well.

In any case, if I go this route, I'd owe n-years to the company (obv. they want an ROI); so I'd need to weigh whether they'd follow through with a sufficient raise despite a lack of incentive to do so.\n\nCan anyone give me some advice, preferably backed by their own experience w/ weighing the prospect of graduate school (MS) for computer science?",

I know a lot of work in this area is out of academia and a graduate degree is preferred, but I really don't have any interest in grad school immediately (although I might want to come back in a few years). I have both taken and TAed the PL and Compilers courses at my uni, so I'm not completely unprepared.\n\nObviously a lot of PL work is Open Source, and then the big Google+Microsoft, but are there any other companies I should look at applying to that would be willing to take on a new grad?

            "selftext": "I'll be venting out all my thoughts here, so apologies if it becomes too big.\n\n--------------------------\n\nI am a final year student pursuing bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering in India. I'll start with how I ended up where I am,\n\nAbout 4-5 years ago, I was studying in 11th-12th science, having no idea what I was going to do with my life. Then one day, I got to knew about Linux and fell  in love with it. I'd spend whole day trying to learn something new about Linux, helping people on forums and improving my bash/C programming skills. This love for Linux eventually converted into love for programming and then for computer science and engineering.\n\nUnfortunately, this resulted in negligence towards studying physics, maths and chemistry, which is what the entrance exam for engineering is based upon. I scored barely passing mark in theory papers, and scored just average marks in entrance exam. Ended up getting admission for CSE in a tier 3 college(IITs and NITs are at top, below them are top private and autonomous colleges, and below them are colleges like one I'm from, and finally, below even these, there are colleges not worth calling colleges)\n\n-------\n\nI won't say I am a 10x programmer, and I am surely no match for a new grad coming out of MIT, Standford or UCB. Nevertheless, I am also sure that I am not the shitty  programmer you'd expect out of a tier 3 college in India. I have always loved programming and computer science and have put a lot of effort to improve myself.\nI am very good with C++14 and Java, and there are many other languages I know. I know how to use git. I use good programming practices and use good frameworks and patterns where ever I can. I know how to use spring framework, flask to create RESTful API. This year I'd be creating a website along with it's backend, so I'll learning a lot more deep into spring framework, html/CSS frameworks and Javascript frameworks. I also have experience using aws and am planning to use serverless architecture for a simple pet project. This is not all though.\n\nAgreed, this all is not that impressive, but at least (I hope) it proves that I am not a shitty engineer.\n\n----------------\n\nThe problem I am having is with getting a job I'd actually love to do. There are basically 3 types of companies that hire CS engineers in India.\n\n1. Service based companies. These work for foreign companies and provide support to them. I could get a job here easily, but I don't want to. They just care about your soft skills (which I am good at). They don't even care if you don't have CS background. They'll literally hire mechanical engineers with no programming experience. I can't imagine myself doing tech support job for rest of my life.\n\n2. The big MNCs. Like google and amazon aws. They do some interesting stuff, but they hire only from top colleges. No chance for me to even get my resume on the table.\n\n3. Startups and small scale product companies. This is what I am aiming for. \n\n--------\n\n Problem is that I am from a tier 3 college. And after brexit and trump's new policies, recruiting has taken a big hit, especially for freshers. No company has visited my college for recruitment, and none seems to coming. I am applying through linkedin and other platforms, but I guess my resume gets discarded when they see that, 1. I am from tier 3 college 2. I don't have any professional experience.\n\nI feel like I am stuck in a traffic, that is not moving, and I have no where to go. Life feels like being one in a herd of sheep, with no future, except just following the lead sheep and going wherever the dogs take you. I really want to get a job in writing code. I don't want to end up doing some maintenance or tech support job. Unfortunately, as graduation day comes closer(about 9 months left), I feel like my destiny was decided the day I took admission itself.\n\nSometimes I regret being a part of this rat race, but there's nothing else I can do well, nothing else attracted me as much as programming did. This is all I have ever wanted to do.",

I've been advised on many occasions to opt for Master's in Computer Science as that along with an engineering degree would open many opportunities for me. \n\nMy concern is the expectation a Master's program in CS may have from its applicants in the form of a background in CS. Ideally I'd like to join a Master's program that caters to people from other backgrounds as well.\n\nMy interests are pretty broad but generally speaking I like working with Hardware, especially Hardware programming \n\n\nThoughts?

Yes, completely subjective and apologies for the self-indulgent post, feeling a bit angsty given soon-to-be-graduated status.\n\nTwo years ago I started studying CS at an unremarkable university. Throughout my time here, I've aced my classes, worked two internships, dicked around with all sorts of fun ideas; Overall, I've been exposed to the discipline and frankly, I really enjoy it...in certain ways, working at my own pace. By the time I graduate, I most likely will have a full-time job with a salary most Americans would kill for. But it's nothing compared to what the extremely adept developers are, from what I perceive, capable of accomplishing. \n\nI'm well aware of society's skewed emphasis on young, passionate, successful adults who seem to have been precocious children. Yet, at this age I still can't help but compare myself to them. These are the guys who I imagine stay up until the wee hours of the morning, pounding away at code in a state of flow until it works. They're the ones who have interned at multiple big 4 companies starting from their first year of college. The ones who have projects on GitHub that have attracted the attention of a niche of the open source community at large. When I take all of that into consideration, I realize how much talent is really out there and frankly, it's terrifying despite knowing that there's still a place for most people in the field given that they have half a brain. But I think I could do something great in the field...at the cost of tremendous dedication and discipline, which I'm not sure I have for the craft.\n\nFrom someone who has reached a highly esteemed position in their career, was it worth it? Assuming that you had to work hard and make sacrifices, were those sacrifices worth it? Would you have, in retrospect, spent your time elsewhere?\n",

During this summer I have jumped  around so many thing I feel like I have learned some things but not enough. I've worked on my C++, taught myself emacs, leaned how to use the basics of CMake, switched to Linux (tried Arch Linux failed installation then switched to Antergos), and tried to learn a little about web development. All of them are just little improvements but I feel like other students around me are doing much more in terms of improving their knowledge of computer science. It's really hard for me to find any internships because I live in what feels like a no mans land for technology.**I feel like I really have no guidance in terms of what I should be focusing on when I'm teaching myself; Usually I start trying to teach myself something and then I start thinking that learning something else is more important so I switch to that and so on and so on. I feel like I am just going around in a circle.** \n\nNow I am trying to learn data structures to get ahead of my next class and am trying to refresh myself on Java.

I've been musing on going back to school and getting a MS in CS ( and yes, I know I have to fill some pre-req's, and that is not an issue with me ). The main reason why, is that ( and I think this is a collective belief) that CS is where the largest chunk of innovation will be in this century, and as a field, it has the largest room for creativity. My concerns focus on what I hear about the need to get into CS young - where as if I go through with this, I will be ~31 to 33 when I get out with an MS. Anyone out there who has been in a similar situation? Or otherwise, what are some other things I need to think about here? ",

We have a department that is 20 people deep that is heavy on the development side (11 out of 20 are developers generally).\n\n I am currently position as a lead developer / manager.  My day basically consists of the following.\n\n1. A third programming\n2. A third architecture\n3. A third management / working with the business.\n\nI manage a team of 3 - 5 developers / analysts, have a little less than 500k a year to spend on technology, make the final hiring decision for developers, etc.  My base salary is 70k and then I get another 15% to 20% of my base salary a year as a management bonus which usually puts me around 85k.  Additionally it's very likely I will move into a 100 - 110k a year director position in the next year.  I only have about 4 legitimate years of relevant work experience and technically I only graduated in 2015 (because I stopped and worked for two years mid degree).\n\n\nWhile I am pretty comfortable where I am I have a few concerns.\n\n1. I've been there for two years now \n2. It's not a software company or a fortune 500\n3. Engineering culture is only so-so and is mostly based around the process/manufacturing/design engineering side.\n4. Problems are only semi-challenging and I'm getting bored.\n\nIt might sound a bit conceded but I was recently mentioned in a bug bounty program and was asked if I wanted to include my company name in the \"notable mention\" page under my name.  I looked and most other people did include their company and it was all people working for companies I recognized.  I have friends who are pretty high up the engineering ladder at Dell, Oracle, IBM, and IEEE that keep hounding me to join their teams.  Working for a tier 1 company like Google, Uber, etc is out of the question for me most likely although AWS has been contacting me on and off for a while.\n\nI am interested in these offers because of the following.\n\n1. Company name recognition\n2. Probably slightly more interesting problems\n3. Slightly better pay (probably only a 5 - 10k increase)\n\nI am slightly worried because I don't want to make a jump into a worse position.  I am constantly worried about Indian developers and want to get into 100% management as soon as possible.  I have a clear management target at my current position and it's unknown at those other positions.  Also I don't have any money saved.\n\nMy question's are basically as follows.\n\n1. Is name recognition of a Tier II software company on my resume important for my career?\n2. Is it silly to switch companies for such little pay increase?\n3. Is working at a software company better for career than working at a manufacturing company that is of medium size?\n\nAlso, there is a really small software company in my city that does some pretty insane work in computer vision.  The developer positions are 1/2 development 1/2 research.  I am extremely interested in working for this company but they didn't respond to my resume first time around.  I have a very wide skill set but my work experience is almost exclusively in the JVM ecosystem and it's all in business processing / enterprise messaging.  What they do is very heavy in C++ and is very mathematical.  I do have a very strong linux background which they desire though.\n\nAny suggestions on how to get a response with my work history being so drastically different?",

            "selftext": "Hi,\n\nSome very quick background about myself, which I think is relevant:\nI was a little lazy growing up the same way I'm sure a lot of other people were, disappointing GPA coming out of high school, went to local state school, 2 meaningless years and I dropped out. However, I got my act together, worked hard, enrolled in CC, and transferred to a top school in the northeast, one I would have thought I have no business being at considering how poorly I did prior. \n\nThis is where the question comes in. My parents help me out financially by covering rent and food expenses, a blessing I'm not overlooking. I was able to transfer 60 credits- about half the graduation requirement. But in starting over, I chose a new career path- CS- which means I essentially had to complete a CS education in about 2.5 years rather than the full four. This means that I have to be selective with which electives and courses I take. \nI just finished a pretty full first year of courses and got most of the essentials out of the way, but I'll be in the market for a junior internship- yet my programming breadth and depth knowledge can be described as freshman. \n\nBut this school, for all it does for me, is really expensive. Like really expensive. A 3 credit class is $5000. I need a total of 30 more credits to be eligible for graduation, but I'm now having to make decisions based on the financials involved rather than purely school reasons, as Im in the private loan game.\n\nBtw, if any more info is needed, please ask in the comments, its hard to be able to include all relevant info off the top of my head in this post. \n\nOk, if you've read this far, the questions are as follows. I'm registered for an introduction to cryptography course that I was looking forward to taking that is purely theoretical and doesn't teach any hardcore practical skills. A general consensus is that I should be broadening my CS horizons and making sure I know about all that's out there, but I'm nervous to waste precious time and money on something that won't help me land a job- the #1 most important thing for me. I like and appreciate the theory of CS and would probably enjoy it much more if I didn't have to bankroll this school. I already have a courseload that involves the rigorous C programming course and a quick course that teaches python. Should I replace the theory cryptography course with one that is programming based and teaches practical skills?\n\nThanks a lot for the help, and again, any additional info you need, just ask, it's hard to remember it all off the top.\n\nTLDR: Go to expensive school, a 3 credit course is $5000, I only have 3 semesters left and freshman-level experience, should I eschew a theory-based cryptography course I wanted to take for a practical programming course instead if my #1 focus is getting a well-paying job out of school",

The reason I feel so is .\n1) The code sucks- They made interns to wrote their whole app. And there no good practises, god classes and I don't understand what to do in the code. However in such a bad application they expect me to fix their bugs.Naturally I suggested we need to fix the code first however they said they don't have much time to fix the code as they want me to work on some other application too.\nWorst of all they don't even have any senior developers.\n\n2) Unspecified responsibility :- So I work at this company as an Android developer. However they don't have any IOS developer and they want me to write code for IOS too. Here's the truth I don't know a shit about IOS development. In fact I don't even own an Iphone. At the time of interview .I clearly mentioned that I am not ready to work on IOS still they are trying to push  me to work on IOS.\n\n3)Lack of facility:- So in Android we need some emulator's to test our code. So the one that comes with the IDE isn't that good. So I suggested them to go for a paid emulator's however they want me to work on free one cause they say they can't afford as they are the \"small company\".\nHere's the second rant.The place where I work there's no canteen or any hotels nearby when I leave office typically at 7:00 I feel hungry as fuck. I have to travel all the way to my place so I can eat something good.\n\n\n\nI feel a heck lot demotivated to work in such environment .However as I am a fresher. I guess  I had to continue to work here for sometime.Currently I learning some stuff so I can get a job at other place. Can someone give me some advice as to what should I do.",

I got into the field of cs by attending a hackathon and being absolutely blown away by it (**this** is what I wanna do for the rest of my life kind of feeling). Being that my high school was a tiny tiny school with not a lot of resources, I only had the chance to take a college level \"Computer Science Principles\" in my senior year. During this course, I learned the principles behind coding (what to do, what not to do, how to manage complexity and the idea of \"abstraction\") and a little bit of Javascript through \"code studio (studio.code.org)\". Due to having gotten a 5 (max score) on the test, I am not required to take the 101 for computer science in my first semester. \n\nMy question is: where do I go from here? I want to learn more about coding (and possibly get an edge in my future courses), but I have no idea where to start. I've browsed the internet and there are so many suggestions and options as to what I should learn, what I should do, what languages to focus on, what languages NOT to focus on, etc. Frankly, it's a little overwhelming. I think I want to pursue javascript for now, and I want to start programming small projects (maybe some simple games?) for personal fun and to learn more.\n\nThanks!!",

            "selftext": "Hi guys,\n\nLong time lurker, first time poster here. I'm a recent college grad: May '16, with a bachelor's of Electrical Engineering. I was always somewhat unfocused in my STEM studies, I was briefly a physics major, and I took mainly computer engineering classes as my concentration. At graduation, I decided I wanted to go into software development, rather than a more EE-like job, since I figured I'd have better job prospects. I got a job through a new college hires program at a large bank/financial services company. \n\nCurrently, I'm officially a software engineer as my title, and I was placed in the investment banking division. However, I've been feeling more and more like I'm really just an \"accountant on steroids\" at my current position. I work heavily with accountants and other back office teams, mainly to produce financial reports for them. However, I haven't felt like I'm growing technically - most of what i'm producing is ultimately just relatively simple SQL select statements.\n\nThe difficulty of my job is understanding the finance principles behind the data I'm pulling, and conferring with our stakeholders on what they want. Admittedly, this has been a major growth area, and I feel much more competent in my business domain knowledge, which has been the upside of my role. But, I don't honestly know how transferable this knowledge is - it feels like ultimately I could leverage this to get a job at another bank, but that's not where I want to end up. Mentors and friends have mentioned that gathering requirements will be a big hold up at any tech role. That makes sense to me, but it feels like it's to an extreme in my case. I'll often have times where I'm not coding anything at all and waiting for a response to an email for days.\n\nMy team and its technology stack isn't ancient, at least I'm not programming COBOL, but there isn't much feature development that I'm doing. A lot of what we do is bogged down by hour-long mandatory meetings. We don't, as you could guess, practice agile. My manager is a nice guy and supportive, and I think I'm doing a decent to good job overall per my conversations with him, but ultimately I feel like this isn't the right fit for me.\n\nI've spoken to others about this, and one suggestion that was given to me was working on side projects to stay sharp, but I honestly feel so drained and scatterbrained after work most days that I can't even think to pick up a computer and attempt to write something. Is this burnout or do I just dislike my job? I'm nervous I'll feel this way at any software job I end up getting. I've been working on finding a new role to transfer to for a few months now, and should have one in the next 2-3 weeks, but how do I combat this feeling of burnout so I'm fresh and ready for this new role?\n\nTL;DR: current job isn't challenging me, hard to find excitement about coding - how do I fight this feeling of \"burnout\" so I enjoy coding?",

I've looked at hundreds of job posts at companies of various sizes all over the USA and almost all of them require or strongly imply a desire to have a BS in either one.\n\nI'm hoping this would give me a stronger foundation and a better background (my higher math skills need work, I admit) which would open more doors than \"client X needs CRUD website on an absurd timeline\". A MS is also a goal, before 40 if I can fit the time.\n\nI am employed full time. So I need a flexible option to do this where neither work nor schooling would interfere very much.\n\nThe only places I have seen so far are Georgia Techs online offering, and Oregon State.

            "selftext": "Hi /r/cscareerquestions! I recently went through the recruiting period of trying to get another job with ~2 years industry experience and I wanted to share my experience here. There are posts describing the recruiting experience while in college or right after college, but few about experienced hires, so I thought my experience could be helpful.\n\n**Background**\n\nI am in my early twenties with two years of experience at a public tech company that you might have heard of. I mainly focused on backend systems, that is building out various microservices in AWS. I graduated from a top private school with my bachelors in CS. I was working in a tier-2 tech city (i.e. not SF / NYC / Seattle), because I wanted to move to somewhere new after college. After two years, I thought I had gotten enough out of my current company and also wanted to move to a larger city. The main aspects I was looking for in a new job were company quality, team fit, and city location.\n\n**Preparation**\n\nMy first time recruiting straight out of college, I had felt that I did not sufficiently prepare for algos and data structures, so this time around I made sure to get enough practice. I started about 3-4 months out practicing on oj.leetcode.com just doing 1-2 problems everyday and then ramping up the intensity in both number of problems and quantity of problems. At the end of this entire process I had done ~300 problems on leetcode, though I believe that the sweet spot is ~150. Another point is that the premium subscription on leetcode is worth it, since the questions by company section were accurate, at least in my experience.\n\n**Finding Companies**\n\nI actually did not do too much outbound searching. I marked that I was looking for new opportunities in SF / NYC / Seattle on my linkedin profile and I had a enough recruiters contact me that I was able to choose from there. I did have one friend refer me to a Big 4, but that was about it. I think I was remiss here not to send more outbound applications, but recruiters did represent a fair share of the companies I had already wanted to work for.\n\n**Interviewing**\n\nAh the fun part. The interview process had not changed significantly from college in that it could still be represented by the following directed acyclic graph: recruiter call -> first phone screen -> potential second screen -> onsite -> offer. The interested part was navigating the process while also working full-time. Fortunately, my company was a believer in work from days, so I usually did my phone screens and calls during those. Scheduling-wise, I did all my phone screens in one month and then scheduled my on-sites over the next two months. I scheduled my on-sites on Mondays and then took those days off in advance. Again I was fortunate to be working at a company with a very liberal PTO policy. I believe my manager definitely knew I was interviewing in those days off, but I had a good relationship with him beforehand and had been performing well thus far at the company.\n\nOne thing that caught me off guard was how short the offer period for some of these companies were. The shortest deadline I had was three days from the offer. So I would recommend that if you want to compete offers, make sure to schedule the onsites of the competitive offers closer together. My schedule somewhat adhered to this advice, as I had onsite with less desirable companies in one month and the next month I had more competitive companies.\n\nAs for the interviews themselves, they were different from my new grad interviews in a few salient ways. The first is the presence of design interviews. I used this https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer to study for those interviews.  I believe it covers most of what comes up. You should also have first hand experience doing this in your job if you are an industry hire. The second is that interviewers, especially for more senior positions, want you to deep dive into projects you had previously done at your last job. You should know the technical and architectural aspects of your projects extremely well, but also details such as how it bought business value to the company and what kinds of thing you would have done differently this time around. Finally, interviewers might expect answers to details such as why you are leaving your current position and what kind of career trajectory you are seeking.\n\nBeyond that, my interviews mainly consisted algorithms and data structures. I would say that onsite followed the 80/20 principle of 80% being related to algos and DS and 20% being other details. It is an often-repeated tirade here that to get a job you just have to grind leetcode. My experience as an industry hire is that grinding leetcode is the most important component, certainly necessary, but no longer sufficient. Jobs will expect you show your industry experience through other aspects, such design or how you handled non-technical workplace challenges.\n\n**Results**\n\nI had onsites at 7 different companies. The composition of that was 2 start-ups, 3 Big4, 2 medium-large companies. In the end I received 6 offers distributed among the SF / NYC / Seattle areas. For the smaller or medium sized companies I was able to come in at a senior level, whereas the larger companies I would be coming in as an experienced junior. The exception to this was %RAINFOREST_COMPANY%, from which I received a SDEII offer, which I believe is a \u201csenior\u201d position. In the end, I ended up choosing to move to NYC, because I liked the city, and work for a finance company which is somewhat commonly mentioned on this forum.\n\nCompensation-wise, even though I was living in a tier-2 tech city with lower cost of living, and thus lower total comp, I found that most of these offers did not take that into account significantly. I believe this is because most established tech companies have compensation bands based on position, from which previous comp does not significantly impact. At two years of experience, adjusted for location COL, my offers come in around ~200k total comp.\n\n\n**Reflections**\n\nFinding another job is a lot of work, and I would not like to go through the process often. I cannot imagine how hard it would be for someone who had more responsibilities than I, as a single early-twenties guy, to go through this process. Although it was fun to spend weekends in new cities on the interviewing company\u2019s dollar, flying out every weekend did take its toll on me. \n\nAt the same time, I was surprised by the wealth of opportunities that came through inbound recruiter messages. I think we, as software engineers in the US, are incredibly lucky to have such geographic mobility and variety of jobs.\n\nAnyways, feel free to ask any questions. I wrote this up to hopefully be a resource to the community.\n\n\n\n",

I have one internship whose official title is \"Biometrics Engineering Intern.\"  I did work in computer vision using MATLAB and C++.  Is this not considered relevant experience for entry level SDE roles?  Should I alter the internship title to \"Biometrics *Software* Engineering Intern\" although that is not quite the official name (though in terms of content of the internship, I have zero guilt in doing this because I was indeed writing code from scratch)?\n\nOr am I in trouble because employers for general entry level SDE jobs really want to see web development skills and it's obvious that I know nothing about web development (Languages I have listed are:  Java, Python, C/C++, MATLAB, R)?  My only projects are a DB course project from school using Oracle and some predictive analytics projects involving machine learning.  For the latter, yes I am leaning on libraries like sklearn and do not expect to get anything close to a real data science job with them, but they are finished products and should IMO be better than nothing (esp. for a fresh grad), no?\n\nBasically, the free time I spent on ML MOOC's and Kaggle-like projects appears to have been a complete waste of my time because it's obviously not anywhere near good enough to sniff data science jobs without experience with higher math and BIG/messy data sets (not to mention probably need a Master's) and I should have instead used all that free time learning web development instead.  So it appears I am caught in no man's land without any kind of competency desired by employers.  Any advice for my situation?  Thanks in advance!\n\nEDIT:  I did get a return offer from my internship, but was looking to expand my options because not sure I want to stick with \"Biometrics Engineering.\"",

I am interested in internships in the Bay Area and Socal.\n\n I'll be studying abroad from early this month until the end of December, which I expect will make onsite interviews a challenge. I have an internship return offer from one of the Big Four, but would like to experience a different company environment with my last summer internship. My worry is that I'll be unable to get an offer since I won't be able to make it to onsite interviews during this time frame. Do any of you have experience with getting internship offers without onsites? Would reputable companies be willing to make an exception in this case? How risky would it be to try to get an internship offer after I return? This would almost certainly mean declining my current return offer prior to getting another offer, and having this gap seems risky.\n\nThank you! ",

            "selftext": "I'm having difficulty gauging my current career position in life. I am roughly three years removed from graduating with my M.S. in Computer Science and I have been at my current job for two years.\n\nThe job is incredibly flexible and comfortable. I have an office, flexible hours, limited supervision, no mandatory meetings, short commute. My responsibilities besides handling support and feature requests for the current software system includes the sole development of a new software system to replace the current (without going into specifics).\n\nI was originally enticed into the position because I was pitched the idea of marketing the new software system as a product rather than just an internal system for use. I worked by myself on this project, handling everything from front-end/back-end, database organization, unit/integration testing, and technical/general usage documentation. Producing roughly 80,000 lines of code across a multiple hundreds of files. Which may sound like a small code base (and I recognize that quality is not measured in LOC), however I was/am the single architect/developer of this system and I'm trying to convey the amount of work I've done. Roughly a year into my job and after scouting out similar proprietary products, I determined that open source would be a better approach as far as releasing the system to other potential users. Maybe I was just too overzealous to see the reality of my situation.\n\nWhen I started, the salary was 52k. After a year, everyone was given a hard raise of only 1%. This year, no raises. I had to lobby for a position upgrade which resulted in a 3% raise. So after two years and 80k lines of code, I'm at 54k. I love the comfort and control of the job, however it is incredibly demotivating when I see that I have a graduate degree in one of the best ROI majors possible and I'm making only 54k. Though I live in a relatively LCOL area (Southeast), there are many developers who are making 10k more within the same organization because their position title dictates that salary. Despite my contributions, I couldn't convince HR to re-title me similarly and thus only a 3% raise. \n\nSo, I have reached a pay ceiling at my current job. Most people would recommend looking for another job immediately\u00a0 (and elsewhere). The only attachments is that I did purchase a cheap house. Renting is significantly more expensive than buying (even with maintenence costs factored in). I reasoned that I could use the property as a passive income stream in the event of moving elsewhere. I also don't want to abandon the project that I have been working on since starting this job. Even if the project never sees any success outside the walls of my current employment, I would like to use it as a demonstration of work I've done.\n\nOther smaller obstacles to leaving is the general comfort of the current job in contrast to the more stressful and stringent atmosphere of better paying jobs and also the amount of interview prep necessary to land such jobs.\n\nSo my current plan is to work as hard as possible to complete my current project at work within the next 4-6 months, this would decrease my workload to mainly maintenance and documentation while I explore other opportunities and revisit interview prep-work. Meanwhile, I will try to look into freelance/other business opportunities to supplement my primary income since there are little to no decent employment opportunities nearby.\n\nI'm really trying to gather some perspective on my situation and determine if my current course of action is ideal.",

He told me that the reason he included Math as his second major was with the hopes that it will increase in future earning potential and open up more job prospect not available to those who don't have a math background.\n\nThat got me wondering if perhaps I should consider a Math major as well or minor in it. Out of curiosity, what kind of opportunities open up for someone who has a strong math background?\n\nIf I want to increase my earning potential, will having a strong math background be important or at least make it easier?\n\nBelow are the math courses that comes with the standard CS degree:\n\n- Linear Algebra, Calc I-II, Statistics/Probabilities, Discrete Math.\n\nAnything else I should consider taking?",

            "selftext": "Well, I fucked up.\n\nHere's the abridged version of my story. When I graduated high school, I didn't actually want to go to college, I wanted to be lazy and get a shitty job with no regard to my future. But, I went because I felt pressure from my parents. You can probably already tell where this is going.\n\nI chose computer science because that's what my dad did, and I liked computers, so I thought I would enjoy CS. I did not. This is partially due to the absolutely terrible professors I have had, but I dedicate at least 80% of my conundrum to my own bad attitude. I have a 3.2 GPA, no extra-curriculars, no personal projects outside of the ones I've done for class, no internships, and should have graduated already. I became apathetic and dropped out with only 30 credit hours left from graduation.\n\nI've been working for the last year at a shitty job, and suddenly realized that I *do* want to go back to school and make a better life for myself. I think I will actually enjoy CS now that I crave a challenge. Thus, I reapplied and have been accepted for the Spring semester. However, I have no idea how to recover. Here are my main questions:\n\n* Are there any good online resources for the most important CS classes? I've been lurking this subreddit since I made my decision to go back, and it looks like Data Structures and Algorithms is the most important class. It's also the class I did the worst in (though I did pass). I would really be grateful if there were online lectures that I could watch to get a better feel for the material. After that, I will likely do a LOT of practice problems.\n\n* Am I completely fucked for applying for internships? Will the youngins beat me due to the fact they took their shit seriously from day 1? I also am not located near a tech hub. My school is the University of Florida.\n\n* Will I be able to get a job without an internship? I'm 100% okay with not working for one of the bigger companies. In fact, I would actually prefer to work for a smaller company at first, even if it doesn't pay as well. For the past year, I've been working as a technical consultant at a computing help desk. Perhaps that may work in my favor?\n\n* Will anyone even *want* to work with me/give me work on a project with my below par CS knowledge? Or do I just need to be more confident in my problem solving skills?\n\nI really appreciate any and all advice you guys could give me. I'm very worried but I refuse to give up.",

I spoke to my wife the other night about this and I told her I would like to write letters to the places I would love to work someday with a theme similar to the song \"is there a heaven for a G\" pretty much saying that hey...I'm not a coder...I'm not an app dev guy..im not a web app guy...im a guy with practical support experience in enterprise environments with excellent people skills. Working at GT I've literally seen Google recruiters chase students through the halls basically begging them to return their phone calls...and I know they're basically wanted to be coders or soft dev people...but I'm not interested in sitting behind a desk all day chugging monster to stay awake to hit a deadline...Im interested in getting out and talking to people...helping them gather a better understanding of technology and making them smile with a few corny jokes.\n\nI'm also interested in career development from the perspective of a mentor...I currently manage a student worker staff of 12 and although they're all GT CS students I talk to them about their short term & long term career goals. I try to provide what insight I do have and I enjoy that aspect of my job. \n\nI'm 25 now with my eye on a management or director position at perhaps another college (big name)\u00a0 but ultimately I'm interested in working at one of the big name companies or schools I.E. Google, Oracle, Apple, Facebook, Twitter, Mailchimp,Harvard IT, Columbia,\u00a0 M.I.T.

Their computer science program was quite dated and small. All I learned was essentially some Java, C++, a little C#, a little assembly language, and one course in databases/SQL. I learned nothing in web development. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe town I live in has almost zero tech jobs. I would move, but I've been tied here until my fiance finishes his degree (this December!). Since he is finishing soon, we're looking to move by next Spring. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nSince graduating, I was working on a master's degree online in software engineering. I completed one year of the program before having to drop out due to a terrible UC flare up that put me in the hospital 4 times. While recovering I decided to gain some web development skills, and I completed the front-end developer section of freecodecamp. I really enjoyed working with JS in solving freecodecamp's algorithm challenges, but fiddling with HTML and CSS to make a page look \"nice\" isn't my cup of tea. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo with my fiance graduating soon, I can finally move. I could continue my master's, but I'd honestly rather find a job first with the possibility of continuing my master's degree later.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI just feel so woefully unprepared for getting a cs job, especially since the most programming I've done since graduating was my time with freecodecamp. I fear this may be too general of a question, but are there any technologies I should know that would help better prepare me for a job? I'm very willing to learn, but I usually learn much better in a structured program that can help guide me into what to learn. This is why I really excelled at using freecodecamp. Thanks for reading this far.\n\n&nbsp;\n\ntl;dr: Graduated from small cs program. Living in small town with no cs jobs.

The microservices could be in containers on the same machine or they could be on different machines.\n\nI was asked whether the microservices should be pushing log entries or whether something should be pulling log entries. I was not sure how to answer that. Which approach is better? What are the tradeoffs?\n\nI was also asked how to correlate posts from the same microservices together. I was asked how to design a system that would allow me to search log entries that came from different microservices in the event that useful data about an issue was spread across those different microservices.\n\nMy answer: The microservices would write the log entries to files on its own dedicated directory on disk. Each log entry would be assigned a unique ID like a randomly generated UUID. There would be something that picks up those files and sends them to the distributed logger, so this would be a pull system. To search log entries from the different microservices, I'd merge all the log entries together somehow.\n\nI didn't do well on the question because I couldn't go into depth on how this would work.

Now that we are creating our application to make events more visible, some of the backend features aren't cooperating when we artificially create problems that may or may not occur(if you leave it as is everything works fine). This often leads us to butting heads and it got pretty bad last week.  \n\nThe 2 non-developers on our team always complain about the developers not communicating with them, but they are too focused on what's not working according to what the acceptance criteria/test case is. I understand where they are coming from but I feel like we spend too much effort trying to solve these problems that should rarely happen, if ever. And this sets us back on other problems.  \n\nI don't want to go against them but I feel like I need to tell them that everything I'm doing is fine, but my words of choice are always garbage...

(Perhaps this is arbitrary, but I wanted to be detailed in my description.)\n\n____________________________________________________________\nI'm very new to all of this, so thank you for your time.\n\nI haven't used Reddit much, but I lurk subreddits like these to find helpful advice sometimes.",

I am especially interested in machine learning and AI. However, I got into programming too late (had my first programming class in last quarter of 2nd year), and so by the time I graduate this year, I would only be able to take enough classes to get a minor in CS. \n\nI feel that with a minor I am at a big disadvantage already. Furthermore, my GPA (3.52) is considered decent for my major (average is 2.8), but bad against CS major (average is 3.2) at my school, at least. But if I only count CS related classes, my average is 3.84. Is there a way for me to specify these circumstances?\n\nFor my minor, I tried to only choose classes that were considered important, so I was able to take classes on these topics:\n\n-Matlab/C/C++\n-Data structures\n-Databases\n-Programming Languages (java, lisp ,prolog, etc)\n-Operating System\n-Assembly Language\n-Discrete Math\n-Algorithm Design and Analysis\n-Compilers\n\nI also did research on image processing and got a paper from it, so I think that should help. However, I feel that most schools would simply not consider me because of not having a CS major or high enough GPA. What are the chances of getting into a good grad school in my situation? Also, are there any recommendations for professors/departments on machine learning/AI to check out?",

He told me the things that he did and how much he was getting paid that I figured I'd better go into this thing because I knew I had a passion for computers. Gaming, just being able to look up configurations for wi-fi/dial up settings as a kid. It wasn't until my senior year of college that I decided to pursue this. \n\nOne quarter before finishing my BA, I took a semester off from my UC, and decided to take computer science classes in my local community college. I got straight A's in Java, C, Unix, SQL. The classes weren't that hard for me, but to be honest nothing actually clicked until about 2 months ago as I work for my current company.\n\nAs I was driving home today, I started to realize the many benefits that Web Development had for me and I felt like I needed to share this.\nThe more I read documentation, code and seeing patterns, the more I saw those things in my own life. \nI am not one of those code for 16 hours a day type of person, although I felt like I went through a phase doing that, but I enjoy so much going into work looking at problems and being around people that have the same mindset.\n\nWhat I realized, and is true in life, is that there is more than meets the eye when you program.\nWith going into Web Development, it forces you to think critically and analytically about problems before going into it. \n\nI see so many 'I have a ComSci degree but can't find a job posts here and all I am encouraging is for you guys to keep trying.\nAlso, getting a job is better than having no job at all because what I learned is that there are things that 'clicked' for me at my job without me even realizing it when I was there the first few months.\n\nSo this post is just a gratitude post that I just needed to share.

            "selftext": "Hey all,\n\nI wanted to ask this question here in hopes of finding any personal experience with the subject matter at hand. So, firstly, here's the setup:\n\nCompany \"A\" - My current, contract employer. This employer stations me at company \"B\" to do IT work currently. I never see any representatives from this company, and have only had contact through email. They sign my paychecks and technically am an employee of theirs.\n\nCompany \"B\" - This company is where I go to work every day and am stationed at. This company is a big name and employs many contractors through many other contracting companies. Some of these contractors eventually become full-time employees of company \"B,\" with seemingly no issues.\n\nCompany \"C\" - My prospective company. I just received an offer from these guys not too long ago, and I absolutely want to accept due to it being in a field I'm interested in, and the pay is fantastic. **They also happen to be a contractor for company \"B,\" but in a completely different field** (Actually CS related). But there is one small caveat... \n\nI have a current non-compete agreement that I signed for Company A. The non-compete agreement is relatively small, only asking for being separated from \"The Company\" for 30 days before working for \"The Customer (B) or the Customer's customer (C).\" \n\nMy main question here is what do I do? I want to ask  someone in HR for company A, but I don't want to get fired immediately, as I'd have to wait for a start date that may not be for a while, and I have bills. I also don't want to ask company C or inform them, in fear of getting my offer revoked...\n\nHas anyone dealt with something like this before? I don't know if I should \n\nA. Ignore the non-compete, and hope that my current employer just doesn't care (implied by a current employee) or\n\nB. Inform company C, and run the risk of getting my offer revoked.\n\nThanks for reading this guys.",

            "selftext": "I was contacted by someone about a backend web dev opportunity at the company he works for. He is one of the heads of the company's engineering department, overseeing dozens of developers. The company itself is medium-large about 200 software engineers, and 500+ employees total. Afterwards he let me know that there will be a coding test that every candidate needs to take. It has no hard time limit.\n\nThe coding test itself is to write an app. This is for a mid-level developer position. I don't know whether this is too detailed or not to actually be a real project but here it goes. Long read ahead:\n\n***** \n\nBackground\n\nThe Ordering and Catering department at [company] provides snacks daily in all [company] offices. These snacks are purchased monthly and rotated daily to give employees a variety of choices throughout the month. Some snacks are always purchased, but other snacks vary depending on the mood of the purchaser. The department is open to new snack ideas from employees.\n\nExpected Audience\n\nThe end users of this application will be the employees of the headquarters in [city]. The majority of these users prefer Google Chrome for a web browser. It can be assumed that each employee will consistently use their own computer with the same browser to access the application from the company headquarters.\n\nProject Definition\n\nThis project is to develop a prototype application for the [city] office that allows employees to \nparticipate in choosing the snacks to be purchased for a particular month. The application will have three pages: Voting, Suggestions, and Shopping List.\n\nVoting\n\nThe Voting page will show the snacks currently being purchased or suggested to purchase for the coming month. This should consist of two separate lists: those that are always purchased and those that have been suggested so far this month by employees. Each of the suggestions should display the current number of votes for that snack this month and the last time the snack was purchased. They should also have a vote button that allows an employee to vote for a snack. Once their vote has been entered, the employee cannot change their vote. Employees can vote for up to 3 snacks per month. The number of votes remaining for the employee should be displayed on the page. If an employee attempts to vote more than the allowed number of times, an error message indicating that they may not vote until the next month should be prominently displayed.\n\nYou should use cookies to track whether an employee has used their maximum number of votes. You may assume that every employee always accesses the system from the same browser/device and does not regularly clear their cookies. Snacks which are always purchased should not display the number of votes, the last time purchased, or have a vote button.\n\nSuggestions\n\nThe Suggestions page will display a dropdown box from which an employee may select a snack to add to the list of suggested snacks for the month. The set of optional snacks returned by the web service described below should be used as the source for the items in this menu. This dropdown should not include snacks which are always purchased or snacks which have already been suggested this month. There should also be a textbox that allows an employee to suggest a snack and additional fields indicating where it can be purchased if their preferred snack is not listed in the dropdown. Employee suggestions should be added via the web service as optional snacks for future consideration and added to this month's suggestion list if successfully added via the web service.\n\nAn employee may only choose one snack from the list or enter a new snack, not both, per month. Once the employee chooses or enters their suggestion, they will click the Suggest button to record their suggestion. The application should ensure that duplicate suggestions are not entered. If a new suggestion is offered, the location to purchase it is required. Error messages should be prominently displayed if the employee attempts to make more than the allowed number of suggestions per month, attempts to make a duplicate suggestion, or does not enter all required data when making their \nsuggestion.\n\nShopping List\n\nThe Shopping List page is intended to be used by the department to generate a shopping list for the month. It should display up to 10 snacks, based on current voting records, that would be purchased for this month according to the following rules: 1. Choose all snacks that are always purchased. 2. Choose as many snacks as necessary from the current month votes to make up to ten total snacks for purchase in vote order. Snacks with more votes are preferred over snacks with fewer votes. The shopping list should display the name of the snack and where the snack can be purchased.\n\nWeb Service\n\nAs part of a previous project we developed a web service that allows access to the current list of snack foods to choose from, whether those snacks are always purchased or optional, how many times that snack has been purchased in the past, where the snack can be purchased, and the last date that the snack was purchased. This web service provides data in JSON format. It requires an API key to be provided with every request. The web service allows you to get access to the current list of snacks- any that are always purchased or ones that have been previously suggested. The web service also offers the ability to create a new snack entry. The web service does not track votes for snacks but does track the last time a snack was purchased and it's location. You can assume that there is another administrative application that the department uses to manage this data. Detailed documentation on the web service can be found at [company URL].\n\nThis web service gets taken down periodically for maintenance. In the event that the web service is down, you should provide suitable messaging to the employee so they know to come back at a time when the web service is working.\n\n*****\n\nSo that's most of the description. Is it too descriptive to be reasonable? Is this veering too much into spec work territory?",

Recently, with the logic design class, I started liking hardware stuff (I didn't really like them before).\n\nWe're getting to a point where we might have to decide between picking hardware-centered or software centered subjects. I'm thinking that I can probably learn whatever is taught on the software side by myself (with a bit more studying of course), whereas hardware would be more difficult to study alone. \n\nThat said, I'm considering picking hardware, but I am skeptical.

So I've been searching for job offerings, but I find myself overwhelmed by the requirements posted in these offerings. I'm afraid that I \"only\" know PHP, that my DBA knowledge isn't \"enough\" and that what I've been doing is so basic that I won't be able to correctly do whatever I'm tasked to do in a \"real development environment\", so I end up not even considering myself good enough to even apply in fear of not being capable of taking a test exam during the interview.\n\nSo, my question is, what should I do in order to become confident about my skills and knowledge?

So the first one is under the name tag business analyst but it's a normal coding job, where they give a certain modules of a project to be completed under a certain time although there's a team more often you'd have separate modules and would have to work alone, language is free of choice there, all they care about is that module is complete and that it's working. I know in detail about it is because one of my friend already works there. This company is sort of 10 years into the market.\n\nNext one is an internship offer, salary almost half of the previous one. The job I was told is basically the head will be picking up a technology that he thinks will be good in the future, i.e. the next big hit and I'll be asked to learn it and prepare POCs(proof of concepts) and explain it to him and maybe work on a product if something sparks along the way. Again I'll only be working alone. No matter how big the team is, which currently only consists of two, we still will be working on different technologies. The company has a separate department where they train big corporates employees of how they can adopt to new technologies. I think my work will mostly be used for that. This one is a startup type, which isn't looking to build a bigger team but just a smarter one.\n\n\n\nWhy I am confused is because if I take the former, I get to an understanding of how a real world project altogether works. The design principles problems that arise and how different ends of the systems meet. Whereas in the second one I get to learn continuously new technologies but I don't know how far in depth will I be learning. Plus I'm sort of pessimistic about the real world implementation knowledge that I'll acquire which I talked about the former. So I'm confused on how to begin my career in CS!",

The owner is actually a ex-lead developer turned architect but he wanted to pursue his hobby of photography and made a business out of it. It didn't turn out so well. The company always faced budget problems, and sometimes our checks all came late. He decided to hire a bookkeeper about a few months in, but I didn't stay much longer than that. My job was mainly to maintain their website's internal sales tracking app that dealt with managing photo orders and payments to freelance photographers.\n\n**Second company:** \n\nWeb development agency in the city that made websites for all sorts of clients. Mostly e-commerce but we get other businesses for clients such as media studios and law firms. It's pretty much how you'd expect- a shop making basic corporate sites using WordPress and Magento mostly and I didn't feel like I really pushed things forward to improve revenue. The company wasn't really struggling but wasn't really growing either.\n\n**Third company:** \n\nWeb startup developing a SaaS product that wanted to get in on cloud services. This was the most complex app development work I've done so far. It was a pretty good learning experience but I still didn't have much say in how the app should be made. The app itself was written in JavaScript in a most outdated way- no front-end frameworks, and no code that takes advantage of reusable modules. I wasn't successful in pushing for major code overhaul. It was designed by a senior developer who lives in Eastern Europe and communication with him is minimal.\n\nSo that's how it's been. Was I just not curious or aggressive enough to push for changes?

I\u2019ll list what I\u2019ve learned at the end of this post. I already got three offers lined up but I still feel bad for what happened. I wish I could go to my manager to figure out what I could of done differently and get some feedback but he\u2019s not a very approachable person. I believe this was one reason that led up to this situation; that and I\u2019m kind of a shy person.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**Here is the story (long read):**\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nThe first few months were awesome and this place got debugging tools that would be a developer\u2019s wet dream. Well, sort of, the tools were definitely better than what I worked with in my previous job. I was actually being productive and feeling pretty good. I was learning the code and made my first bug fix on the 2nd week. Soon I was averaging about 1-2 bugs a week, some were actual code fix while others were non-issues,  mis-configurations, or duplicates.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nMy first month review came back good and I told my manager that I can work on something a bit more involved so I got a very small feature (more like an enhancement). I asked if there is anything I can improve on work-wise, he said no. So I started scoping the enhancement. This enhancement required me to understand more of the control-flow and to work someone from another team. My mentor told me the location of some code I will need to understand since it was his feature I was enhancing and a way to approach this. My manager also made a suggestion, lets pretend he suggested steps A B C D and A was the hardest part, but he told us he\u2019ll leave the designing up to us. My mentor and I agreed to do the easy parts first (B C D) instead, then finish A later (get the low hanging fruits). \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nSo I started work, asking questions when I have them, etc. Then came the first status update and I told my manager I am done with B C D, but A I am still working on. He got a little ticked and said I should of done it his way (A B C D) since he felt A was the hardest thing it should have been done first that way if problems show up we can address them early. I told him you left the designing up to me and in the end result would be the same. He told me he\u2019s heard that before and if I had followed his advice this would be completed already. I didn\u2019t want to argue with him over \u2018what if\u2019s\u2019 so the meeting ended and I went back to work on A. \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nAfter A was done I schedule another review meeting. The enhancement was working but my manager didn\u2019t like some of the code and asked why I didn\u2019t enhance it while I\u2019m at it. I told him that wasn\u2019t part of this features requirements and that the code in question belonged to the other team. He didn\u2019t want to hear my explanation, but I told him since it was code from the other team I thought they would have properly tested it since it\u2019s been used for so long. He said I was being too cautious. I didn\u2019t want to argue so I threw in this (additional) enhancement and coordinated with the other team so I won\u2019t break anything.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nThe project got finished on-time and there were only two bugs that QA found that I promptly fixed. I asked my manager \u201cAt least we got it in on time so things are okay, right?\u201d he said \u201cyes it\u2019s okay but I am still upset you didn\u2019t do it my way.\u201d I asked him isn\u2019t the end result the most important and he agreed but asked how I would feel if I gave someone a suggestion but they ended up doing it another way. Okay, whatever, don\u2019t want argue here again.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nIt was right around the time when I was putting the finishing touches on my enhancement I was given another project. This one a bit bigger and more involved. Again, need to learn new code that even my manager and director feel is a bit complicated. I was given 3-months to complete this. I was told two other features will depend on mine so I was on the critical path but they were due 2-months after mine was.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nI started scoping two weeks in after finishing up my first enhancement. I talked to my manager who was the only person senior enough to understand the highlevel and there were no documentation on this new feature. He gave me a high level, explained some of the APIs I needed to know, etc. I asked him since the features that will use mine doesn\u2019t exist yet, how will I test. He said just hardcode something to test it. I decided to just do everything his way this time. I had another meeting with him to talk about how I should write the first draft of the functional specification (FS). He said since I was new that I should just write/play around with the code to get an understanding before writing the FS.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nI created my own testbed and started playing with the existing code to understand who calls what, set breakpoints, use the debugger to see the backtrace, etc. Got a pretty good understanding on how everything should work. Then my director came and added an additional use case which made things a bit more complicated. I wrote a rough draft of the FS and had a review meeting with my manager, he told me it looked fine.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nI continued with my work, asking questions here and there, etc. No one else, other than my manager/director had a clear idea how this should work because there was no documentation from PM or anyone. I guess it\u2019s because it\u2019s still a small feature. Eventually I got my code working, but my director came and told me he wanted something else. He wanted me to test using a feature that was newly implemented in a previous release. FUCK. So I started working and asking questions again. This  time I involved the person who implemented the feature I was suppose to use for my testing. \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nEventually, I figured out what need to be done using what APIs so I updated my FS and schedule a review with my team.  This is maybe 2-months in so I had a month left. I walked through the FS, explaining the highlevel, code-flow, what APIs I will be using. No one had a question and I got the green-light to present to the other teams (QA, people who will use my feature, etc). Did the final presentation, had a few questions that I answered but mostly were wish-list stuff the other teams want.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nAround this time we moved to a new site so I pretty much lost two-weeks because the lab was down. No one told me the lab was going to be down for this long or that I wouldn\u2019t be able to work on my testbed. No extension were given so I was under a lot of pressure when everything was back up. Later on, every project that was due on the same date as mine were given a two week extension including mine,  but my feature was still not working. Throughout this whole time I\u2019ve been continuously asking questions but was just told to go read the code or use this API to do X. I felt my manager was getting annoyed. Soon I had a debugging session with manager, director, and one teammate and they made some suggestions I should try. Still didn\u2019t work so had another meeting the next day. This time they went deeper into my code and asked me to talk them through it. I did and my manager/director said the API I was using and the logic were all wrong.  I tried to tell them I went over this logic/API three times in the FS reviews (got a paper-trail)  but my manger cut me off, told me to stop talking and instead just focus on the problem at hand. Even my teammate felt I wasn\u2019t wrong in using the API I choose.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nOnly a week left but we finished getting only enough done to not block the other features from progressing. The director did most of the work since he know the codebase more than I did. I did testing and contributed where I could.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**End of story. (thanks for reading)**\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nRight now I have the feeling my manager/director feels I totally fucked things up. My bug fixing also feel behind because I was so focused on getting this feature done so all the bad stuff kind of snowballed. But I feel I was led down the wrong path since no one said anything during the FS reviews so I was pretty much debugging something that would of never worked.  It was around the time the 2-week extension was given I felt I wasn\u2019t a good fit here. The interactions during the debug session only made the writing on the wall more clear so I decided it\u2019s time to go. \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nHere\u2019s what I learned:\n\n* Grill the crap out of the recruiter/hiring manager before accepting the position.\n\n* Most people don\u2019t pay attention during meetings, make sure they are clear on what you\u2019re doing and everyone come to an informed consensus.\n\n* Cover your ass at all times\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nmy question is:\n\n* Does this justify quitting or am I being too paranoid?\n\n* Is there anything I could of done differently?\n\n* I\u2019d like to say this was a management issue but there are three other people under him and they are doing fine. So is it me?\n\n* I felt like I could of asked more questions but I really didn\u2019t know what I don\u2019t know. I could ask them to hold my hand but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the reason I got hired. Anyone else have this issue?\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nEDIT: Formatting/grammar.",

I am humbly seeking help from those with more experience who can share their wisdom.\n\nI currently have a job at a big corporation working 9-10hr days with 2 hours of driving each day. I've been at it for a little over a year and I'm fairly content. Some days I love it, but other days it's a chore. It's always stressful. I'm continuously told I should take on less work each sprint, but it seems like during planning, really important things come up that I feel like I have to take on for things to go smoothly for the team/company. I've been told I'm doing pretty well and have a bright future there, but it is a constant struggle to stay at the top of my game. I have a lot of higher-ups here supporting me and wanting me to succeed. There are a lot of layoffs happening, but I don't believe I'll be hit.\n\nI recently got a call from an old internship employer asking me to come work for him. I originally didn't take on a full-time with him because of location, but he's now offering remote work. This place is the complete opposite of the big corporation. Extremely small to the point that my manager is really just the CEO himself and I would make up a third of the development force. They make multimedia applications. If I work here, I would be pretty autonomous due to faith in the work I provided during my internship. There wouldn't really be anybody watching over me (which could lead to me growing bad coding habits!).\n\nHere are the pros to each:\n\nStartup:\n\n\n- No commute\n\n\n\n- More free time to pursue life/coding interests (probably 9 hour days, no commute)\n\n\n\n\n- No more stressful agile deadlines. \n\n\n\n\n- Autonomy (this is a pro and con really.. who am I going to learn from?)\n\n\n\n\n- Daily programming. Daily technical challenges, but of less magnitude\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate:\n\n\n- Stable future\n\n\n\n\n- Career growth (I feel like other employers in the future would like it more)\n\n\n\n\n- People to review my code and fix my bad habits!\n\n\n\n\n- Greater technical challenges (by far), but more sparse (lots of config and plumbing work)\n\n\n\n\n- People to look to for help if I get stuck\n\n\n\n\n\nIn terms of money, the startup pays 15k more in salary, but the corporation makes up for it in stocks/bonuses so they come out to be about even.\n\nHere are my concerns with moving to the startup:\n\n\n- If the company goes under in 18 months, will it look really bad that I worked 14 months at one place and 18 months at another?\n\n\n- Will I be able to learn as much doing more coding, but having to do it/review it on my own?\n\n\n- Will my salary/position be too high to match my skills/experience (I would be making 115k salary being only a year and a half out of school..)\n\n\n\nI have been fretting over this decision for almost a week. I'm not sure what would be better for my career. I would certainly be more relaxed with the startup, perhaps much happier, but I'm worried what it might set me up for in the future.

            "selftext": "Let me give you guys some background...\n\nI took a computer science class freshman year and solving those difficult problems with coding made me fall in love. It felt so satisfying finding the solutions! (Btw I was doing basic coding on a website called Scratch) \n\nMy Sophomore year I joined the MESA club (Robotics club) and I was also exposed to some coding there which was the VEX coding language (RobotC) and I was also exposed to Labview. There I learned how to program robots on my own since I barely had any mentors to teach me the code. It was just me and the internet. It was still fun solving those bugs I ran into and I loved whenever I ran into a \"DUH\" moment.\n\nI also had a Game design class where I was exposed to Gamesalad, a program that is in a way similar to Scratch but focuses a lot on making games. I worked with my friend thats an amazing artist and we made a pretty cool game that we showed off near the end of 2nd semester for that year. It wasn't a FANCY game but I still felt proud of it.\n\nThat same year I also got an Internship at some local private company that wanted us to make a game using the 'Stencyl' Language. It was just me and some other guy (that barely did any work) do all the programming on the game. Everything from collisions, player movement, enemies and even UI. Again, it was fun but I really wished someone taught me the ways of coding in Stencyl. I was just thrown in there to learn a language, use my background knowledge and use the internet to make a game in under 2 months.\n\nThroughout high school I made just a few more games that were a part of some projects for my math class but nothin special. I was just using what I already knew and the games were very simple.\n\nAnd now we come to today. I'm in my final year of high school and boy am I scared. I've been scrolling through this subreddit and there are so many things that excite me but scare me at the same time. I'm scared that maybe this isn't for me because i've been doing only simple coding and the harder coding would overwhelm me but then at the same time i'm excited to learn new things, especially when i'm being taught and not left alone to teach myself. I'm really excited about programming so should I major in CS for college or is there another major specifically for programming? Is what i've been doing in high school the right way to become a Computer Scientist? How hard is CS? Should I just not do college at all and go for bootcamps? Would I have to worry about not being able to get a job in the future? I just don't want to end up a failure with a bunch of student loan debit working a minimum wage job all because I didn't plan my future out correctly.",

I'm now looking for software engineering positions away from my hometown but as a person who only completed a CS minor and not a major, I feel like I'm having a harder time getting through some of the common technical interview questions that ask stuff about algorithms or data structures.\n\nUltimately I think I'd like to do something that makes use of my math background such as cryptography, big data/machine learning, or statistics but from what I've seen most of the jobs in these areas require at least a Master's so I would likely need to go back to school. The problem with that is I'm completely broke, have a lot of student loan debt, I'm burnt out from school in general, and I have no idea what graduate program would be best for me.\n\nI know that a lot of pure math grad programs will cover tuition and even pay you a stipend through fellowships and assistantships, but it seems to me that a CS grad degree would be more practical for the fields I'm interested in and I'm not sure that those same benefits are as common for CS programs. Most programs also have a CS bachelor's preference or at least require specific undergrad classes which I have not completed such as a hardware/architecture related course and OS/programming languages. Is it possible to take these classes on their own without enrolling in a 4 year program at a university?\n\n**tl;dr:** I have a math degree with a CS minor but I feel like I lack some of the CS knowledge required to get through a lot of entry level software engineering interview questions. What do I do?",

I'll cover more in the next videos. \n\nI'm very glad that this will be of value to you. I plan to go into more data structures and algorithms in the next videos, but I also want your feedback. \nSo please comment on the video about:\n- What you liked about the video\n- What you learned or found interesting\n- What other problems you'd like to see\n\nAlso feel free to criticize, that's how we learn :)\n\nI have put in a good amount of effort to make it high quality. So I would love to see it benefit a lot more people. So **here is my request to you:**\nPlease share this video right now with at least one person that you think would benefit.

I found this subreddit about three years ago and I thought I would just use it once or twice for help getting an internship. Instead I have visited nearly every single day, posted my resume at least twenty five times and asked dozens of questions ranging from interview prep to company reputations. I have also collected dozens of super helpful links that are still on my bookmark bar, like [this excel sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1z3_OfZdPXiOOgHi7uY5nvLuQX_qbpaxmYNXHHiuuV0I/edit#gid=0), [intern.supply](http://www.intern.supply/), and this [massive cheat sheet](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/5gr8nw/heres_a_sanitized_list_of_530_free_online/).\n\n\nI was never able to obtain an internship before graduating despite hundreds of applications and a handful of interviews but the preparation I did for these helped me later on for full-time interviews. It was really hard seeing everyone else obtain their 3rd or 4th internship and receive full-time offers several months before graduating while I was stuck doing manual labor over the summers for minimum wage. I suffered severe depression from the beginning of my Sophomore year until about a month ago and my sliding grades and poor interview performances were a few symptoms of that. I kept checking out my classmates on LinkedIn and the salary sharing threads here and kept feeling sorry for myself until I realized I just needed to keep improving instead of worrying about what other people thought of me. I felt so monumentally insecure going into interviews because I felt like I was always the weakest candidate because of my lack of experience.\n\nI also kept a folder on my email titled \"rejections\" because I was just getting so fucking many. I kept adding and adding to it because I wanted to look back on the day when I would get my first offer and see all of the hard work I've done. I do not recommend this.\n\n\nEventually after many hours of interview practice, dozens of hackerrank questions, reading CTCI front-to-back, a significant personal project and a one and a half month post-graduation internship I finally have my first offer. I didn't make this because I want to brag or anything, I just want to thank the contributors for all of their generous help and to provide some reassurance to those still struggling. If you work hard enough you will eventually succeed. Just keep at it.\n\nThank you all so very much, I would not be in this position without you.\n",

But as noted in the Twitter comments, diminishing returns hits *hard* in an intellectual activity like software engineering; even after just the 60 hour mark, code becomes sloppy.

I did not have the capacity for analysis, the minutiae, or the interest and passion of my coworkers.\n\nWhen I asked him what my strong suit was, he visibly struggled to find an answer.  It finally amounted to: \"You're a really nice person.\"  Definitely not something I can put on my CV without getting laughed out of the room.\n\nWith that, I was handed the HR paperwork, given a bit of shut-up money, and sent on my merry way.\n\nAnd now I'm on the job market, needing to somehow start over and find a place that'll accept my mediocrity.  It's hard to smile at recruiters when you feel like damaged goods on the inside.\n\nI guess from here on out, it's not Reddit that I need, but a psychologist.",
