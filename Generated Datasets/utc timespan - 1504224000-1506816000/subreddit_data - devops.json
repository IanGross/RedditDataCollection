The problem is, our application is dependent on a number of 3rd party services, some of which send webhooks to our servers to facilitate some crucial functionality. These services include:\n\nPushed (web sockets) \nFirebase (push notifications)\nA couple small 3rd party services that rely on webhooks. \n\nAs such, while the developers can write code locally and run tests, they can't really try out their work without deploying to staging. \n\nHow do companies handle this sort of situation?  The only other thing I can think of is to create a \"dev\" cluster on AWS where each developer can have their own docker-compose setup, and maybe rsync from their local box, to this remote one.  This way, they could have access to all the 3rd party services and receive webhooks. \n\nI'm also hesitant to do this because each dev already has a local setup, and so this adds yet another environment. \n",

So I'm constantly having to login to their console account, find the server I want to connect to, figure out what key to use, see if I have to use a bastion host, etc. It's a pain when you do this multiple times a day.\n\nSo, I've started working on a side project written in Electron and Vue to make life a little easier.\n\nIt's in the early dev phase, and is being developed on a Mac so take that into consideration.\n\nIn a nutshell it allows you to add multiple aws organizations then per region access keys to run the \"ec2:describeInstances\" command. Scan for ssh keys needed by the servers, import said ssh keys. List out the instances in a region and quickly connect via ssh, while using a bastion host if needed.\n\nI haven't actually built a distributable app, because it's still under constant development, but if you have node available, you should be able to run it locally.\n\nI'm just posting this here because I thought people might find it useful, and it might help me crush some design issues or just usability issues early in the dev process.\n\nhttp://ricktbaker.com/2017/09/29/devops_helper/",

            "selftext": "Tuesday the 26th of September, a morning a bit different than the most for me, I was very excited because I had been up all weekend working on my newest project, Reddit Grid, and it was about to go live! I booted up my google analytics and started to share it in a few facebook groups and subreddits to gather feedback and add the features that was requested.\n\nThe initial feedback was that the app was great, but there were a few core features missing, which I quickly added. Around 13:00 CEST I had finished enough of the core features and went over to Hacker News to show off my baby in the \u201cShow HN\u201d category.\n\nRight away I could see that people were heading over by looking the source of my visitors in Google Analytics, it went from roughly 15 users to 35-50 going up and down. I was very happy that people actually wanted to check out what I had made. I went to grab some food and came back around 14:30 and opened up my Analytics. I was shocked. I was looking at a number, I was sure was an error, and refreshed the page. Nope, it was real. I was sitting at 165 concurrent users, using my app right at this moment.\n\nFull article: https://mereommig.dk/en/blog/how-i-survived-going-viral-on-a-5-linode",

I'm currently working on getting an ALB working with HTTPS.\n\nWe have a few containers running on ECS (Docker) which are on a private subnet, meaning they're inaccessible directly. We have an ALB in front of them which provides a way to access these services anyway. I have them all running on HTTP (so, port 80), including the ALB.\n\nMy question: we obviously want to use HTTPS, however is it worth the hassle of using HTTPS for the Docker containers as well? So, in other words, should internal communication (with NO access to the outside world) ALSO be HTTPS, in addition to the ALB?\n\nTo make my question even more clear, **this is what we have at this moment**:\n\nServices <-- 80 --> ALB <-- 80 --> Browser\n\nWe want to have a secure webserver. Would the following suffice?\n\nServices <-- 80 --> ALB <-- 443 --> Browser\n\nOr is it strongly recommended to do this? :\n\nServices <-- 443 --> ALB <-- 443 --> Browser\n\nThanks for your time!",

            "selftext": "Sorry for the newbie post - I was a C programmer (systems and networking) for 7-8 years, switched to Python and a SaaS product a year and half ago so new to the whole game, and getting overwhelmed with all the tools/products.\n\nI have certain events I'm logging. In some cases they are simply that an event took place (for example, a RabbitMQ/AMQP notification or that a function was invoked). In other cases, they measure how long some event took to complete (for example, a blocking RabbitMQ call, an REST API call, a function/loop iteration, a DB read/write).\n\n\nFor example, I might have the logs:\n\n    (time = 12:00)\n    <timestamp> RPC_func1: elapsed = 40.4 seconds\n    <timestamp> DB_read_data: elapsed = 10 sec\n    <timestamp> FN_delete event\n    <timestamp> FN_delete event\n    ...\n    <timestamp> RPC_func1: elapsed = 33.7 sec\n    <timestamp> DB_read_data: elapsed = 2.5 sec\n    <timestamp> FN_delete event\n    ...\n    <timestamp> RPC_func1: 50 sec\n    <timestamp> DB_read_data: 15 sec\n    ...\n    (time = 12:09:59)\n\n\nI have 3 metrics: RPC_func1, DB_read_data, and FN_delete. I was originally planning on using logster (developed by etsy, same folks who did statsd), a log tailing utility that aggregates data from log files, aggregating stats from last time it was invoked: https://github.com/etsy/logster\n\nI modified their MetricParser's regex and some logic to work with our log files, it aggregates stats into time series data. For the RPC/DB times, I can compute the mean/median/percentiles . For FN_delete I can just record that it occured X times. This might run as a cronjob every 10 min, or I might run it manually before/after I perform some kind of benchmark test. \n\n**I already have this working**.  I'm using Logster's stdout plugin to re-direct to another logfile. For example, here's a snippet for how long a VM spawn times, with timestamp:\n\n    cat <otherlogfile where we redirect stdout from logster>:\n    1503603001 spawn.num_count 17\n    1503603001 spawn.mean 56.36\n    1503603001 spawn.median 49.55\n    1503603001 spawn.90th_percentile 80.70\n    1503603001 spawn.95th_percentile 85.65\n    ...\n    1503603602 spawn.num_count 6\n    1503603602 spawn.mean 24.78\n    1503603602 spawn.median 20.035\n    1503603602 spawn.90th_percentile 37.025\n    1503603602 spawn.95th_percentile 40.025\n\nI also do keep track of every individual event's values in a list, but not outputting it for now (i'm just eyeballing the output to see aggregated metrics). \n\nBut that's not very useful. I need some kind of consolidated storage and visualization. Logster already has a built-in graphite output plugin, SO I was thinking of using Graphite to store and visualize the metrics: https://graphiteapp.org/\n\n\nBut I read that graphite is quite old now and not that good? The ELK Stack seems to be the most popular. I feel like for my use case, I could just skip Logstash altogether, and send the data directly to Elasticsearch since it has a REST API? Or I could use Logster's built in Graphite plugin and modify it to send to Logstash instead, and use Logstash's Unix Socket input plugin?\n\nI've been hearing about other tools like using InfluxDB + Grafana, Graphite + Grafana (since Graphite's UI is apparently clunky).\n\n\nThis is NOT going to be used for a production environment. More just in-house benchmarking. I just need something that's easiest to set up and get me going. I'm still relatively new to Databases and web apps, i've never set anything up like this myself.

Switching around between all of the different docs for backends and the actual APIs to put together a comprehensive guide for using Vault for our developers.\n\nOne question I have: what is the best way to handle Vault secret backend mounts?\n\nThe way I have started to set this up is basically: for each application, there will be X number of mounts depending on how many different types of secret backends the application will use. For example, a standard application will always have a \"generic\" secrets backend, as well as an \"aws\" secrets backend mounted.\n\nSo each application will have:\n\n* app/<app-name>/dev/secrets/ (generic)\n* app/<app-name>/dev/aws/ (aws) \n* etc....\n\nThen I give each application (to start) 2 policies, 1 RO, and 1 RW. They grant access to the \"app/<app-name>/dev/*\" path.\n\nI like the idea of having actual mounts for each application because it gives me an easy way to see which applications are set up in vault and makes it easier to delete an entire mount, if needed, which would only impact 1 app instead of a much larger set of secrets.\n\nIs this too much overhead? Should I be doing a fewer amount of actual mounts and just using naming/paths under those mounts to set up secrets for each application?\n\nThanks!",

However, when it comes to a live deploy we are currently using the dev branch NuGet packages instead of master. Why? because the versioning of the live packages are not flagged with dev and that's what the package.config is expecting. \n\nNow I did think of flagging the package.config for git ignore but this then means that updates wont be received. I then thought about dropping the flag via powershell script before restore. This then runs into the versioning issue of master version then needs to mimic dev but it wont as it's not been built as much.\n\nSo currently the overall issue is that we are using development branch versions of core libraries in live instead of master branch\n\nAnyone got any ideas?

I've also found that it typically provides me enough information to start asking questions, but never enough information to actually answer the question.  \n\n* Data Dog doesn't cover every language we use. \n\n* Sumo Logic is cool if you're invested in it, but every user we tried to on-board stopped using it completely within a week because it was too difficult to understand. \n\n\nRight now most of my monitoring is a combination of New Relic and a Graylog server that might fall over at any time.

If there isn't one today, perhaps one of them has \"goals\" to eventually be a one-stop-shop like I'm looking for. \n\nAppreciate any input, I need to propose a stack to solidify and run with within the next couple weeks so I'm trying to weigh in all input from others. \n\n\n",

For example the queue worker service requires the PHP `pcntl` extension, but that is not needed by the others. The HTTP traffic server is the only one which needs `php-fpm` installed.

This includes some major updates, most notably complete wrapping of the AWS .NET SDK (both .NET45 and .netstandard SDK's included and loaded accordingly on module import).\n\nThis means you can build templates using VaporShell's full coverage of all available AWS resource and property types (including custom resource types, if needed), then package your template and upload dependencies to S3, create your change set and execute it. You can create and delete stacks, change sets, stack sets. You can generate a Simple Calc URL to see an estimated cost of your template. You can watch stack events unfold in full color in a separate window even if you'd like!\n\nCheck out the [GitHub page](https://github.com/scrthq/VaporShell) for more details!\n\n\n\ud835\udcd2\ud835\udcf1\ud835\udcee\ud835\udcee\ud835\udcfb\ud835\udcfc\nNate | SCRT HQ",

We do ALL our work on the Dev servers, and generally as root (I know, I know). TFS houses all our work, python scripts and Splunk config files. As I look everything over I'm weighing breaking that up, keeping the python stuff in TFS (or maybe switching to GitLab) and maintaining our Splunk configs in Ansible. The biggest problem though is the workflow, I'm inclined to move the actual work to local, and then pushing into config management and then into Dev, but I'm not sure we can run Splunk locally on our machines to do so. \n\nAny ideas folks?\n\n",

There are a couple of EC2 instances, where there's a Jenkins Master and Slave.  Currently, they are configured with a simple bash-script in the Userdata section, but I'm going to change that and use Ansible instead.  \n \nNow, what I can't get my head around is the following scenario.  So, you spin up an EC2 instance, you create the users accessing those machines and someone configures software running on that server (take for example Jenkins).  That means that you have a set of fixed components (the server and your Jenkins installation) and a set of variable components (passwords to ssh into the servers, configuration in Jenkins, Jenkins builds, ...)\n\nHow do you handle the case where you change something in your Terraform scripts, that causes a Destroy and Create of that server?  You can't just simply delete everything and recreate it, because there's already a lot of information there.  Snapshotting the instance and then creating it again, based on that snapshot, is dangerous in my opinion, as you don't know if something went in to configure a setting, without updating the Ansible scripts.\n\nIs it simply an exercise of finding out what the variable components are, and putting them somewhere else (DB, EFS, S3, ...).  Or is there more to it than that?\n\nAnd what about users SSH'ing into that machine?  Because their passwords are gone.  I would advocate connecting with pub/priv key, as you don't rely on setting up passwords on the machine itself.  \n\nNote: I'm not a systems administrator.  I have a dev background and now I'm focussing more on Cloud (AWS and Azure in particular).",

            "selftext": "Hi guys, looking for some feedback on what approach you use for automating your deployment process (I am on windows). It cannot involve paying a monthly fee for now and I have multiple sites to manage this way.\n\n\nI am building websites on the LAMP stack on my own VPS (todays site deployment is a WordPress site for example) so I obviously have root access. SSH is all set up with a public key and git is installed on the VPS.\nToday I will be deploying from dev > staging > production for the first time using ssh and before I learn an approach I would like your input.\n\n\nMy workflow:\n\n\nI have a private repo for each site hosted with Github and I develop locally on my dev machine (MAMP for Windows / Browsersync). Any changes made locally are pushed to the repo. I am aware of other options such as Vagrant which I have played with but for now I would like to focus on the deployment process unless changing how I develop locally is integral to getting it set up right.\n\n\nI have a domain setup as staging on the VPS to allow my clients to review the site before going live. I currently manually transfer my files and database (and theme settings) from dev to staging with FTP and manually run the search and replace for the database with an sql command in phpmyadmin.\nOnce the site is finalised and signed off I copy it from staging to production and go live (ftp again.)\nObviously I am trying to get a professional workflow going, it's the whole reason I bought a VPS ($2000 per year for one based in my state in Australia).\n\n\nThe goal is any changes made locally to dev get automatically pushed to staging when I commit them to the repo. I would also like to automate copying the database along with a find and replace to change the URL's to the staging domain?\n\n\nWhen the time comes, I want to run a command to push everything from staging > production. I would also like to be able to transfer the db back from production > staging > local for future dev down the track.\nJenkins pipeline seems like a good option but I don't know much about it, before I go knee deep, what do you reckon? I don't want to learn something that's already out of date.\n\n\nI've got all day to get something set up. Looking forward to hearing some suggestions.",

            "selftext": "\nWhen you're working on a side-project or at a startup as part of a small focused team, it can be hard to get away from\nthe heads-down mentality of \"just do it\". But sometimes it can be valuable to step back and recognize that a bit of upfront\ninfrastructure work can save you days or even weeks of time getting your MVP up and running.\n\nThe following are the quick and dirty Devops patterns & procedures that I put in place before working on any new system.\nI primarily focus on free tools and services because of how cheap I am, so feel free to replace them comparable tools of your choice,\nyou big spender, you.\n\n# Before your first line\n- **Store your code in Git** - [Github](https://github.com/) *[free open source]*/[Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) *[free private]* -\nthere shouldn't be more to say here other than, store your source in a VCS from day 1.\n- Design your app with **multiple environments** in mind. You should be able to switch between Local/Stage/Production development\nwith no code changes, just configuration changes (via environmental variables or a config file). I love [nconf](https://github.com/indexzero/nconf)\nfor NodeJS, but most languages have something similar.\n- **Isolate your configuration.** Its probably not necessary to move your configuration into a compeltely separate system yet,\nbut make sure you can easily if you scale. Sprinkling your configuration in multiple places is just asking for an application re-write.\n- **Follow a branching pattern.** At it's simplest it could just be 2 branches, \"master\" and \"develop\" or you could go nuts\nand follow [gitflow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/). It doesn't matter, as long as you follow\nthe damn thing, and don't just commit directly to master. Setup branch protection to disable commits to \"master\".\nThis is going to be important later when you start doing Continuous Integration (CI). Bad habits are hard to break.\n- **Setup CI**. You don't need to go full throttle with a standalone Jenkins server. Just make sure your code is compiling\nin a clean-room environment, that doesn't include the dozens of apps and libraries you already have installed on your\ndev machine. [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/) *[free]* and [CircleCI](https://circleci.com) *[free]* are great, and integrate\nwith Github/Bitbucket. At a bare minimum build your artifacts inside a clean Docker container.\n- Setup an **issue tracker/project management board**. [Waffle.io](https://waffle.io) *[free]* is great and integrates with Github,\nbut you may be able to just get away with [Github Project Boards](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-project-board/) *[free]* to start\n- Make some Architecture decisions:\n\t- Decide if you can get away with a [static frontend](https://github.com/myles/awesome-static-generators) or SPA\n\tarchitecture for your front end. If you can, you'll get infinite scaling of your front-end for almost free.\n\tDistributing static files is a solved problem--CDN's have been doing it for years. [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com) *[free]*\n\tis your ~~cheapest~~ best friend. Pairing it with Github pages [free] is a poor developer's dream.\n\t- Can you go Serverless/FAAS for your backend? You no longer need to maintain or monitor hardware, you get infinite*\n\tscaling out of the box. The tradeoff is that your costs will vary with usage, which can be a good thing for startups.\n\n\n---\n\nYou can read the rest of the post here: [https://blog.thesparktree.com/devops-for-startups](https://blog.thesparktree.com/devops-for-startups)\nI'd love to hear what kind of automation/devops procedures you guys put in place when working on new projects or joining small teams.",

            "selftext": "I'm using HockeyApp for app distribution for a large corporation. We have a core version of the app and manage unique versions for each market.  We have 50+ apps and many hundreds of users. I've found HockeyApp's UI to be somewhat ugly for managing users.   \n\nFor example, we get a new market and I setup dev, QA and release apps for that market for both iOS and Android. I setup a distribution group for the users and add the apps and users to that group. Everyone gets \"tester\" access to the apps by default but most of them need member or developer access. I have to go to the app, click the users, click the app, click manage user, change the setting, click save, click back and do that for each app the user has access to. So if I add a group of 10 users and 6 apps (iOS and Android) it's really cumbersome to give them each developer or member access. I can alternatively give users access to an app directly without going through a group, but then I have to keep track outside of hockeyapp what each user's role is. If a market adds another app, I'd have to go in and manually assign that app to each user and keep track of who should get access. What I want to do is have a group of \"Market XYZ Developers\" and be able to just add an app to the group and give everyone in that group developer access all at once.   \n\nI realize there should probably be some corporate group that handles this, but right now it's me and aside from writing a new UI in my free time that allows me to do bulk updates through the hockeyapp API, I'm doing a lot of manual work. Are there any alternatives to HockeyApp that manage both Android and iOS and also handle user management in a more graceful way?  \n\nedit: my only requirements aside from user management is that it supports iOS and Android and has a Jenkins plugin.",

Theres a rails monolith (with an angular, soon to be replaced by react front end), a few vanilla ruby microservices, and a few rails microservices. So far my idea is to build out 2 new VPC's, one for staging one, and one for prod and just build everything out from there. I figure terraform for infrastructure, bake up ami's for the monolith with ansible/packer, and build a kubernetes cluster for the microservices (the plan is to split out the monolith in short order - so everything would go on k8's then). Monitoring will be prometheus/pingdom/cloudwatch. And use Jenkins to deploy/CI/CD etc...

Shippable offers bigger nodes in the SaaS product, so that is the key for resource intensive builds.\n\n\n3. Shippable offers a unique option called BYON which provides the security of on-premises with the convenience of SaaS.\n\n4. Shippable has a better Docker support. Don't go by my post, try it yourself. \n\n\nTo clarify the first - Shippable can create an end to end CD workflows with approval gates and release management included.\n\n\nTo clarify the fourth - Shippable also provides managed jobs for deployments to container orchestration services like ECS, Kubernetes, azure, etc. which makes configuring deployments incredibly easy and doesn't need extensive scripting.\n\n\n5.

Among the many things that barrier needs to include is some very basic ( OWASP top ten style ignoring any opinions on OWASP ) tests, that act as a sort of baseline minimum bar. Specifically I am interested in web applications and REST APIs in this scenario.\n\nWe use Jenkins internally but use travis-ci for open source stuff. I am interested in both enterprise solutions ( for jenkins ) and open source / free solutions for the Open Source release side. Nessus is kind of lackluster in it's capabilities as is qualys. BDD-Security looks pretty interesting, though. What I'd like, is to be able to walk an app in selenium, or specify an API structure using swagger files. Then, have the testing framework fuzz the application quickly in a PR test, and maybe more exhaustively in a release pipeline QA test. I am thinking of Appscan style testing... but ran from CI/CD with a config file specifying what findings to ignore or set as WARNs versus FAILs.\n\nI assume folks here have engaged in these sorts of 'devsecops' scenarios before. I was hoping someone could shoot me in the right direction, or add some great tools to my list to evaluate as I begin this journey.

Let's say Spring IO Brussels is the only framework endorsed for use in our company. Is there a way to only have those artifacts (as well as its transitive dependencies) available, while still having Artifactory connected to the Maven Central Repo? The idea is that the developers would fetch their (endorsed) dependencies from our internal Artifactory instance, and not from Maven Central (blocked by proxy anyway). We need to find a way to limit artifacts to only those that are endorsed.\n\nAre you working in a secure corporate environment? Please share your setups and best practices.

It's hard for me to study what I want, combining it with my work (which I really do not like).\nLast summer, I was lucky to get tested and get to courses at DevOps in the company EPAM. I studied there for several months. After these courses I precisely understand what I would like to do. But my knowledge was still not enough to go to the next stage of training. The courses were designed for system administrators or programmers who already had experience and to which I still did not relate.\nNow I'm again at a loss, the positive effect on the courses was because of that I made friends with my classmates and we solved all the questions together and helped each other, and for me it's very difficult to do it alone.\n\nCan you please tell me how to proceed correctly?",

What is new is that the cloud is real and here to stay and a LOT of work which involved working hands on with physical devices has moved into data centers which most of us don't control.  The migration to cloud platforms has moved more sysadmin work into the development/automation realm.\n\nHowever, I'm NOT saying you can't do things the \"DevOps Way\" with a local network or data center which you can access.  DevOps does not necessarily involve the cloud.\n\nAlso, despite the buzzwordiness of the term DevOps and the army of consultants, marketers and bandwagoning entrepeneurs who are trying to \"sell DevOps\" without actually understanding what it means, the term has brought new ideas into the collective tech conscience and that's a good thing in many ways.  Names are powerful.  PMs, CTOs, etc now have a term for modern software design and development which they can wrap their heads around.\n\nMy best analogy is the term \"hacker\".  Most lay people equate \"hacker\" with someone who wears dark clothes and types away furiously as they break into government/corporate networks.  But the original tech definition was someone who just like to code a lot and/or someone who used lots of \"hacks\" in their code.  The latter definition has more of a negative tone although brilliant hacks may be celebrated and appreciated in some contexts.\n\nWhen someone says \"DevOps Engineer\" I know what they mean and I can forgive them for not understanding the philosophical weight of the term DevOps.  :)\n\nAlso, Site Reliability Engineer isn't exactly a perfect job title either. . . \"what do you do?\"  \n\n\"Oh, I'm a Site Reliability Engineer\"\n\n\"So you make sure web sites are reliable?\"   \n\n\"Yeah and I help clean up the mess when they're not.\"\n\nI actually prefer Infrastructure Engineer or Cloud Operations Engineer or Cloud Infrastructure Engineer.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Ansible needs the SSH keys to manage them(mostly 1 pair for each machine), and we are planning to store the private key part in Vault. I'm not able to decide between the following 2 approaches:\n\n1. Use the generic secret backend to store the private key and store the \"secret/*\" in the database against the public key. Every time we want to run Ansible, we can lookup in the DB, get the keys and get going. This seems to be straightforward and simple to implement.\n\n2. The SSH backend.

So far, we've settled on:\n\n- Dotnet core for service development (although being language agnostic is somewhat of an end goal)\n- Kafka for message brokering\n- Docker\n- Kubernetes\n- Ansible\n\nWe have a pretty basic proof of concept working, which seems to have ticked all the right boxes with the management team, and is an absolute joy to work with.\n\nMy next task is to investigate options for how the development workflow is actually going to work.  They are already used to working in a CI/CD manner, with some of their newer products using Jenkins/Octopus Deploy (the latter of which the management team has a real boner for).\n\nMy question is:  Do any of you have any firm recommendations for setting up a CI/CD pipeline when deploying to a Kubernetes cluster?\n\nA list of must haves is:\n\n* Multiple environments i.e. Integration, Test, UAT, Staging, Production\n\n* A means through which different business units can uniquely handle deployments to different environments (development can only push to integration, tester into test, etc).  This one is probably their biggest ask - they are used to working with Octopus, and they love the way it handles this.\n\n* The ability to roll back / deploy at the click of a button (or with as few steps as possible).\n\nI've spent the past couple of days looking in to options, of which there are many.\n\nSo far, Jenkins Pipeline seems like it could be a great start.  Spinnakar also seems like a solid choice.  I did read a bit into Fabric8, and while it offers much of what I'm asking, it seems a bit like overkill.\n\nA second question is regarding docker registries.  Do I have all images for all environments in one registry?  Do I have one registry per environment? Is there an option here that I'm maybe not considering?\n\nThank you for your help.",

            "selftext": "I am not in IT or DevOps, but I am in a reporting role which has expanded over time to the point where I am managing the ETL, data warehouse, and visualizations for a large number of accounts. Unfortunately, this means that I have responsibility without having the proper qualifications or experience so I need to learn as I go. \n\nMy current setup is an Azure Ubuntu server which contains:\n\n1. All of my scripts for Airflow (a Python tool from Airbnb) to run ETL tasks, along with the scheduler and webserver\n2. My PostgreSQL database which stores my production data, and has databases for Jupyterhub, Airflow, and Superset metadata\n3. All of the raw input files that I process\n4. My Anaconda environments\n5. Jupyterhub webserver\n6. Superset which is a visualization tool made by Airbnb, also a webserver \n\nI feel like I should separate some of the webserver stuff away from the ETL/database. For example, with Superset or Jupyterhub, if someone does a large query there is a chance for it to mess with my Airflow scheduler. And I may want to spin up smaller Jupyterhub or Superset servers for specific teams / groups which should be basically identical.\n\nCan anyone give me advice about how to go about this as I add new machines in the future? I have heard of Docker, Kubernetes, Mesos, Vagrant, etc. but I truly do not even know if they are applicable or which I should begin researching.\n\nThanks!",

I could install Jenkins on each server to listen for http posts from the build machine (\"deploy artifact with name xyz from shared network folder\"), but I was wondering if jenkins is overkill for that task, i would ideally not like to spend alot of time installing and maintaining Jenkins everywhere\n\nAll I need is a utility that listens for http post messages on each server ,stops services,performs a file unzip and restarts services,and while I could make such a thing, I expect this problem has been solved many times in the devops world?

I booted up my google analytics and started to share it in a few facebook groups and subreddits to gather feedback and add the features that was requested.\n\nThe initial feedback was that the app was great, but there were a few core features missing, which I quickly added. Around 13:00 CEST I had finished enough of the core features and went over to Hacker News to show off my baby in the \u201cShow HN\u201d category.\n\nRight away I could see that people were heading over by looking the source of my visitors in Google Analytics, it went from roughly 15 users to 35-50 going up and down. I was very happy that people actually wanted to check out what I had made. I went to grab some food and came back around 14:30 and opened up my Analytics. I was shocked. I was looking at a number, I was sure was an error, and refreshed the page. Nope, it was real. I was sitting at 165 concurrent users, using my app right at this moment.\n\nFull article: https://mereommig.dk/en/blog/how-i-survived-going-viral-on-a-5-linode",
