The necessities are this: all code is stored on remote servers and never gets stored on the drives of local machines, there is integrated ability to version control (specifically git), and the programming happens inside an IDE.\n\nI have been using Jupyter running on a remote server, then ssh port binding to that instance of Jupyter from my local machine to edit notebooks from a local port, but there is no version control integration with jupyter and git doesn't play nice with .ipybn files. My thoughts now are to mount the remote server to the local machine with sshfs, run pyCharm on my local machine, and access the .py files via the mount, doing version control through pyCharm. So, use .py instead of .ipynb.\n\nIdeally, we would have it set up like RStudio-Server is right now where RStudio is always running from the remote server, we can access it via a browser, log in with our user credentials, and start working with files on the server through the web browser, using git through RStudio. Are there any Python IDEs that allow this remote access via a web browser AND contain a version control system?\n\nTL;DR: Are there any Python IDEs can be run on a server, accessed through a web browser, AND are integrated with git?\n\nThank you so much!\n",

It's known as an expression statement.\n\nStatements can produce a value or values (some kind of value result) that can be stored in a variable, but the statement its self can not be stored in a variable.\n\nFor example you can't do this:\n\nstatementVariable = a = b + c\n\nSo to summarise expressions evaluate to a value, and statements do not evaluate to a value.\n\nIf you have anything to add that you think will help solidify my understanding of these two concepts I would be very grateful.\n\nI hope my understanding is right and I havn't misunderstood everything lol. Hopefully you wizards can either confirm my understanding or guide me as to where my thinking is wrong.\n\nThank you :)",

Each list in the list has 6 elements (0-5) and I'm essentially trying to loop over each nested list and take the two datetime objects in each nested list and get a differential. The issue I'm running into is when my nested for loop hits, I'm getting a \"too many values to unpack\" error. \n\nEssentially it's such that:\n\nfor items in baseList:\n     for _,time1,_,_,_,time2 in items:\n            print(time1-time2)\n\nI was initially thinking it was trying to iterate over each character in each sub element but if I change the nested loop to\n\nfor moreitems in items:\n     print(moreitems)\n\nIt prints each sub element individually, so I'm not sure why it's telling me there are too many values to unpack?\n\nSorry for formatting had to post on mobile",

            "selftext": "I have a system on paper that allows biologists to design genetic regulatory networks using traditional programming syntax, but I don't know exactly how to make it a reality. Overall, the author would describe which transcription factors trigger which genes and the program, having an extensive library of known proteins and the DNA that codes for them, would output a string of nucleotides. I want to open a text editor, type something like:\n\n    if (protein_1_concentration > .2){\n         transcribe(protein_2);\n        }\n\nand the output would be something like:\n    \n     [ATATCGGG][ATS][TCGATGGCCGA][TAG]\n     [Protein 1 promotor sequence][Start codon][gene for protein 2][stop codon]\n\nWould I need to design a brand new language or could I simply make a library for python. Any suggestions from programmers and biologists alike would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!\n\n\n\n\n\nEDIT, Hopefully this is a more comprehensive design document:\n\nAn 'if' statement would trigger the creation of an 'operon'. An operon is a sequence of nucleotides consisting of a promoter, a start codon, all desired genes, and a stop codon in this form:\n\n    [PROMOTER][START][GENES][STOP]\n\nThe condition following the 'if' denotes the promoter sequence. for example, lets say the promoter sequence for TRANSCRIPTION_FACTOR_A is ATAGCGA. This:\n\n    if (transcription_factor_a){\n    ...\n    }\n\nwould be this:\n\n    [ATAGCGA][START][GENE][STOP]\n\nIn all organisms, the start codon is ATG. There are several stop codons, but we'll use TAG. Start and stop codons are required during translation (RNA -> protein) so the ribosome knows where the code for a single protein begins and ends.\n\nThe command within the curly parentheses denotes which genes will be transcribed. Let's imagine the gene for PROTEIN_A is TCGAAATGG. This:\n\n    if(transcription_factor_A){\n    transcribe(protein_A);\n    }\n\nwould be this:\n\n    [ATAGCGA][ATG][TCGAAATGG][TAG]\n    or \n    ATAGCGAATGTCGAAATGGTAG\n\nProtein_A could be a transcription factor itself, creating the potential for incredibly complex networks of gene regulation.\n\na single promoter could be responsible for translating multiple genes as long as there are start and stop codons surrounding each gene.\n\nThe transcribe function would have to include the names and nucleotide sequence of various proteins and transcription factors.\n    ",

            "selftext": "Hi guys,\n\nso i'm currently working on a script that should reset passwords on a list of hosts, connecting to the hosts works just and the password change works aswell. \n\nThe issue i run into exposes itself only when the \"new\" password doesn't meet the requirements of the system. So whenever that happens the system returns a message ala \"BAD password, retry:\" - for ever and ever, so the script is stuck in a loop. Since the Paramiko SSH Exec Method apparently only writes to either stderror or stdout *after* it has received any kind of exit code (which it doesn't in the above mentioned case, since the password application is still running) i can't use that to abort the script. \n\nTo circumvent this issue i've set a timeout of 5 seconds. Problem is: Paramiko apprently doesn't have any exceptions for this kind of event so i can't use an exception to tell the user what went wrong.\n\nDoes anybody have an idea how to solve this?\n\n\ntl;dr:\n\nScript connects to server\n\nTries to change password\n\nServer doesn't change password because it doesn't meet reuqirements but allows infinite retries.\n\nCommand was given a timeout\n\nParamiko apparently doesn't have an exception for the event of said timeout\n\nAre there any \"general exceptions\" i could fall back to?\n\n\nEdit: \n\nTo give you an overview of what happens:\n\nScript opens connection like this:\n\n    ssh.connect(ip, port=port_number, username=user, allow_agent=True)\n\n    password_change(old_password, new_password)\n\nThe password_change method looks like this:\n\n    stdin, stdout, stderr = ssh.exec_command(\"passwd\", timeout=5)\n    stdin.write(old_pw + \"\\n\" + new_pw + \"\\n\" + new_pw + \"\\n\")\n    stdin.flush()\n\nNow there a few more lines to it but they are not relevant to the issue. Ideally i'd put the above mentioned block in a try:\nand have an exception along the lines of \"paramiko.ssh_exception.Timeout\" - but Paramiko doesn't have that sort of exception according to their documentation.\n\n\nEdit2: \n\nFigured out a way without the exception in question. Apparently the passwd has a \"max try\" value after which it aborts. I was able to trigger that by sending another \\n with the stdin.write. This results in the passwd command being aborted if the password couldn't be set right away, thus allowing me to read and interprete stderr and stdout to allow the script to gracefully abort.",

But my code is Python so I thought I would start here.\n\nBACK ROUND: \nCurrently I am working on a new MacBook (quad core + good processor speed).  \n\nMy simulation is written to just run linearly / iteratively.  I originally planned to run 10k trials per data point (6.5M data points).  Unfortunately, a trial takes about a minute or two.  \n\nSo I am looking at like a 13 year runtime.\n\nQ1 - MULTITHREADING:\nI have never worked with this before.  But my intuition is that in order to take advantage of multiple processors I need to either:\n   -program multiple threads in my code\n   -or, create 4 separate modules where each one iterates \n   over a different 1/4 of the dataset (basically the same \n   thing?). \n\nIs this correct?\n\nQ2: DEFAULT SETTINGS AND CPU SLEEP:\nI think I could answer this with an experiment, and maybe it is more of a Mac question (thought I am curious in general...) If I run this thing and it is going to take days lets say, will the calculations continue if my computer goes to sleep?\n\nOr do I need to change some settings so it doesn't go to sleep?  Is it bad for the computer to be running like that for that long?\n\nI have an old Dell that is running Linux but I don't know the specs beyond the fact that they are much worse than this computer.\n\nAnyway, thanks for your help.",

I will give a little bit of Background information for what I am trying to do first.\n\nCurrently I am working on collecting data for Fantasy Sports. I have access to a paid site which I am trying to pull some specific stats off of. I have scraped plenty of other sites before but for some reason I can not get anything to pull up, and I believe it is because of ag-grid data which I have never seen before. Either way lets jump into my code. Please note I have hard coded wait times in here... This is just for diagnostic purposes and because I really dont care about the efficiency of this script as I just need to run it once.\n\nHTML:\nDidnt format correctly so here: https://pastebin.com/CsuZKfdM\n\nBasically the idea behind this is I want to pull all of the ag-cells for each ag-row. The next difficult thing with this website is different sections of stats are in different wrappers on the individual application... So this seems to be a nightmare already and like I said will probably need to go elsewhere for stats but anyway heres a snippet of my python.\n\n\toptions = webdriver.ChromeOptions()\n\toptions.add_argument('--ignore-certificate-errors')\n\n\tdriver = webdriver.Chrome(chrome_options=options)\n\tloginURL = \"http://www.fantasysiteiamusing.com/login\"\n\turl = \"http://www.fantasysiteiamusing.com/\"\n        \n\tdriver.get(loginURL)\n\thtml = driver.page_source\n\n\tusernameField = driver.find_element_by_xpath('/html/body/div[3]/form[1]/div[2]/div/input')\n\tpasswordField = driver.find_element_by_xpath('/html/body/div[3]/form[1]/div[3]/div/input')\n\tloginButton = driver.find_element_by_xpath('/html/body/div[3]/form[1]/div[4]/button')\n\n\tusernameField.send_keys(user)\n\tpasswordField.send_keys(pass)\n\n\tloginButton.click()\n\ttime.sleep(5)\n\tdriver.get(url)\n\ttime.sleep(5)\n\n\tsoup = BeautifulSoup(html, \"html5lib\")\n\n\ttable = soup.findAll(\"div\", class_=\"ag-row\")\n\tprint(table)\n\nSo obviously this isnt complete but I like to take it one step at a time as my programming skills are subpar. My main question here is why is my table variable not filling a list with every thing on the page that has a class name of ag-row? Thanks in advanced!\n",

            "selftext": "Hi! Being that this is my first post here, let me start off by thanking you for taking the time to read this. Anyways, on to my question.\n\nI have a script partly working on Linux; here's the [hastebin](https://hastebin.com/ovajicogoc.py).\nThe script can detect when the user presses most keys when they're pressed almost instantaneously. However, if the user presses the \"escape\" key, the script freezes.\n\nHere's why it does this.\nAssume the user presses the \"escape\" key. The character `\\x1b` is then passed to the shell, typically. With this in mind, now assume the user presses \"F3\", or really any of the other function keys, such as \"Insert\", etc. These keys pass multiple characters to the shell. I.e., the \"F1\" key looks like `\\x1bOP`.\n\nNow, we know what the keys look like when received, and we know what to return to the user when they're pressed. The problem at hand being, we can't discern whether or not the user has pressed the \"escape\" key, or any of the various function keys without first reading one more byte with\n\n`sys.stdin.read(1)`\n\nThe \"read(1)\" method is blocking, and will continue to block until it receives another byte. However, without being able to break from this block based on some condition, I can't think of a way to tell whether or not the \"escape\" key has been pressed, nor can I stop the \"escape\" key from freezing the whole script entirely.\n\nIf you have any ideas as to a method I could use to do this, please feel free to share. The ultimate goal is to avoid using `curses` or any of it's derivatives, and to do this in pure python. A hefty goal to say the least, but if you have an ideas or encouragement, please don't hesitate to share.\n\nThanks a ton!",

            "selftext": "Hey guys,\n\nthere's a couple of problems I don't quite know how to address in Python, and I'd be grateful for any tips/ideas.\n\nI want my program to manage \"blocks\" that correspond to text. An illustrative GUI is here: https://pasteboard.co/GM2vdlg.jpg. The code I was able to come up with is below.\n\nWhen a user presses the plus button, they can add blocks to the left column. These blocks correspond to text statements in the right column, and they can contain checkboxes/sliders/... to modify the text. (Like the \"negate\"-checkbox right now.)\n\nNow, I have the following problems:\n\n(1) I wasn't able to find the respective widgets in GTK+/Glade to model the left column and the blocks. (On the right there would be a text widget that I can eventually use to create an XML-based text document.)\n\n(2) How do I make it so that the user can add an arbitrary number of blocks? (In my code, they are instances, yet I don't know how to create and name instances at runtime. I think this might be \"reflection\" or \"factory methods\", but I don't quite get it.) Don't let the example confuse you here: There will be options to assign text to the blocks individually, and there will be more building blocks than \"statements\" and \"conclusions\".\n\n**Solved: x = []; x.append(myObject()). I didn't know that objects could be handled \"anonymously\" at runtime. Now I do.**\n\n(3) The blocks should be \"smart\", i. e. they should for instance recognise their neighbours. (Like in my example, the second statement recognises that there's a conclusion next to it and adds \", and thus\" to the text.) The blocks should basically \"manage themselves\" internally, so that whenever they are added or shifted around, they check a number of rules and modify the text accordingly.\n\nI am an intermediary python guy, and I know about classes and such, but I don't know what to make a class here, how to produce these blocks at runtime properly and how to bind the text in a modifiable way to the blocks.\n\nAgain, any suggestions and even just buzzwords (for further research/reading) is highly appreciated!\n\nP.S.: Thanks a lot to the kind people who answered my recent question, yet I guess it wasn't well formulated and thus a little misleading.\n\nMy code so far:\n\n    class Row():\n\n        row_positions = []\n\n        def addBlock(self, block):\n            self.row_positions.append(block)\n\n        def getPosition(self, block):\n            return self.row_positions.index(block)\n\n        def getRow(self):\n            return self.row_positions\n\n\n    class Block():\n\n        def __init__(self, color, row):\n            self.color = color\n            row.addBlock(self)\n\n\n    row1 = Row()\n\n    b1 =  Block(\"red\", row1)\n    b2 =  Block(\"green\", row1)\n\n    for n in row1.getRow():\n        print(n.color)",

I mean, I see how I can do that manually for a small number of input parameters. Like, I could have separate code for each fixed value of a (for example) with iterating for b and c, and run all codes at the same time. But I have 14 parameters and for each parameter I iterate over the list with 3-4 values.",

The idea is to have a generic class that can be plugged into any of your application that need to have real-time billing for certain duration. It doesn't assume anything about the application, as long as somehow you can call start() and stop() method of the same instance, it will work.\n\nI look forward to feedback on whether this is a viable approach, especially when you're looking at few hundred transactions at the same time.

See [this](http://stupidpythonideas.blogspot.ca/2015/12/pattern-matching-again.html) for example. \n\nI think this would be one of the most useful and worthwhile addition to the language, much more than a simple switch statement syntax.

            "selftext": "Hello folks!  I was wondering if anyone has any experience with thread pools and using Netmiko?  It seems for some reason once my code runs, if I choose anything about 1 thread, NetMiko seems to get confused...  I have a script that reads a file of lets say 100 IPs.  Telnets to them, checks the size of the logging buffer (cisco) and then sets it to what I want.  If I run one thread, the code will work flawless every time, except it takes awhile to run, hence me wanting to run thread pools.  The problem is when I look at my output, occasionally it will dump out saying its waiting for a particular hostname, but it was really logged in to a different device.  Occasionally it seems to just completely skip parts of the code calling netmiko to set the log buffer for instance.  For example, see a snippet below: \n\n    output1 = net_con.send_command('sh run | i logging')\n      if 'logging buffered 25000' in output1:\n       print(HOST + ' Logging pre-configured')\n       completed(HOST)\n      else:\n       print('#################### ' + HOST + ' did not have enlarged buffer enabled ####################')\n       print('Setting log buffer to 25k on ' + HOST)\n       set_logging = ['logging buffered 25000']#set log buff to 25k\n       output = net_con.send_config_set(set_logging)\n       print(output)#Print the set config\n       print('Log buffer set completed on ' + HOST)            \n\nWhat I'll occasionally see in my output: \n\nLogging in to 10.5.5.5\n#################### 10.5.5.5 did not have enlarged buffer enabled ####################\nSetting log buffer to 25k on 10.5.5.5\nLog buffer set completed on 10.5.5.5\n\nWhat seems to happen is it completed skips over printing any output, not even displaying any errors.  Others times the code will dump with various errors.  Other times Ill see the hostname# then it goes right to conf t, end, never actually sending the config commands.  I guess long story short - has anyone had success getting netmiko threaded?  Thanks in advance!",

About 1-2 years ago I started messing around with Python and I'd say now that I'm pretty well versed in it. I understand classes/functions/decorators/numpy/matplotlib/etc etc. I can figure out how to write a Python script for many different situations if I have enough time.\n\nNow I have a job interview at a large company, in fact maybe the best company I could probably work at. The position is for a hardware test engineer (for what sounds like possibly bluetooth speakers) who is very good with Python. \n\nDoes anyone know a good site to prepare for Python interviews? Or what modules I should learn for Python as an electrical engineer? Are there any electrical engineers who use Python for hardware testing here? What should I look into to be prepared?\n\nRight now I write test modules for hard drives with Python, but they are for a very specific piece of testing equipment that basically does all the nitty gritty for me. \n\nThanks.\n",

Real as in I'm trying to combine a lot of different aspects I've learned to build something semi-useful as well as reinforce my learning.\n\nLong story short it's an app that uses Kivy and Mapview to load up a map with a bunch of location specific markers and then adds interaction onto that. Thus far in building the rest of the app is going well but I'm just giving it random locations (longitude, latitude values) to test. Ultimately I'd like to pull these locationa from a database so multiple users on multiple phones could all see the same markers and the database can be updated with new entries.\n\nI've messed around with databases briefly on PythonAnywhere but I'm looking for suggestions regarding my best options. I'm assuming I need 1) a database and 2) some hosting. (A NoSQL db seems like an option considering my use). Small and lightweight is ideal. I like the idea and document format of TinyDB but from what I can tell there is no way have this be my universal db because it is unique/locked in to each individual app.\n\nOpen to all suggestions, thanks!",

I am really happy with what I have been doing, but there is a downside to my situation, the same downside, not learning as much as I think I could, for two different reasons:\n\n- I work for/with a really small startup, so the code base doesn't have the quality I would expect from bigger fish. Same with development methologies and work cycle, but these aspects are not the point of this post.\n\n- As a solo contractor, I am not learning from anybody else different than myself. I feel like working in a team (which has its own many different evils) would mean I'd pick up skills and learn from more experienced colleagues.\n\nOften I stumble upon problems I find really hard to solve. I rack my brain for hours but won't find a solution. Meanwhile, I can see other people online, like in videos or articles, who solve hard problems in a snap, with really creative solutions. I feel like I would never be able to come up with that stuff like they do. Sometimes I am not even able to understand what they're doing myself!\n\nFinally my point: as a solo freelancer, who have nobody to learn from, how can I improve my problem-solving skills? How can I train my brain to be able to face harder problems successfully?\n\nShould I start a project on my own? Maybe start taking online challenges regularly, like project Euler? Or some other similar sites? What do you recommend?\n\nThank you in advance.",

            "selftext": "Hey, guys.\n\nJust a couple words about myself: Python script-kiddie who only have being used it on occasion as a tool to quickly assemble some messy function-based code to solve some task at hand. Never played with OOP (though I have some basic OOP understanding from my times of C which are long gone).\n\nI'm considering undertaking a really ambitious project. The main part of its concept will be \"open-sourceness\" and easy extensibility, sort of \"hot-plug\" kind. As project will be complex and huge, I'll have to employ OOP to make it readable/manageable, thus easy for anybody to jump in and extend it on demand. As I mentioned, it will be a web app, and I'm planning to use Django as a framework.\n\nBut I'm a bit uncertain what will be the best, the only effective way to approach it. Here is my [possibly wrong] understanding of the situation. Let's suppose I have my basic, core functionality implemented. It's a bunch of classes, they are instantiated into objects, some functions of those objects are called, objects are being passed into other functions - things are humming and sun shines above :)\n\nNow, I need to implement sort of addon, or plugin, or whatever, which can be easily attached to existing code, **preferably without changing anything at all in it, except for adding some includes** - and will basically change how certain functions work and objects behave. Still doesn't seem like a too complex task, right? I know that functions can be re-loaded etc.\n\nBut let's move one step further. Now I need the whole thing to be extensible with a bunch of such \"addons\" (written by different people) and applied to it **simultaneously**. And they must not conflict with each other. Thus, if some function does thing A, and one guy's addon reloads it so it now makes B, third guy may just want it to keep doing B, but also do C **after** B is done, and fourth guy may need to add functionality that sometimes use changes added by previous guys, and sometimes doesn't and uses a core, basic functionality instead - depending on some conditions... And here I'm totally lost.\n\nI hope it doesn't look like total gibberish. In other words, what will be the easiest way to make my basic code completely extensible (meaning any, or most part of its functionality must be) with some plugins/addons written by different people? Is it possible at all? Are there some models and best practice designs for such kind of apps?\n\n**Edit:**\nJust want to clarify: by \"addon/plugin\" I don't mean something complex, like dll or standalone code. It can be just a Python file, or few of them, overriding/extending some functions/classes, possibly adding new ones; which need to be added to the main code with \"inlcude\". The main point here is that the process of addition **must** be very quick, easy, straightforward. No change to base code should be needed at all. This design also **must** be able to handle totally new functionality added to the base code through such addons correctly. So it's not only about reloading some existing functions.\n",

I want to give users limited access to the files to edit them but I don't want to give them too much because they could wreck serious havoc if they did. So I not only want to limit who can access the files but also limit the amount of changes they're allowed to do.\n\nMy idea was this: In the (directory/directories) above those config files, set the read/write/execute permissions to only a special group, called \"foo\" and do not give any user the \"foo\" group. That way, no one can open the raw file and make edits to it, directly. But if they use my tool, I can authenticate them using X (not sure what X will be yet. Probably a SQL table of whitelisted users - or something) and also limit what they can change in the file. If the user has the proper permissions, I'd kick off some kind of service (in Python) which has access to the \"foo\" group and then the changes will be made to the file.\n\nPlease correct me if this is totally the wrong way to do things \n - I know next to nothing about network security - but I am pretty familiar with Python. Any links/topics/keywords that could help me search for what I'm trying to accomplish would be really appreciated.

What this means is that a regular ssh connection looks like this:\n\n(assume I'm logged into a network device or whatever)\n\n    ciscoasa# configure terminal\n    ciscoasa(config)#\n\nIn my shell, because I use raw_input it looks like this:\n\n    ciscoasa#\n    configure terminal\n    ciscoasa(config)#\n    (cursor waits here because of a loop which I've said to wait for the raw_input of the next command)\n\nWhat's happening is that the result of the last command executed leaves the cursor at the end of ciscoasa#.  But when I now use raw_input to capture the next command, it starts a new line where I then enter \"configure terminal\".  I don't want that.  So I need some way of making the cursor not start a new line in raw_input (which I've heard isn't possible), or some alternative way to keep the position of the cursor at the end of the last output, i.e. after the # sign, to enter a new command.

About 10ms in 1million iterations. \n\nAnyway, I wasn't really trying to convince anyone that my way was any better (infact, I'd have just done init in constructor as self.bar was given then) \n\nIt just led me to think how people usually are doing these sort of conditional initializations and what would be the proper pythonic way ?

Alas the libraries are either not platform-independent (uses external C library) or are GPL licensed (IPTCInfo is said to be GPL licensed).\n\nMy project is free (as in no cost) and FOSS (in fact MIT) but not GPL, and I don't want to add such restriction as a viral license. Are there any other library that allows to write metadata in jpg and also png (and if possible more formats)?\n\nAlso, I find it very strange that the source code of IPTCInfo (https://bitbucket.org/gthomas/iptcinfo/raw/0dc2b4e3de4ec3708002fcd1b23b9aed5df3b237/iptcinfo.py) says it's :\n\n> This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n\n> it under the same terms as Python itself.\n\nBut the project page says it's GPL (2 or 3? not specified).\n\nThen what is it?

To me it feels easier to think about my dataframes without any Index, but then I use reset_index etc. quite often, because pandas kind of forces an Index in many operations.\nFurthermore, having one column as an Index means using different methods and way of thinking to manipulate the dataframe, which feels inconsistent and error-prone.\n\nFor those who are using the Index, do you see it as a great advantage? I can imagine some operations will be a bit faster, but what about if that is not a concern?\n\nThanks!",

However, the problem with this is that this doesn't actually result in any compression as I am just representing Huffman codes as strings of 8 bit characters and not as the n-bit values they represent eg '010' is 8*3 bits in size instead of 3 bits (010) in size I would like. \n\nMy question is, is there a way to manipulate integers in python so I am working with just raw 1s and 0s instead of having to manipulate values as integers are represented this way in python? Or as python has arbitrary integer length, is this automatically done? Or does python just not allow this level of bit manipulation?\n\nAny help is appreciated",

For example, let's say I type\n    variable='hello'\n\nPycharm only applies the formatting after pressing Ctrl + Alt + L. Is there a way to do it live/real-time as I'm coding?\n\nSo basically as I type and am super lazy and not entering spaces, it will convert this:\n\n    variable='hello'\n\ninto this:\n\n    variable = 'hello'\n\nkind of like autocorrect feature when you type a text message on your phone?\n\n2) pycharm has this handy feature where if I type\n\n    print('\n\nit automatically completes it with ')\n\nbut after i fill out the middle part, is there a way i can press Enter or some other fast key and jump out of the first wrapper? So for example, the cursor would move in between the closing apostrophe and the closing parenthesis so it looks like this '|)\n\nThe only shortcut I've been able to find is End, but that brings you completely out.",

Sometimes there's handwriting in there between printed text that screws up the character recognition in Adobe acrobat pro. Adobe seems to have trouble even deciphering the printed ink text that is perfect. \n\nThe problem gets worse, the tickets aren't printed in an excel friendly format really. The are all the same format though and they are batch scanned in so theres probably 40-50 at least in each batch (pdf).\n\nI need all this data in excel so I can check it for errors and discrepancies.  I don't know the best way to do this (they were entering by hand before). Do I need a vba macro in excel or JavaScript in adobe? I think the best thing to do is to try to get the extract data I need from the specific areas of each type data only instead of using OCR on the whole ticket. \n\nI also exported the whole tickets to Word and the OCR seemed to work better for that transfer for some reason. I thought it might be easier to transfer the data from word to excel instead of acrobat to excel.\n\nIf there are any other subs to post this to that might be helpful, I'd like to know. If I don't figure a way to do this soon I'll have type each ticket into excel by hand. Ill die from inefficiency.\n\nI'm not an experienced programmer so something very complecated will not be easy for me.

([See screenshot of my overlay with chroma key de-activated for an idea of what i'm doing.](https://i.imgur.com/Imr8jf4.jpg)) \n\nHere is my code so far and I appreciate any input: https://pastebin.com/mkUAg7B0\n\nI successfully have it drawing blue squares around the letters after messing with the code...here is a screenshot of it running: https://i.imgur.com/JwKZlhw.png - when you press any of those keys it will highlight it with a blue square, which is the desired outcome, returning to green when it is no longer pressed.\n\nThe problem I run into is when I press too many of the keys, too fast. It seems it will not register the UpKey sometimes and as a result it will continue to show that the key is pressed down, which I want to fix. Can someone point me in the right direction? Thank you and sorry if the question is stupid.\n\n**UPDATE** : I'll leave this here in case anyone else runs into this but it turns out it was a case-sensitive issue where I was only looking for lowercase w,a,s,d and when I would hit the shift button, which is the hand-brake in the game, then releasing w,a,s or d would generate an UpKey event for the capital letter, leaving the lowercase off in limbo until another DownKey event. I wrote in the uppercase scenarios too and now it works like a dream.\n\nThanks for putting up with me!",

            "selftext": "## Objective\n\nDuring my research, I get several data like this:\n\n| Sampling | Probability | Error       | \n|---------:|------------:|------------:| \n| Leverage | 0.1         | 9.21E-05    | \n| Leverage | 0.1         | 9.57E-05    | \n| Uniform  | 0.1         | 1.27E-04    | \n| Uniform  | 0.1         | 1.20E-04    | \n| Uniform  | 0.1         | 1.22E-04    | \n| Leverage | 0.2         | 1.61E-05    | \n| Leverage | 0.2         | 1.71E-05    | \n| Leverage | 0.2         | 1.50E-05    | \n| Leverage | 0.2         | 1.60E-05    | \n| Uniform  | 0.2         | 3.20E-05    | \n| Uniform  | 0.2         | 3.10E-05    | \n\nAnd of course I want to plot them in an appropriate form, with python. The resulting plot should be something like this:\n\n1. The x axis is probability, and y axis is error (preferably in log scale).\n2. The data with label \"Uniform\" and \"Leverage\" should be plotted separately, and colored differently.\n3. Instead of showing all the data points, their mean with confidence interval should be plotted.\n4. Since probabilities are numbers, the interval between points in x axis should reflect it.\n5. There should be two lines (for the \"Sampling\" categories), connecting means of each clusters.\n\nI believe that people will come across this kind of chart quite frequently. However, plotting it with python libraries was painful for me (unless I'm missing something). Of course, preprocessing the data would have made it significantly easier, but I didn't want to do that, in a vague belief that it would be easy to plot this with powerful python libraries.\n\n## Attempts\n\n### Matplotlib (+ Seaborn, Pandas, Bokeh)\n\nI knew that it wouldn't be simple to do this thing with MPL, which would presumably involve a number of numpy operations, so I decided to use seaborn and pandas together. But it (surprisingly) turns out that they are not very helpful for this task. After a few attempts involving some groupby and aggregation operations, I was successful to plot mean values of each (sampling, probability) cluster and connect them with lines, but when it comes to plotting error bars, I didn't feel like going on with these libraries. Of course I know that this is certainly possible, but I didn't want to mess with a series of operations further.\n\n### Altair\n\nI'm a fan of altair and also knew that it was premature, so I didn't expect too much. I felt quite satisfactory until the point when my code was like:\n\n> import pandas as pd  \n> from altair import *  \n>   \n> err_data = pd.read_csv(\"../err.csv\")  \n> df = expr.DataFrame(err_data)  \n>   \n> Chart(df).mark_circle().encode(  \n> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    x = X(\"Probability:Q\",  \n> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;          axis = Axis(format = 'f')),  \n> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    y = Y(\"mean(Error)\",  \n> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;          axis = Axis(format = 'e'),  \n> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;         scale = Scale(type = \"log\")),  \n> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    color = \"Sampling:N\"  \n> )  \n\nThe result for this simple code was like [this](https://imgur.com/xgMNt3I). So far, so good. However, drawing error bars was something entirely different. [One of the examples](https://altair-viz.github.io/gallery/errorbar_aggregate.html) they provided had error bars in it, but it was not something I expected. In this example, the error bars are drawn by plotting ticks and rules one by one, and the code reuse was horrible. This is certainly not elegant. I could give it a try if something like y = Y(\"mean(Error) + stdev(Error)\") were to be possible, but it was not the case, so the data preprocess procedure seemed inevitable. The situation would be better when Altair 2.0 comes out, which is based on vega-lite 2.0, then I can plot the ticks with y = Y(\"ei0(Error)\") and y = Y(\"ei1(Error)\"), but the code reuse is still something I would like to avoid.\n\n### Plotnine\n\nI knew that ggplot2 of R is a powerful, elegant, and easy-to-use tool, but somehow I still remain ignorant to R to this date. Long ago I tried ggpy (former ggplot), a python implementation of ggplot2, but it lacked several functionalities and somehow didn't work as I expected.\n\nFortunately, another implementation called plotnine exists, which claims to be more consistent to ggplot2 than ggpy is. So I gave it a try, and finally I could get decent results with only a few lines of code:\n\n> import pandas as pd  \n> from plotnine import *  \n>   \n> data = pd.read_csv(\"../err.csv\")  \n> (ggplot(data)  \n> + aes(x = \"Probability\", y = \"Error\", color = \"Sampling\", fill = \"Sampling\")  \n> + stat_summary(fun_data = \"mean_cl_normal\", geom = \"linerange\", size = 1)  \n> + stat_summary(fun_data = \"mean_cl_normal\", geom = \"line\", size = 0.2)  \n> + scale_y_continuous(trans = \"log10\")  \n> )  \n\n[The resulting plot](https://imgur.com/TaSiDpx) was finally something I expected.",

This script would be used to increase chances of buying limited sneakers during online draws. Once shoes appear in the draw, you have an hour to register for them. Each person can register for those shoes once with his account. It is possible to create multiple accounts and then register for this draw with them, however it is very easy to get banned when using one proxy doing so. Let's say I set up 100 accounts, each account linked to 1 proxy. It will prevent me from getting banned, but I won't be able to enter the draw with each account separately because I only have an hour to do so. \nMy question is, would be possible to somehow link all those accounts (under different proxies) with eachother and manually guide them all at once through required steps to enter the draw, so it would look like I registered to the draw with one account manually, but in reality all the accounts would follow the same exact steps ( except logging in with different credentials )? \n\nI hope I made some sense, I am total noob at those things. If someone thinks it can be made, let me know, I am willing to pay.",

I started off trying to use regex which seems to be the first choice of most but I couldn't seem to get anything to work. Plus, I'll be pulling in a number of other, javascript tables from this site which are all different and so rather than create regex's for each I wanted to try to just have a universal parsing method. \n\nI'm still fairly new to python/programming and completely new to anything involving javascript so there's likely to be more efficient, more pythonic ways to go about all this but since I found a surprisingly sparse amount of straight-forward, up to date info on doing this and poor documentation/examples on how to use execjs, I figured I'd share the basic process I found to work.

            "selftext": "Hi everyone,  \nI'm working on a Debian server (version 8) that captures some h.264 streams from security cameras with ffmpeg, and stores them in chunks of 1 minute long mp4 videos.  \nMy task is the following: Check if the cameras have been covered (have gone dark), or some light have been pointed directly into the camera so it's saturated (completely white).\n\nThe \"dark check\" has to keep into account that on the stream there are some white timestamps, a logo and some noise, so it's never completely dark, even if you paint over the camera lens with a spry can.\n\nI was thinking about this solution:\n\n1) For every minute long video, extract the middle frame with ffmpeg into a jpg file  \n2) I analyze the jpg file with python to extract the average  brightness.  \n3) If the brightness is close to \"0\" (8 bit black) or \"255\" (8 bit white) it will trigger a warning\n\nThe server has about 40 cameras recording 24/7 and of course the computational load of the \"dark\" and \"white\" check must be as low as possible.\n\nDo you think my approach is reasonable? Could I do this with other tools? \n\nI was thinking about OpenCV to extract the frame instead of ffmpeg to keep everything in RAM but I don't really know the library.\n\nThanks in advance.",

For example, here's a snippet for how long a VM took to spawn, with timestamp:\n\n    cat <otherlogfile where we redirect stdout from logster>:\n    1503603001 spawn.num_count 1\n    1503603001 spawn.mean 14.36\n    1503603001 spawn.median 14.36\n    1503603001 spawn.90th_percentile 14.36\n    1503603001 spawn.95th_percentile 14.36\n    1503603602 spawn.num_count 6\n    1503603602 spawn.mean 24.78\n    1503603602 spawn.median 20.035\n    1503603602 spawn.90th_percentile 37.025\n    1503603602 spawn.95th_percentile 42.5975\n\n\n\nBut that's not very useful. SO I was thinking of using Graphite to store and visualize the metrics: https://graphiteapp.org/\n\nI was first thinking of using logster's Graphite plugin to just send that data over directly to Graphite.\n\nBut thn I've been hearing a lot about things like Prometheus, statsd, etc... in the enterprise world. Is my approach the best way? Or are there better tools to achieve what I'm doing. Apparently statsd was ALSO developed by the folks at etsy, and i've been hearing more about it, and this also can send data to a Graphite backend. Then I've been hearing a lot about Prometheus (https://prometheus.io/) which is another time series database that also does alerting - not sure if alerting and monitoring can be done by Graphite too - but this might be useful in addition to visualization\n",

The first semester is supposed to be just pseudocode, but I got lucky and had the one professor that actually teaches python instead of just pseudocode. \n\nAfter I took the first class, I got really into python, and spent my summer going really deep into python, and learned a lot. Now this semester, which begins as the first official programming class with a little C++, is complete review to me, and incredibly boring.\n\nI spoke with my teacher, and she offered the option for me to choose some large scale project in any language of my choosing (Python!) that I could spend the whole semester working on instead of participating in class.\n\nThis idea sounded awesome to me, so I wanted to hear suggestions from this community on to project ideas...I'm a math major currently in Calculus II, so anything math related would be pretty cool. Neural Nets are always fun too, but I'm not sure where I would go to learn enough about NNs to be able to risk my grade on creating one.\n\nAnyways, what do you all think?\n\nOne idea I had was to create a wolfram-alpha style mathematical computation program, where the user could input math equations and/or questions and receive an answer.\n\nThanks!",

            "selftext": "tl;dr: Questions at the bottom.\n\nUsing units while working on something in the real world is really useful, but it can sometimes get in the way. For example, if you want to simulate something, you'd probably want to use numpy arrays.\n\nHere's how you would implement a na\u00efve Euler's method:\n\n    def next_step(state):\n         v1, v2, v3 = state\n         return np.array([\n              v1_updater(v1),\n              v2_updater(v2),\n              v3_updater(v3),\n        ])\n\n    state_vector = np.array([v1, v2, v3])\n    results = state_vector\n    while condition:\n        state_vector += dt * next_step(state_vector)\n        result = np.vstack((result, state_vector))\n\n-----------\n\nOn the other hand, when you want to use units, you have some drawbacks.\n\n# Pint\n\n    import pint\n    u = pint.UnitRegistry()\n\nWith Pint, for instance, you need to set the dtype explicitly (e.g., `state_vector = np.array([v1, v2, v3], dtype=object)`), and it doesn't seem to allow you to foil a unit. For example, if you try this:\n\n    state_vector + dt * next_step(state_vector)\n\nYou get a dimensionality error because the state vector is heterogenous (overall unitless), while `dt * next_step(state_vector)` is in seconds. If, say, `v1` is in metres, `next_step(state_vector)[0]` would be in metres per second, and should give metres too when multiplied by `dt`. Instead, you'll have to change `next_step` to incorporate the `dt` on every single line:\n\n    def next_step(state, dt):\n         v1, v2, v3 = state\n         return np.array([\n              dt * v1_updater(v1),\n              dt * v2_updater(v2),\n              dt * v3_updater(v3),\n        ], dtype=object)\n\nThen, when you update, it would be:\n\n    state_vector += next_step(state_vector, dt)\n    \nThis is a lot of repetition, and it kind of negates us using numpy in the first place.\n\nAlso, when graphing, you'd need to homogenize the results:\n\n    def homogenize_array_with_units(array):\n        return [i.m for i in array] * array[0].units\n\n    v1, v2, v3 = [homogenize_array_with_units(variable) for variable in result.T]\n\n-----------------\n\n# Sympy\n\n     import sympy.physics.units as u\n\nSympy has the physics.units module, which we can try to use. It's type is a multiplication, so `0 * u.m` ends up as 0 instead of as a quantity.\n\nWith Sympy, we can keep everything the same as above, except for plotting. Matplotlib can't plot it though, and you need to divide everything by the units, except you need to do it manually because you don't have a units method. You can do that with:\n\n    np.product(variable.args[1:])\n\nSo you can get the numbers like this:\n\n    def numerical(array):\n        return array / np.product(array[1].args[1:])  # array[1] can't contain 0 because sympy\n\n-------------------------------\n\nSo, which one do you use? What do you recommend? Is there a better way of having heterogenous arrays or multiplying through if using Pint?",

Let's say in the right side of the window ther is a frame with the 3 polys and on the left side of the window ther is a frame with the name of the polygons( poly1, poly2, poly3). When an user selects on the left side a polygon the drawing corresponding to it is highlighted on the right side. \n\nMy question is: What libraries I need to use to accomplish this? For the interface i can use Tkinter, for the coords- ezdxf. But, for the drawing plot what shoul I use? I am looking into matplotlib but it does not seem right.",

I have a boilerplate of code, but obviously I'm going to end up with 50 repositories, one for each state. The idea is that once the project is finished we will run all the states together and produce some interesting final results. We store our projects privately on bitbucket. \n\nI sometimes make adjustments to the boilerplate, and I would love if I could get that to reflect in each state's repository. I'm worried I'll have to go through each state individually and tell it to sync, and even if I resolve to deal with that, I'm worried it will involve resolving a shitload of merge conflicts for each state.\n\nIs there a good way to go about this?

For example,\nrhombus('x', 8, 4)\nprints\n   xxxxxxxx\n  xxxxxxxx\n xxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxx\n\nI'm new to python and seem to be having trouble figuring out what type of statements I should be using. The only code I could come up with would make a rectangle, for example:\n\n\ndef rectangle(char, w, h):\n  for i in range(h):\n    print char*w\n\nI'm not really sure what I should do to add a space for each line.

But the core functions work well.\n\nThis project works on Python 3.3 or above.\n\nFeatures:\n\n* Easy to install and deploy.\n* Write and publish with Markdown.\n* Manage articles in one directory.\n* No database and admin panel, everything is file.\n* Compatible with Windows, macOS, Linux and even WSL or Android.\n* Everything is configurable.\n* Customize your blog with plugins and themes.\n* Deploy on Apache, Nginx, standalone WSGI containers or just built-in server.\n\nAnd some further info:\n\n* \"No database\" also means there is no one index file (e.g. index.json or post_list.json), neither yaml meta info in the markdown files. \n* For details of how this works you can visit the following demo(this is my blog, but I have no posts now, so i let it be a demo).\n* There is no parsed html cache on disk, I just store them in variables.\n* There is no \"creation time\" in ext4 and some fs, so I can only sort posts by modification time. :(\n* I didn't use blueprints and some modules or plugins of flask, cause i wanna do some things in my own way.\n\nLinks:\n\n* Github(How to install): https://github.com/deluxghost/DelogX\n* Demo(How to use): https://deluxghost.me/\n* PyPI(Nevermind): https://pypi.python.org/pypi/DelogX\n\nDon't forget i haven't finished any documentation.\n\nEDIT: \n\nWhy not static generators?  What's the diffrence?\n\nI didn't choose a static generator like pelican because i don't like the build process(even i can use CI to automatic this), i just want to throw some files in to the folder then they work.\n\nDelogX has many diffrence, it doesn't have database, index file, yaml meta header, built html file, and you don't need to type time in your file names.\n\nEvery markdown file is valid, i don't need to rename it to yyyy-mm-dd-title.md, don't need to write \"title: blabla\" in file, and don't need to edit a file tell the program \"i just added a new post\".\n\nI never make DelogX a static project, you can see DelogX doesn't support gh-pages, it is designed for self-hosting.\n\nBTW, python 3 is almost the easiest to install environment on Linux.",

            "selftext": "Hello all!\n\nToo avoid annoying anyone, questions first, explanations after the questions if you are curious why I ask\n\nPS. I did read facts and discussions but worried about up-to-dateness \n\n1. Best resources to learn python? I've been using YouTube a lot (the new boston)\n2. Why python over node (I'm a web developer) \n3. Do I need a degree? \n4. What does it take to be a python 'god' \n5. Need fun projects to learn my way around\n6. What is pythons future \n\n\nOkay, so now that is out of the way, this is the part you can skip if you don't want any kind of background. \n\nI have been a web developer for around 5 years, in a stagnating position that has somewhat killed my passion for the field, but not all the way. I've been doing basic node, php, c#, and being a front end developer for this time period. I decided to teach myself a new language, and basically did a base amount of research and I fell in love with python as it reminded me of PUG (a node templating engine) and the more I worked with it the more I loved it! \n\nNow that I am halfway through a basic tutorial of python, I'm starting to worry about where I can move on from here. Now onto the questions. \n\nFor question 3 I specifically ask because I really don't want to go back to school, as I have a 2 year degree (ie: a joke degree) and became successful with it I'm a firm believer in working your ass off can make you achieve anything. I don't really believe school is right for me.\n\nFor question 4 - there are references made in TV shows and such that focus heavily on code (with research) that sometimes just boggles my mind and I feel completely lost. I went to a tech college and they basically taught us the bare minimum to get a entry level job - which I approve of because it fosters the environment that those who try succeed, but I really don't know where to move onto after I master oop.\n\nQuestion 6 - I've done my research on it, but so many sources say so many different things and I'm not sure what is reliable and what's not. Even if the language is projected to die I'd still learn it for fun, but I rather know what a possible future looks like for me.\n\n\n\nThank you everyone who decides to help me! :) ",

Is there any high level dendrogram plotting, tree cutting for clustering, and tree traversal modules?  I've been developing my own but I really just can't imagine that I'm not reinventing the wheel.  For my object, I have a distance matrix, use scipy for linkage calculation, scipy for clustering, and then matplotlib for plotting along with plotting the clusters.  high level plotting with the dendrogram is a nightmare and it works for my datasets but my code is a lot of patchwork.  My question: Is there any module in Python that has the ability to take a distance matrix, compute the linkage matrix, compute the clusters, then plot everything together while being able to access the clusters?  Am I reinventing the wheel? This seems like a basic library that should be in the PyData stack . ",

I've been dabbling with Ruby for a month (my last language was Basic on a C=64 30 years ago). \n\nLately, when I'm in the classroom, I really can't get around how anachronistic our profession is.  Technology will (and should) absolutely eat our lunch.\n\nRight now schools are in bed with Google.  We buy the Chromebooks.  We've got everyone on Google Docs.  We've stopped buying MS Office licenses.  We've shut off over half our local servers (urban district: 70 buildings, 20k students).\n\nSo my thinking (as a neophyte) is go the Python route.  I'm not interested in start-ups (Ruby's strength?).  It's likely leading Tech Ed companies are going to use Python because Google does.  I might never be a full stack developer, but with a M.Ed and a strong understanding of tech and a working understanding of Python I feel like I would be marketable.\n\nI should also add that, since I need to learn computational thinking and the basics of CS, I'd like to avoid JavaScript for this first go-around.  If that's unrealistic, please advise but I've heard the syntax and logic alone tends to bury newbies (and my brain isn't exactly suited to math, computation, logic to begin with).\n\nI concede that I have no idea what I don't know.

            "selftext": "Hey Guys, recently applied to a job and then send me an interivew questions that I had 24 hours to solve. The questions was:\n\nProblem statement -\n\nWrite a class called Autocomplete. This class must have a constructor that receives a list called word_list that contains all the known words in lowercase. The class must have a find function that receives a string called pattern and returns a list with all the possible words that start with the given pattern. If no word is found, then return null.\n\nImportant: Design Constraints: \nword_list can be extremely long, design accordingly.\nThe find function must not loop through the whole list to find the matching words.\nYou cannot use any third party library.\nSolutions are expected to be in Python\n\nCases\n1. ) \nOne character\nword_list = ['aardvark', 'altimeter', 'apotactic', 'bagonet', 'boatlip', 'carburant', 'chyliferous', 'consonance', 'cyclospondylic', 'dictyostele', 'echelon', 'estadal', 'flaunty', 'gesneriaceous', \n'hygienic', 'infracentral', 'jipijapa', 'lipoceratous', 'melanthaceae']\n\npattern = 'a'\n\nexpected output: ['aardvark', 'altimeter', 'apotactic']\n\n2. ) \n\u2018ani\u2019 characters\n\nword_list = ['angiohydrotomy', 'angiospermal', 'anglist', 'angularization', 'anhungry', 'animalcule', 'anisaldehyde', 'anisometric', 'ankylenteron', 'annette']\n\npattern = 'ani'\n\nexpected output: ['animalcule', 'anisaldehyde', 'anisometric']\n\n3. ) \n\u2018venture\u2019 characters\n\nword_list = word_list = ['bagonet', 'consonance', 'estadal', 'hygienic', 'melanthaceae', 'overwander', 'prototypographer', 'siphonocladales', 'transferography', 'venturesomeness']\n\npattern = 'venture'\n\nexpected output: ['venturesomeness']\n\n4. ) \n\u2018foobar\u2019 characters\n\nword_list = ['anisaldehyde', 'anisometric', 'ankylenteron']\n\npattern = 'foobar'\n\nexpected output: None\n\n\nMy solution was: \n\n#Solution 2 - using lambda filter\n\n\n    class WordComplete2:\n        def __init__(self, pattern, wordList):\n             self.pattern = pattern\n             self.wordlist = wordList\n   \n       def displayCount(self):\n             b = list(filter(lambda x: x.startswith(self.pattern), self.wordlist))\n             print(b) if b else print('None')\n\n    emp1 = WordComplete2(pattern,word_list)\n\n    import time\n    start_time = time.time() \n    emp1.displayCount()\n    elapsed_time = time.time() - start_time\n    print('Time:',elapsed_time)\n\n\n\n\n# Solution 3 - using list comp - this does use a loop, but I think its still pretty efficient/clean/pythonic\n\n    class WordComplete3:\n        def __init__(self, pattern, wordList):\n            self.pattern = pattern\n            self.wordlist = wordList\n   \n       def displayCount(self):\n            b = list([n for n in self.wordlist if n.startswith(self.pattern)])\n            print(b) if b else print('None')\n    \n    \n\n    emp1 = WordComplete3(pattern,word_list)\n\n    import time\n    start_time = time.time()\n    emp1.displayCount()\n    elapsed_time = time.time() - start_time\n    print('Time:', elapsed_time)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Solution 4 - Using map first then filter with a conditional\n\n    class WordComplete4:\n        def __init__(self, pattern, wordList):\n             self.pattern = pattern\n             self.wordlist = wordList\n   \n        def displayCount(self):\n                b =  list(filter(lambda x:x != None, map(lambda x:x if x.startswith(self.pattern) else None, self.wordlist)))\n                print(b) if b else print('None')\n    emp1 = WordComplete4(pattern,word_list)\n    import time\n    start_time = time.time()\n    emp1.displayCount()\n    elapsed_time = time.time() - start_time\n    print('Time:',elapsed_time)\n\n\n\nI didnt move forward after this step, and I was wondering if somebody would be wiling to tell me how I could have improved/changed what I was doing. I considered using the pool for parallel processing but that was the only other thing I thought of.\n\n\nThanks in advance!",

But I remain completely confused about how to implement what I am trying to do.  \n\nHere's an overview, perhaps I am fundamentally misunderstanding how hashing can be used:\n\nSay I have a large text, such as the full text of Alice in Wonderland.  Someone inputs text - perhaps an enquiry, or a message, that will be used for internal notifications - but when they do, I want to scan the Alice in Wonderland text to see if anything they've typed in happens to occur in the AiW text, and if so, return the sentence in the AiW text that matches.  And this has to happen, of course, fast, in real-time.\n\nAm I correct that this would be most rapidly accomplished by my making what seems to be called a \"hash table\" of the AiW text, that I could then compare to real-time hashed input text?\n\nWould that hash table hold true across time/boots such that I could create a persistent hash table for each text I have stored?\n\nAm I barking up the wrong tree?  \n\nI think I've confused myself in reading over my head on this issue...  need some pointers for implementation.  I'm thinking this would be faster than using regexp... but I may be utterly wrong.\n\n",

I don't want to run \"conda install awscli\" in fear that it will not install properly (and that I won't be able to fix it).  I've read that it sometimes will not install properly: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37282994/how-to-install-awscli-on-a-anaconda-python-distribution\n\nAlso, i tried to do the pip install awscli but that didnt work from inside conda either.  I'm probably doing this wrong, so I apologize in advance if I'm just not understanding. \n\nCan anyone confirm with me the proper way to install it? (Or if awscli is supported with Anaconda)\n\nI'm running: Anaconda3,  Python 3.6.2 |Anaconda custom (64-bit)|\n\nEDIT: a word\n",

            "selftext": "Hi Everyone,\n\nSo I've been learning Python with [Automate the Boring Stuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) and have completed till chapter 8. I have gone off-track a bit and did some stuff of my own such as this [simple database based login module](https://github.com/tiazahmd/Simple-Login-Module). At this point, I would like to dive deeper into OOP (I have little to no knowledge at all) and some other complex Python stuff. I have also been tinkering with JavaScript and JQuery. As I'm moving forward, I'm not sure what I would want to be as a programmer - for example, I like front-end based, but I like algorithms more or creating functions etc. more. I liked working with DB and logical things. What would you suggest i should continue next? \n\nPlease note, I'm working in a completely non-technical field and I have around couple of hours every night to learn/practice etc. I wish to switch career in 8-9 years to technical field and this is my way of starting to build my future. I'm good with algebra, math, statistics, but never studied calculus or advanced maths. \n\nI wish to learn at least one language through and through - and I'm confident it's going to be Python because I have an attraction towards it for some reason. Any idea with roadmaps, books/resources would be highly appreciated. Please note, I have a very good concept of the basics such as data types, functions, arrays etc. I have also covered a lot of Harvard CS50 (up till pointers).\n\nThanks\n\nPS. I took a couple of online courses (Udemy, Coursera) - this video courses, I feel like, don't go deep enough of a concept and it only trains you for limited purposes.",

I have an Excel file with call information from a telepresence device and I need to parse some data and create reports. I'm importing it into a Pandas dataframe and trying to identify phone calls from one column (\"Callback Number\"), then change the value of a second column  (\"Call Type\") to \"Audio.\"\n\nThe RegEx I'm using is:\n    regex = re.compile(r\"sip:91\\d{10}\") #Audio call\n    \nBut I have no idea how to format the Pandas commands I need. If that ends up being a huge pain I'm also fine with spitting out a second DataFrame with just the rows that match the RegEx above. I've tried a number of things but I'm lost with how the Pandas code should work.",

I'm in the process of getting hosting and then i'll have this running on a webpage showing news, and maybe have a separate page streaming /r/all, and i'll probably have it wipe that every couple hours.\n\nI have a similar python script that can stream comments in real time from a particular subreddit or /r/all, and use keyword filters. \n\nIf i wanted to, I can easily make a bot out of these scripts and set up an auto-reply or do whatever to certain submissions or comment phrases.\n\nI dont plan on making any money off of these.

            "selftext": "Hi all! I'm relatively new to Python and still figuring out what IDE features I enjoy and using PyCharm right now. My last IDE was writing Swift in Xcode, which had a pretty awesome feature I'd like to replicate in PyCharm if possible. \n\nBasically the auto-complete/smart key feature was that when typing, tab selects the auto-complete recommendation (same as PyCharm) but also jumps outside the next bracket when tapped again (assuming you hadn't moved the cursor outside of the parentheses since typing the opening bracket). Let me explain visually. This is what PyCharm currently does:\n\n    print(self.m|)             #The vertical line is the cursor. When tab is hit, autocomplete triggers and yields:\n    print(self.method|)        #When tab is hit again, it yields:\n    print(self.method    |)    #the cursor does not jump outside the statement\n\nThe functionality I'm looking for is:\n\n    print(self.m|)         #same as above so far\n    print(self.method|)    #same as above\n    print(self.method)|    #the second tab completes the parentheses and allows you to continue on much faster\n\nIs there any way to get PyCharm to do this? I've looked into the auto-complete and smart key settings and it doesn't seem like there's an obvious solution. If not, are there any other recommended IDEs that do this?\n\n",

There are several python libraries dedicated to forensics that I can use.  I've already gave some thought to general file parsers (LNK, prefetch, important registry keys, recycle bin) but those all seem to simple for a complex final project.

Specifically a car dealer's website that shows its inventory on any given day.  I've played around with Octoparse and HTTrack but they aren't quite there for me.\n\nI don't want to just scrap data.  I want a reproduction of the website as it appears with pictures and all.  I'd like it date stamped so I can look back and print any given day's website.  And I'd like to have a scheduler so it runs at set intervals, e.g. the first and 15th of the month.  I don't need it to copy the internal links (\"click here for more pictures\") but I do need it to automatically go to page 2, 3, 4 ect.\n\nSo what do you think?  Does something like this exist or do I need to hire a smart guy to write it for me?  And if it is a create your own monster sort of deal, how involved is it?  Thanks for any insight.\n\n",

I downloaded the anaconda.pkg file from the anaconda website, and now i understand i need to go to the terminal (i'm using a Mac)and type \"conda install scipy\", \"conda install numpy\", etc so the files should be installed. I did that though and i still couldnt use these modules in PyCharm, and i guessed it's because i didnt install them in the right place. Sure enough, when i checked \"All My Files\", i found some 27,000 files disorganized there, and i'm guessing they need to go in some PyCharm folder.

            "selftext": "Hi,\n\nAnother continuation of my graphics experiments with tkinter. In my [previous project](https://github.com/irmen/pyc64) I've been using tkinter bitmaps to simulate a commodore-64 screen where I exploited the possibility to change the foreground and background color of the bitmap on the fly. This conveniently matches the way the Commodore-64 draws its (character-mode) graphics. \n\nThis time I switched to a screen filled with hundreds of tkinter's PhotoImage objects, that can display full color images. However continuing in the spirit of the 8 bit era, instead of creating something with high-res full color graphics, I created [a Boulder Dash clone](https://github.com/irmen/bouldercaves) using retro graphics.\n\nIt's a fully functional game. [You can get it here.](https://github.com/irmen/bouldercaves)\n(if you just want to play it and aren't interested in the code, get the .pyz Python zip app from the releases section and run that directly)\n\nThe game contains the 20 levels of the original 1980's Boulder Dash, and also plays music and soundfx. By default it uses a slightly more colorful sprite set than the original, but you can tell it to switch to the limited Commodore-64 color palette.\n\nYou just need Python 3.5+ and pillow and sounddevice/pyaudio to play it (if you disable sound, only pillow is enough). It runs very well at 30hz refresh rate on my Linux box, but seem to have some performance issues on Windows and Mac OS. Your mileage may vary, and you can tweak some parameters on the command line to eventually make it run smoothly.\n\nIt was a joy to learn about the inner workings of one of my favorite games when I was a kid, and how to translate that into modern software. I haven't been able to finish the game so far! I guess I have to learn again how to actually play this after 30 years.\n\nThere's just two things missing I think:\n\n- high score table\n- ~~being able to play multiple sounds simultaneously, as the amoeba and magic wall sounds are lacking at the moment.~~ *edit:* In version 1.2 sound mixing is implemented. \n\n(And the sprite set I used contains a lot more objects and creatures than the original game so it begs for adding extended game logic and levels with new mechanics... who knows...)\n\nThis project was heavily inspired by:\nhttp://codeincomplete.com/posts/javascript-boulderdash/\nand http://www.boulder-dash.nl/\n\n\nHave fun!\n",

The issue comes up when the channel/user creates a playlist such as 'Latest Videos' that includes videos from other content playlists. I use the --download-archive option per channel to ensure each video only gets grabbed once, but I want them in their respective playlists and not in the 'Latest Videos' playlist.\n\nI have tried using the --reject-title switch, but it only seems to apply to the actual video title and not the playlist title when feeding it the playlists url (eg. youtube.com/user/MIT/playlists).\n\nIs there any way to filter out the unwanted playlists (preferably by ID and not by title)?\n\nAm I wanting a feature that doesn't yet exist?",

            "selftext": "Apologies, either I can't google, the internet isn't helpful enough, or I'm just too stupid.\n\nSo I've been looking into buffering, in order to have a script save its progress by writing to a CSV file every time it gets around 20 rows to write, as I'm going to be running it on a VM that'll shut down after a certain amount of time if there's no user input.\n\nFrom my Google-fu knowledge, I (maybe incorrectly) understand that, in normal cases, when writing to a file, Python will buffer it until the buffer reaches a certain amount of bytes (8192 on my computer, as told by `io.DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE`), and then write to the file once it exceeds/hits that. The buffer size for a file can be specified via the `buffering` param in `open`. One can specify an integer to use as the buffer size, or a negative number to use the default.\n\nI calculated that, with the average CSV row that will get written, the ideal buffer size should be around 512 bytes (I read somewhere about it being a good idea to use 2^n numbers).\n\nI set it up as follows:\n\n    file = open(\"testfile.csv\", \"w\", buffering=512)\n    writer = csv.DictWriter(file, ...)\n\nAnd then call `writer.writerow` about 30 times just to be sure, but nothing actually gets written to file. I only get a `\"\"` when calling `open(\"testfile.csv\", \"r\").read()` (and a blank file when checking on the file manually) after all that. By the number of bytes being returned by `writer.writerow`, it should've hit the buffer in 10 calls, but none of it got written to file. I called `file.flush()` and only then did the rows appear on file.\n\nI tried the same, writing directly to the file instead of letting `csv.DictWriter.writerow` do it, but the results are the same. Nothing happens until I tell it to manually flush.\n\nI can't afford to manually flush every time it writes results, as it'd drastically increase the script runtime, and I really don't want to resort to creating another variable as a counter, as that doesn't seem like a nice solution.\n\nHave I understood something wrong, which would explain why this isn't working as intended? Another explanation could be that `buffering` dictates how many calls to write it'd take before actually writing, but when setting it to `8` and writing 8+ times, nothing appears in the file until I flush.\n\nEdit: If relevant, I'm using Windows 10 x64 and Python 3.6.1.\n\nEdit 2: Typo",

            "selftext": "Hi,\n\nI'm actually writing a little DAM image organizer with a feature of advanced tag searching. I want to be able to search per text tag with intersection and exclusion, as well as numeric comparison (greater than, lesser than, between...). It also has a \"category\" attribute that regroups multiple tags.\nI implemented a solution with sqlite. I have a table `Tag` which is just a key-value (with category as secondary key) and I implemented with SQL's intersect and except operators a working solution to be able to do all the kinds of query I need.\n\nMy worry is about performance. When I reach millions of tags, a simple query takes a second. And a fairly complex query with 7 intersects/excepts takes up to 30 seconds. It is expected to be much worse with dozen or hundred millions of tags, which would make my app totally unusable.\n\nTherefore I'm wondering what is the best strategy. Considering that my app aims to be lightweight and modular (sqlite can be replaced with another database engine or file based engine) but the default installation should use only the default python libraries to minimize dependencies, I thought of 4 possibilities:\n\n* Split my `Tag` table in multiple tables, one per category. I heard that sqlite manage much better multiple small tables than one large table. \n\n* Accept that sqlite can't handle well a table with millions of entries and switch to another database when this case happens.\n\n* Use a key-value store engine together with sqlite. But then, which engine can support the kind of search I need? And is there an engine that is pure python (no external library to compile) and that can handle querying hundred millions of entries with decent speed?\n\n* Not using intersect and except. But joins are much more difficult to implement, with only a few seconds of improvement. And search with 'WHERE EXISTS' or ' IN (SELECT' are even much slower than intersect and except. \n\nIn memory storage is of course not realistic because of the large memory consumption. My app should run on all recent computers, including laptops. So the memory consumption should stay low.\n\nDo you know any other strategy or tip to improve performance? Thanks in advance.\n\nLink of my project:\nhttps://github.com/gokudomatic/cobiv",

The developer logs show that it should be coming to PIP soon. There is also PyQT5 which is awesome, but the license is restrictive when it comes to commercial use.)\n- **Tkinter** (A quite popular GUI package. It uses TCL/Tk. I am concerned about how relevant this library still is in 2017.)\n- **Kivy** (I am not too sure how well the desktop apps perform, but I heard bad things about using this for mobile development. CMIIW. Kivy is quite popular.)\n- **WxPython** - WxWidgets bindings for Python. Looks very promising.\n\nSo, what I'm wondering is:\n\n1. Have you ever used Python to create a desktop application that you have actually distributed?\n2. Do any big companies actually use Python for their GUI application needs? \n3. What sort of problems/difficulties - if any - have you run into developing desktop applications using Python?\n\nThanks!",
