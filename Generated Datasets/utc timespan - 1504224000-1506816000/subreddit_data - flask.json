It's all in one file, works fine locally (accepting command line arguments stdin/stdout), etc. I'd like to make this program available to a friend, and so Heroku was suggested to me as a free and quick way to upload this. \n\n\nI then realized that it wasn't quite so simple, and that web servers and flask would be involved. Can someone assist me in this process? I'm on Windows, don't really understand Procfile, but *have managed* to get as far as seeing my \"hello world\" flask program on my local machine. \n\n\nI'm not really sure where to put my 'calculator.py', how to display a web form that accepts user input and gives it to my calculator program (I'm coming from a PHP background where I'd just do an all-in-one, not sure what the equivalent of 'form-action' is for python/flask), etc. \n\n\n\nI think what would help me most is being able to reverse engineer something similar. I've scoured Github and Youtube tutorials but can't find anything dynamic. Can anyone perhaps help me find a Github repo of something hosted on Heroku that takes in user input, does calculations, then outputs an answer? I'm literally just trying to make a calculator publicly available.\n\n\nThank you very much!

In high level terms, I have a User and a Unit.  I can have a form that will display a user and allow them to make changes to it, and I have a form that will allow a unit to be created or modified.  But as a separate step (and due to business reasons - performed by someone else), I need to set something up to associate a User to a Unit.  Logically how do I go about doing that in the best way possible?\n\nAs I think about it - I would want to pass a list of Users and a list of Units to an html page.  That page would create a single select option to choose the user to modify at the top and then list all of the possible units below.  On submit, the DB would update the User to be a member in all of the selected Units.\n\nI think where I'm having a problem is this - how do I have 2 different objects in 1 form?  And how do I have a multiple select list of objects (Units) returned from that form to be associated with the single selected object (User)?  As near as I can figure - my question is really on the html side of Flask.\n\nThanks",

While at first I started with a shared group ownership option of the project files, I found this to be annoying and prone to human error.\n\nI decided to convert the project to an svn controlled directory on a separate server where my production server and ourselves can pull from as needed, we can do local builds/testing and then tell the server to pull changes when we are ready to push to live, the concept is nice and seems pretty simple.\n\nI have the svn system built out how I like it however I am struggling with how to set up my Makefile, my plan is to have a few commands:\n\n* clean - go and delete all extra artifacts created as you work\n* dev - spin up a local flask instance for testing purposes\n* venv - destroy and rebuild the virtual environment, used mainly for new setups \nwhen you first pull the project\n* install - tell the production server to pull the most recent changes and then restart apache through an 'svn' user we all have access to\n\nThis is the simplest Makefile I can think of to do the jobs I want, as well as easily allowing for more support as time goes on if need be. \n\nMy problem is that I'm not exactly sure what the best way to approach 'make venv' and 'make install'. I have it set up manually right now and it works but it's just not graceful and I know it's becuase of my lack of knowledge in building a large python project like this. I've seen people use setuptools but I'm not sure if that's totally overkill for my project or not.\n\nDoes anyone have a similar workflow and/or have any suggestions on how I can improve my setup? I have my Makefile and install.sh script below for reference.\n\ninstall.sh:\n\n    svn up\n\n    sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart\n\nMakefile:\n\n    clean:\n\t    find . -name \\*~ -delete\n\t    find . -name \\*.pyc -delete\n\n    test:\n        FLASK_APP=octlive/__init__.py \\\n\t    FLASK_DEBUG=1 \\\n\t    ../venv/bin/flask run --host=0.0.0.0\n\n    venv:\n\t    virtualenv ../venv\n\t    ../venv/bin/pip install -r require.txt\n\n    relclean: clean \n\t    rm -rf ../venv\n\n    dev: relclean venv test\n\n    install:\n\t    ssh user@server '/var/www/app/install.sh'\n\nand just in case it's useful, my require.txt:\n\n    Flask\n    Flask-session\n    Flask-bootstrap\n    WTForms\n\nI know this is not the best practice how I have my Makefile set up, specifically how I am using make to call install.sh on the production server. Has anyone taken a similar approach to what I've done and if so what suggestions do you have? I feel kind of lost in how to make this better while knowing it isn't that good to begin with.",

I have experience with Django and have chosen that most of the time after hearing advice that Django was better for larger applications. Not that it should have mattered, but I tend to dream big...so, just in case, right?\n\nI am really loving this project and using Flask, which seems like the perfect tool for this. I'm using Blueprints to keep things organized and in a structure that is clean and makes sense. Now I'm wondering, at what point is an application so large that Flask wouldn't be a good option and what would make that the case? Even though a lot of stuff isn't built in as in some frameworks, there seem to be a lot of extensions that provide functionality. Plus, its really easy to write code in Flask. I have some trouble when the framework is too opinionated.\n\nAnyway, my main question is, does it have to do with functionality, or some inability to handle larger amounts of requests that it is often reserved for smaller projects? And about scalability, is it not able to grow with increased demand?\n\nI am really enjoying using Flask so far and love how much I can do in it without the framework yelling at me too much.",

The problem is that if I go to my analysis page, its great the first time.  But, if I go back to the form quickly enough and just submit the same info (or different) in a 30 second window, it processes the whole thing, and then it looks like the 'answers' output (a dict) contains more keys than it should, and these end up getting printed to the analysis page.\n\nThing is, if I wait more than 30 seconds, no problem.\n\nThing is, if I try to print the form data, it looks the same no matter what.  Or I'm crazy.  One of the two.\n\nHow the heck could my front end be jacking up my back end if the input form data seemingly stays the same?   And its not a problem if I just wait a little?  I'm very confused.\n\nThis probably wouldn't be an issue for 90% of my users, but if someone did encounter this problem, it would make them lose confidence in my project.  Help appreciated.",

I'd consider the data \"small\" (a table of ~50 rows and 3 columns).  The data and charts are generated by an R script that I have running outside and independently of my Flask app.  The R script stores the data as a csv file and the charts as images on AWS S3, which the Flask app loads and presents.  The Flask app does not write to the data set; it only reads it.\n\nThis setup works fine for now, but I'm wondering if I will experience issues as usage of the app (hopefully) scales.  Are there issues with the app loading a csv file instead of reading from a database?  Are there issues with the data and charts sitting outside of the app entirely?\n\nBeing new to web app development, I just want to make sure that I'm on the right path and not making egregious mistakes.  Apologies if my current setup is way off the mark, but I would appreciate feedback.  Thanks for your help!",

Unfortunately, vuejs' template syntax is identical to Jinja2, and I am getting variables-not-found errors when trying to pass the templates through Flask.\n\nJinja itself has `jinja2.Environment`, which would let me change my variable_start string and variable_end string. But I am confused how to...get to the Flask default Jinja2 environment to change this.\n\nSo, regardless of all the weirdness regarding whether this is a good idea (full static frontend for a Flask API, serve templated files via Flask and static Vue clients via Nginx?), I am just curious how to do this.\n\nThanks for your time!",
