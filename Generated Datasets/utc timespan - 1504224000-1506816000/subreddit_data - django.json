The examples were pretty interesting, and felt I could use them pretty easily.  Unfortunately, my experience wasn't as rosy.\n\n\nFirst off, there was the whole issue of where to place the `.env` file.  Documentation was less than explicit about that.  Eventually, I just placed it in the project root alongside `manage.py`, and added a `SECRET_KEY` line.  Unfortunately the major roadblock was the fact\n\n    env = environ.Env.read_env(os.path.join(BASE_PATH, '../.env')) \n\nreturned a `NoneType` object, despite my stepping through the `read_env` method and no errors occurring.  Couldn't use `env.bool`, `env('SECRET_KEY')` or anything else the documentation listed as examples.\n\nSo if you like this project and feel I'm wrong, can you give examples of were I screwed up and why I should look again.",

            "selftext": "I know one of the driving paradigms behind Celery and async tasks is to never have a task wait on other tasks, but in this case I can't see any other way around.\n\nSo, I have an app that's mirroring specific websites onto S3, and want to provide search capability with solr.  As a result, I have a workflow like this:\n\n1. FolderTask gets called with the folder ID for which a folder exists on S3 with a path like `bucket_name/folder_id`.  It grabs all keys with `(htm | html)` file extensions.  \n2. For each key, adds a task to retrieve that page, extract title and page text with BeautifulSoup, and inserts into Solr (without commit) within a group.\n3. Group executes on the specified queue\n4. Once all tasks are completed, execute a Verification task, which executes a Solr commit and query to see how many documents were indexed.  DB boolean flags and two integer fields are set.\n\n        \n        aws_keys = BaseIndexTask._get_keys(folder_id)\n        index_task = SinglePageIndexTask()\n        key_count = len(aws_keys)\n        tasks = []\n\n        self.logger.info('[{}] keys to index for folder [{}]'.format(key_count, folder_id))\n\n        for idx, key in enumerate(aws_keys):\n            tasks.append(index_task.s(folder__id, key, catalog_year, institution).set(queue = 'single_index'))\n\n        jobs = group(tasks).apply_async()\n\n        while jobs.waiting():\n            remaining_pages = key_count - jobs.completed_count()\n            self.logger.debug('[{}] pages remaining'.format(remaining_pages))\n            sleep(10)\n\n        verify_task = SingleFolderIndexVerifyTask()\n        self.logger.debug('Indexing complete, starting verification')\n        verify_task.apply_async(args = [folder_id], queue = 'verification')\n\n\nMy issue is `jobs.waiting()` can be fairly finicky, and only about 20% of the verification tasks actually show as running in the logs.  Furthermore, this current execution is a large scale batch job that will execute over about 15M web pages.  It is also intended to run after ongoing ingestion at a rate of about 25k pages/week.  \n\nI can use celerybeat to run a verification task continually to ensure commits execute, but that seems fairly wasteful and inefficient with such a low level of indexing over the week.  Ideally, it would be good to execute the verification task as a callback, like with a `chord`, but with just the `folder_id` and `key_count` as parameters.\n\nAny ideas?\n\n",

Or better yet, moving any kind of logic out of both into a `services` or `business_logic` file.\n\nAs I am working with DRF, my authentication serializer is getting kind of fat and it doesn't feel right. \n\nOn one hand, it seems like keeping the user validation logic in the serializer is intuitive because the view is asking `serializer.is_valid` and the logic in the serializer is part of helping determine that. Also not sure how effective it would be to have a `services.py` between the `views.py` and `serializers.py` (and haven't worked out the logistics of that).\n\nBasically, the `validate` method would be moved out of the serializer and into a `services.py`.\n\nMy `views.py` is basically:\n\n    from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model\n    \n    from rest_framework.response import Response\n    from rest_framework.status import HTTP_200_OK, HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST\n    from rest_framework.views import APIView\n    from rest_framework.permissions import AllowAny\n    \n    from .serializers import UserSigninTokenSerializer\n    \n    # Used for logging into the web application\n    class UserSigninTokenAPIView(APIView):\n        permission_classes = [AllowAny]\n        serializer_class = UserSigninTokenSerializer\n        \n        def post(self, request, *args, **kwargs):\n            data = request.data\n            serializer = UserSigninTokenSerializer(data=data)\n            if serializer.is_valid(raise_exception=True):\n                new_data = serializer.data\n                return Response(new_data, status=HTTP_200_OK)\n            return Response(serializer.errors, status=HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST)\n\nOn the other hand, my `serializers.py` is:\n\n    from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model\n    from django.utils.safestring import mark_safe\n    \n    from rest_framework_jwt.settings import api_settings\n    \n    jwt_payload_handler = api_settings.JWT_PAYLOAD_HANDLER\n    jwt_encode_handler = api_settings.JWT_ENCODE_HANDLER\n    \n    from rest_framework.serializers import (\n        CharField,\n        EmailField,\n        HyperlinkedIdentityField,\n        ModelSerializer,\n        SerializerMethodField,\n        ValidationError\n        )\n    \n    User = get_user_model()\n    \n    # Used for signing into the web application\n    class UserSigninTokenSerializer(ModelSerializer):\n        token = CharField(allow_blank=True, read_only=True)\n        username = CharField()\n        class Meta:\n            model = User\n            fields = [\n                'username',\n                'password',\n                'token'\n            ]\n            extra_kwargs = {'password':\n                                {'write_only': True}\n                                }\n    \n        def validate(self, data):\n            username = data['username']\n            password = data['password']\n            user_qs = User.objects.filter(username__iexact=username)\n            if user_qs.exists() and user_qs.count() == 1:\n                user_obj = user_qs.first()\n                password_passes = user_obj.check_password(password)\n                if not user_obj.is_active:\n                    raise ValidationError(mark_safe('This user is inactive.<br><br>Please contact The Company at <a href=\"mailto:admin@company.com?subject=Inactive Account\">admin@company.com</a>.'))\n                if password_passes:\n                    data['username'] = user_obj.username\n                    payload = jwt_payload_handler(user_obj)\n                    token = jwt_encode_handler(payload)\n                    data['token'] = token\n                    user_obj.attempts = 0\n                    user_obj.save(update_fields=['attempts'])\n                    return data\n                else:\n                    attempts = user_obj.attempts\n                    print(attempts)\n            raise ValidationError(mark_safe('The credentials provided are invalid.<br><br>Please verify the username and password are correct.'))",

One question I have from researching the ins and outs of Django is when should you use Django to do something and when should you use Nginx instead.\n\nFunctionality such as caching, Gzip, SSL/TSL, and authorization are present both in Nginx and Django. I'm a little confused as to which task should be done with which part of the backend stack. I know Nginx is very fast so I figured it would probably be better to try and have it handle some of these tasks but I'm not exactly sure if this is the case. \n\nCaching for example can be done with either but it seems like Django could provide much more granular caching than Nginx can since Django can do it on a per view basis. Would it make sense to have Nginx cache the static files and use Django to cache anything generated as a view?\n\n User authentication is present in both but I don't see how you could use Nginx to authenticate users if Django needs the use permissions to assign privileges. Nginx seems like it would be very fast and secure for this task but I'm not sure how you could tie this back\nto Django.\n\n The official Django documentation recommends performing SSL and Gzip via Nginx but I wasn't sure if there are any downsides to doing so. I'm curious about what are the best practices and would your recommendations are.\n\nAny advice you can give would be very much appreciated!\nThank you.",

He's been around a lot longer than me and only writes in VBA (which I don't mind for small projects).  I'm trying to convince him and others though that for some of our projects web apps are really the way to go (more powerful and more appealing to clients).  \n\nHere's my current situation - after creating a handful of Django sites over the past 18 months or so, I've been working on one for internal use at my company.  Partly because it's servers a useful purpose, but also part because I want them to see just what can be done with it in little time.  I've shown it to my boss and got a great reaction, now he wants me to demo it next week for the rest of the team.  The question I'm going to face is, \"what would we have to do to deploy something like this for our clients, especially since securing data on the web is not easy\".  \n\nI'm up to date on the security check lists and best practices, but what I'm really interested in learning is what else do companies do that deploy Django apps for clients.  I would think they obviously have some kind of insurance in case of a data breach, but what else?  Do they pentest their sites?  Do they hire security consultants?  Do they have security audits done, both internally and for their client's sites?  Are certain hosting sites better than others for client data? Or is it the case that companies tell their clients they need to take care of the hosting part, they only develop (seems odd, but I'm sure possible)?\n\n\nTL:DR - When deploying a Django app that holds your client's data, other than checking off boxes in the deployment security list, what else do you do to protect yourself and your client's data (insurance policies, pentesting, security consultant, audits, etc.)?",

May potentially sell to the enterprise (5,000+ users at an organization) although these may be on-prem installments rather than SAAS.  I've coded and thoroughly tested the app but have been reading about several standard SAAS multi-tenant issues.  Wondering what I should do?\n\nA.Multi-tenant Database Design\n\nFrom what I understand, there are 3 approaches to multi-tenancy:\n\n1)1 Database-per-tenant\n2)All tenants in 1 database but each tenant has own schema (own set of tables)\n3)All tenants in 1 database and all data in the same tables but all tables have ForeignKeys so I can identify which rows belong to which tenant.\n\nI have done approach 3 and it seems simple and works well.  I have lots of checks in my View code to make sure users can only see their Company's data (ie. query request.user.company and then filter data based on the Company).  \n\nI'm wondering about approach 2.  Is this something enterprise customers will demand?  Is there some regulatory requirement for this?  #2 doesn't seem that helpful from a security point of view compared to #3 since everyone's data is still in the same database.  If I do #2, do I have to make significant changes to code?  If so, what package would you recommend (django-tenant-schemas looks good)?\n\nIs 1 database-per-tenant easy to do using django/heroku?  Will some customers demand this?  Our team is definitely better at Django than managing databases.\n\nB.Subdomains\n\nWe currently have it so that everyone goes to example.com and sees their data only.  Will customers expect though to have subdomains company1.example.com and company2.example.com rather than everyone going  to example.com?  Does this help with security or scaling or just something to reassure customers that they are getting their data only?\n\nThanks all.\n",

            "selftext": "Hey, I am starting my career as a freelance web developer and I'd like to better understand how people are building e-commerce using Django.\n\nI did some research and have some questions about some e-commerce packages available:\n\n1 - Saleor - So far the best option I've weighted, but a couple of questions came to mind: It relies on django-payments for the checkout part, I live in Brazil so there are a couple of payment gateways that I'd like to use that aren't listed as supported. Is there a way to get around this?\n\n2 - Satchless - Seems like a good starting point for something minimal (selling digital products on a landing page), however the github repo talks about a major structural change and the code isn't updated in a while. Is the project dead?\n\n3 - Django-Oscar - Seems like the result is really nice, but couldn't take a look at the admin part as I never received the email to access it. I've seen some people say that this is suited for big projects and takes some time to set up (threads from 4 years ago). Is this still the case?\n\n4 - Hand Coding - Most e-commerce tutorials I've found teach you how to build one from scratch, but this seems to me that you are going to be rewriting the same code every time you build a new e-commerce. And also you have to make up your mind on a lot of stuff \"should my carts be session based? What should be the db structure? Should I have a Cart model? Or just car items model and rely on the session to persist the cart?\" And this can lead to making poor decisions instead of relying on a design that is tested and reviewed by the community. Does anyone hand codes every single e-commerce they make?\n\nAnyways, just wanted to know what you guys are using and your experiences with the e-commerce packages (I'll probably choose one to start but eventually will test every single one of them to make up my own mind). I eventually want to get to a setup where in less than a week I can set up a complete e-commerce for a small store (faster if possible).\n\nI am sorry if this question sounds like \"Hey, I am new, tell me what to use\" but it kind of is. I did a lot of research and I am tempted to go towards Saleor but I wanted to see what other people are using and why.\n\nRegards,\nJohn\n\n--- edited some spelling mistakes  ----",

So using an invoice for example, let's say I have invoice A in my database already and it has a few fields, then I get a webhook to create OR update invoice A, but I don't know if it's an update or just an additional webhook saying to create the same object. Right now what I'm doing is checking if the invoice exists already on my end, then if it does, I check each field against the data in the new webhook, and if they're all the same then I just ignore that webhook. If there is anything different, I create a new object and tack \"_updated\" plus a timestamp on the end of it (I don't want to overwrite the original invoice data so as to keep accurate/thorough records). \n\nAnyway, is there a better/more elegant/less loopy way to do this than just checking each field line by line? It's only like 9 or 10 fields so it's not a huge deal but I feel like there must be a better way or something.

In order to determine this, my approach is 'does this part of the system make sense as a separate service?' and I've come with the following:\n - Organization (details that are specific to the org, including offices, departments, etc)\n- Assets (anything that need to be managed)\n- Risks (anything related to risk, like default classification, controls, etc)\n- Audits (reviews of risk against assets, including actions and reports). This is the actual core of the application.\n\nDoes this make sense or am I overcomplicating things?\n\nIf I am to do this, what is the right way to write the Audit application, directly calling the models or (in my opinion, cleaner), creating business logic that abstracts those models behind an opaque API?\n\nAlso, speaking of models, is the accepted way of doing models having a single file with all of the models inside or should I split those once I get to the tens of models?\n\nThanks!",

When a customer wishes to change plans, I currently have it set up so that they have to cancel their current one and then sign up for the new one. This works fine but on the Stripe end I'm executing it by deleting the subscription and the customer and setting the IDs in my DB back to 'NA' so when they sign up again it just makes a new call to Stripe and makes a new customer and subscription and then updates the DB again with the new IDs. Again that works great BUT when I delete the customer I lose their payment history, old invoices, old charges, old subscription history, etc. So, I'd like to get around that by adding a couple models to my own database and also I plan to implement an upgrade/downgrade system with Stripe as well as an alternative to cancelling/rejoining. Either way I'd like to keep the customer's payment history in my own database just for completeness so I'm looking for a little guidance with how I should build the additional models. The components I am guessing I'll want to keep from Stripe are:\n\n- Invoices (which contain a customer ID, subscription ID, charge ID and invoice ID)\n- Charges (I just want the charge ID so I have a record of past charges I guess)\n- Subscriptions/subscription history for each customer(?) (Each one has an ID, and I can either change plans within the same ID or delete/recreate the subscription with a new ID/new plan in Stripe)\n- Refunds (Issued if a customer cancels the sub before expiration, and is identified by a refund ID)\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n- Each customer can only have one subscription at a time\n- Each charge is unique to a specific invoice\n- An invoice may (not sure?) have multiple charges\n- A subscription ID is unique to only one customer\n- A charge is unique to a specific customer\n- A refund is unique to a specific charge\n- Possibly others I'm not thinking of...\n\nSo, I'm not a database designer and I'm not sure if/how I should design this. I'm trying to figure out which tables/models I need, e.g. a subscriptions table, a charges table, an invoices table, etc. I most likely don't need them all and would like to keep it as simple as possible. So, any insight on how you would do it? \n\nThanks!",

Since all the sensors will be available across an ethernet, I'll just make a simple REST api for reporting updates and then use django/javascript to show system status on a display.\n\nDoes anyone have any pointers or suggestions for the above setup?

My ALB returns a 502 always. I've tried `http` as well, figuring it wouldn't work either, and it doesn't. My `ALLOWED_HOSTS = *` right now for django while I work on this. `http-auto-chunked` is also enabled per the documentation linked above.\n\nIf I take the same container and set the entrypoint to the Django webserver `./manage.py runserver 0:8000`, poof - I have traffic. ALB + uWSGI seems to be the problem.\n\nI'm scratching my head on this one. How does uwsgi need to be configured so it plays nice with ALB?",

            "selftext": "I finally made my way to finalize the first version of my web app! Now the question I'm struggling with is: how do I distribute it?\n\nThe app (Django + Django Rest Framowork + client with tons of JS) is of the \"final product\" type (not a Django reusable app) with, obviously, dependencies. It is supposed to be simply deployed on a host and served by a HTTP server.\n\nWhen I deploy a PHP web app on a server, I am used to deal with a single archive containing all the necessary files. I thought it'd be the same for a Django app, but I don't know how to handle the dependencies.\n\nSo far, the suggestions I've read are the following:\n\n* Create a Docker container. Seems neat, but a bit overkill;\n* Create a system package (RPM, DEB). Still overkill;\n* Create a Python package with setuptools. Many posts on SO suggest to go this way. Why? For me, it doesn't make sense: as I said, the app is a \"final product,\" there is no point to install it as a regular package (nor point to import it in another project). Moreover, dependencies are not included in the archive. And, if installed, how do I edit local settings?\n* Create a all-in-one Python package with PyInstaller. Seems overkill as Python should be available on a server. And I had a hard time to get it working;\n* Do nothing, just create an archive of the repo, with no dependencies, and put documentation to set the project up.\n\nI'm very perplex.

Like /2017/ shows all the sessions of this year, /2017/sep/ shows this month sessions, and /2017/sep/09 the data for this session.\n\nThis is my urls.py\n\n    url(r'^(?P<year_slug>[0-9]{4})/$', views.by_year, name='by_year'),\n    url(r'^(?P<year_slug>[0-9]{4})/(?P<month_slug>[\\w-]+)/$', views.by_month, name='by_month'),\n    url(r'^(?P<year_slug>[0-9]{4})/(?P<month_slug>[\\w-]+)/(?P<day_slug>[\\w-]+)/$', views.by_day, name='by_day'),\n\nI already kind of made it, I added three ForeignKey to my sessions model, pointing to Year, Month, and Day. Then I added three column to the database and added the value for each one, like if it's in 2017 it will be a 1, if it's in 2018 it's gonna be a two, and so on for months and days.\n\nI feel like this is far from optimal. Can't I do that by using the 2017-09-09 which is in the date column, instead of adding three tables to the database?\n\nOr is there even a totally different way to achieve this? (I tried {Year,Month,Day}ArchiveView but I wasn't able to make my own queries (like to get the total distance for one month)\n\nMy second question is, even if I go that way, I'm able to display the total distance for august in 2017/08/ by using the month_slug, but how can I do that in /2017/ ? I mean I understand I can't use the month_slug, but since I have sessions classed by month using {% ifchanged %}, isn't it possible to display the total distance for each month ?\n\n\nI would appreciate some help here, thanks in advance and sorry for the wall of text.",

            "selftext": "Hi there,\n\nI'm implementing a payment system on my site and I'm wondering what the best practice way to handle exceptions would be. The exception handling for CC processing is built into the payment processor (Stripe), so that part's not a problem. What I'm trying to determine is what's the best way for me to handle an exception if one is caught, for example a card processing error (e.g. credit card was declined). \n\nIn the view that processes the card, it takes a token returned by Stripe, tries to create a customer, assign them to a subscription, and if it fails there are a number of exceptions thrown like CardError, AuthenticationError, InvalidRequestError, etc. In those exceptions I am able to trap the error message easily (e.g. \"your credit card was declined\") and then return a different template, like subscribe_error.html, which can show the error as a template variable. No problem. The only problem there is that the URL still shows the thank you URL. So I really need to redirect to the error url (e.g. /subscribeerror or whatever), but keep the error message. So what's the best practice way to do this?\n\nBasically, the error handling works, but I just don't know if I am doing it the best way I can. Here's some code: \n\n    def pro_annual_thanks(request):\n\n        token = request.POST.get('stripeToken')\n        email = request.POST.get('stripeEmail')\n        name = request.POST.get('stripeName')\n\n        customer_data = {\n            'description': name,\n            'card': token,\n            'email': email\n        }\n\n        try:\n            stripe.api_key = settings.STRIPE_TEST_SECRET_KEY\n            customer = stripe.Customer.create(**customer_data)\n            subscription = customer.subscriptions.create(plan=\"annual_pro\")\n\n        except stripe.error.CardError as e:\n            # Since it's a decline, stripe.error.CardError will be caught\n            body = e.json_body\n            err  = body.get('error', {})\n\n            print \"Status is: %s\" % e.http_status\n            print \"Type is: %s\" % err.get('type')\n            print \"Code is: %s\" % err.get('code')\n            # param is '' in this case\n            print \"Param is: %s\" % err.get('param')\n            print \"Message is: %s\" % err.get('message')\n\n            ### SHOULD I REDIRECT HERE INSTEAD? ###\n            ### HOW DO I KEEP THE ERROR MESSAGE? ###\n            ### I HAVE A URL FOR SUBSCRIBE ERRORS IF NEEDED ###\n            ### AND ALSO A subscribe_error(request, error) VIEW ###  \n            template = 'subscribe_error.html'\n            context = {\n                'error' : err.get('message')\n            }\n            return render(request, template, context)\n\n        context = {\n            'plan' : 'Annual Pro',\n            'custName' : name,\n            'custEmail' : email\n        }\n        template = 'pro_annual_thanks.html'\n        return render(request, template, context)\n\n\nI know a few different ways to do this, for example I could store the context in the session and then pull it from the subscribe_error() view. I could also use redirect() or HttpResponseRedirect() but I'm not sure which, or what the best practice would be. \n\nAny tips? Thanks! \n\n\n------------------------------------\n**UPDATE: HERE IS MY SOLUTION!**\n------------------------------------\n\nI extended /u/nicksil's suggestion of using the messages framework a bit. First I process the payment:\n\n    def process_payment(request):\n\n        token = request.POST.get('stripeToken')\n        email = request.POST.get('stripeEmail')\n        name = request.POST.get('stripeName')\n\n        customer_data = {\n            'description': name,\n            'card': token,\n            'email': email\n        }\n\n        try:\n            stripe.api_key = settings.STRIPE_TEST_SECRET_KEY\n            customer = stripe.Customer.create(**customer_data)\n            subscription = customer.subscriptions.create(plan=\"annual_pro\")\n\n        except stripe.error.CardError as e:\n            # Since it's a decline, stripe.error.CardError will be caught\n            body = e.json_body\n            err  = body.get('error', {})\n            \n            # Attach the entire error string as JSON\n            messages.error(request, err, extra_tags='json')\n\n        # Handle other exceptions here like API errors, auth errors, etc\n\n    # Redirect to the post payment view\n    return redirect('post_payment')\n\nUpon redirection, get the messages from the request, find my special \"json\" tag, and convert it to a dict. Add it to the context so I can use it in the template:\n\n    def post_payment(request):   \n        template = 'post_payment.html'\n        context = {}\n\n        storage = messages.get_messages(request)\n        for message in storage:\n            if message.extra_tags == 'json':\n                messagesDict = ast.literal_eval(message.message) # Convert the unicode error string returned from Stripe to a dict\n                context['messagesDict'] = messagesDict\n            # I haven't decided yet if I care about other messages. If so I would handle them here.\n\n        return render(request, template, context)\n\nFinally, in **post_payment.html**, I can call up specific attributes of the error to make it very clear what went wrong:\n\n    {% if messagesDict %}\n        <ul class=\"messages\">\n        <li><p class=\"h5\">Message: <span class=\"text-danger\">{{ messagesDict.message }}</span></p></li>\n        <li><p class=\"h5\">Error Code: <span class=\"text-danger\">{{ messagesDict.code }}</span></p></li>\n        <li><p class=\"h5\">Reason: <span class=\"text-danger\">{{ messagesDict.decline_code }}</span></p></li>\n        <li><p class=\"h5\">Type: <span class=\"text-danger\">{{ messagesDict.type }}</span></p></li>\n            {% if messagesDict.params %}\n                <li><p class=\"h5\">Params: <span class=\"text-danger\">{{ messagesDict.params }}</span></p></li>\n            {% endif %}\n        </ul>\n    {% else %}\n        <p> Thanks! You're signed up!</p>\n    {% endif %}\n\nObviously I need to build out the post_payment template but you get the general idea. Now I can just repeat the process, adding the errors for each exception and showing them dynamically. Feel free to let me know if anyone sees any issues with this! The only one I can think of is if it somehow spit out a sensitive param, so I will most likely remove that. Also, I may decide to split the post_payment view into two while still using messages...one for success and one for failure, just in case someone refreshes the page when it has an error on it so it doesn't tell them they're signed up :) \n\nThanks for the help!",

            "selftext": "I have created simple search page for searching users based on their location, primary skill and secondary skill. This search page is not backed by a form and only is a simple form passing parameters from template to the view.  So I had these two URLs until now: \n\n    url(r'^search/$', view=views.search_users, name='search_users'),\n    url(r'^search/(?P<location>[\\w]+)/(?P<primary>[-\\w]+)/(?P<secondary>[-\\w]+)/$', view=views.search_users,\n        name='search_users_clean'),\n\nand the template:\n\n    <form method=\"get\" action=\"{% url 'search_users' %}\">\n        <input type=\"text\" id=\"location\" name=\"location\"\n        <input type=\"text\" id=\"primary\" name=\"primary\">\n        <input type=\"text\" id=\"secondary\" name=\"secondary\">\n        <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Find\">\n    </form>\n\nSince the first URL above generates a querystring for the search parameters, I wanted to have a cleaner URL and added the second URL above which redirects to the same view but with named parameters. So far the view for searching users is like this:\n\n    def search_users(request, location=None, primary=None, secondary=None):\n        if location is None or primary is None or secondary is None:\n            return redirect('search_users_clean',\n                            location=request.GET.get('location'),\n                            primary=request.GET.get('primary'),\n                            secondary=request.GET.get('secondary'))\n\n        users_loc = SiteUser.objects.filter(city__iexact=location)\n        users_loc_pri = users_loc.filter(primary__slug__iexact=primary)\n        users = users_loc_pri.filter(secondary__slug__iexact=secondary) # split these for debugging\n\n        return render(request, 'search/search_results.html', {\n            'users': users\n        })\n\nSo far so good. Now I want search to expand to allow the following criteria\n\n - search by location: `/search/hyderabad/`\n - search by location _and_ their primary skill: `/search/hyderabad/data-science/`\n\nSo I added these two URLs, which seem to be correct, but the view is unable to handle the empty values for primary and secondary in the first URL and empty values for secondary in the second URL.\n\n    url(r'^search/(?P<location>[\\w]+)/$', view=views.search_users, name='search_users_clean'),\n    url(r'^search/(?P<location>[\\w]+)/(?P<primary>[-\\w]+)/$', view=views.search_users, name='search_users_clean'),\n\nI get the following errors for the above two patterns respectively:\n\nhttp://localhost:8001/search/?location=Hyderabad&primary=&secondary=\n\n> Reverse for 'search_users_clean' with keyword arguments '{'location': 'Hyderabad', 'primary': '', 'secondary': ''}' not found. 4 pattern(s) tried: ['search/(?P<location>[\\\\w]+)/(?P<primary>[-\\\\w]+)/(?P<secondary>[-\\\\w]+)/$', 'search/(?P<location>[\\\\w]+)/(?P<primary>[-\\\\w]+)/$', 'search/(?P<primary>[-\\\\w]+)/$', 'search/(?P<location>[\\\\w]+)/$']\n\nhttp://localhost:8001/search/?location=Hyderabad&primary=data-science&secondary=\n\n> Reverse for 'search_users_clean' with keyword arguments '{'location': 'Hyderabad', 'primary': 'data-science', 'secondary': ''}' not found. 4 pattern(s) tried: ['search/(?P<location>[\\\\w]+)/(?P<primary>[-\\\\w]+)/(?P<secondary>[-\\\\w]+)/$', 'search/(?P<location>[\\\\w]+)/(?P<primary>[-\\\\w]+)/$', 'search/(?P<primary>[-\\\\w]+)/$', 'search/(?P<location>[\\\\w]+)/$']\n\nSince the URL didn't redirect to the cleaner URL, I understand that the way the optional parameters are handled in the view is wrong, but I don't have a clue as to how it is to be fixed.\n\nAlso, I have tried making the named parameters have a `.*` at the end instead of the `+` to match zero or more, but it did not work.

If someone has some experience cooking and the first step of a recipe is \"Mince some onion,\" they know exactly what to do. But someone who is new to the kitchen needs to first be told \"Get your knife and cutting board.\" I need that level of instruction. \n\n~~~\n\nI am very new to web development and Django is what I am learning on. It has recently come to my attention that the settings.py file has some stuff in there that needs to be different in development than it is in production. I think I get part of the basic concept but I am still missing some understanding. Here is what I think I know:\n\nCreate a \"module\" called \"settings.\" Inside, create 3 separate files:\n\n1. common_settings.py\n\n2. dev_settings.py\n\n3. prod_settings.py\n\nEach of those files will contain different information depending on which environment it is for. This information is somehow copied from the original settings.py and then edited according to the environment it will be used in. Once that is done, you can delete the old settings.py. \n\nIf this is correct, then this is where I am stuck:\n\n1. What information is contained in each of those three files? What specific lines from settings.py get moved where and configured how?\n2. How do I \"attach\" the right settings file(s) to my project when I run it, locally or eventually in production?\n3. How do I control what is seen in Github when I update my repo?\n\nAnd then there is **.gitignore**. I am totally lost on this. I read a bunch of stuff but none of it is really making sense in a \"First, get your knife...\" kind of way.\n\nAny help anyone has on this is greatly appreciated. Thank you!! ",
