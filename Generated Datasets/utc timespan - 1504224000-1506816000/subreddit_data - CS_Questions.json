The iOS front-end, which displays the dogs profiles and chats, and allows users to send messages to each other. \n2. The server, which exposes an API to handle profiles and message request via HTTP. (GET, PUT, POST, DELETE, etc.) \n3. A relational data store, which warehouses the actual profile and message data. Profile data is stored in the users table on the account creation, while messages are being written to and read from the messages table constantly. \n\n\nWith this info there are two scenarios: \n\n1. The app takes off and is a major success, but users are complaining that the app is slow. Specifically, users are saying that the profiles are taking too long to load. How would you diagnose this problem and increase the performance, taking into account the three layers? \n\n2. After fixing the prior issue users start sending more messages and scheduling more playdates than ever. Because of this the messages are taking too long to arrive or arent arriving at all. Similar to above, how would you diagnose and fix this issue to increase the performance and reliability of the messaging system? \n\n\nAny help is appreciated. Thank you! ",
