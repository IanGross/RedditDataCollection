I've looked over a bit of the documentation and information about the language, but the [benchmarks](https://julialang.org/benchmarks/) don't exactly inspire confidence, and the [features](https://julialang.org/) don't seem to be all that unique to me.\n\nBe that as it may, I see almost nothing but constant praise for Julia, so I suspect there's something here I'm just missing; mayhaps the benchmarks are too narrow a metric, or the features fit together in a way I haven't considered, maybe it's a little too young for most projects to consider it for production, etc...\n\nSo I figured I'd just ask here:\n\n* What have you used Julia for?\n\n* What other languages had you considered along with Julia?\n\n* What were the ultimate factors that led you to make the choice you did?\n\n* Was there a noticeable difference in builds between Julia and other languages? What was it?\n\nPS: Sorry if this is a duplicate, I tried searching but didn't find much.",

Below reads in a CSV file containing the 3-month Treasury Bill rates:\n\n    TB3MS = CSV.read(joinpath(pwd(), \"TB3MS.csv\"))\n\nIn order to get rid of the nullables I have to map `x -> get(x)` over the DataFrame - which doesn't work, so I convert it into Matrix{Any} first - *then* map it, and then convert it back into a DataFrame. \n\n    TB3MS = map(x->get(x), Matrix(TB3MS))\n    TB3MS = DataFrame(TB3MS)\n    \nI feel like I'm missing something fundamental here because the above procedure is pretty inefficient and terrible.

            "selftext": "Howdy folks,\n\nI recently learned about this language, but I'm having a hard time finding more recent (within the last 6 months) articles about Julia or instances of Julia in production. I've looked over a bit of the documentation and information about the language, but the [benchmarks](https://julialang.org/benchmarks/) don't exactly inspire confidence, and the [features](https://julialang.org/) don't seem to be all that unique to me.\n\nBe that as it may, I see almost nothing but constant praise for Julia, so I suspect there's something here I'm just missing; mayhaps the benchmarks are too narrow a metric, or the features fit together in a way I haven't considered, maybe it's a little too young for most projects to consider it for production, etc...\n\nSo I figured I'd just ask here:\n\n* What have you used Julia for?\n\n* What other languages had you considered along with Julia?\n\n* What were the ultimate factors that led you to make the choice you did?\n\n* Was there a noticeable difference in builds between Julia and other languages? What was it?\n\nPS: Sorry if this is a duplicate, I tried searching but didn't find much.",
