I don't have a subscription so there is no way for me to get to the music without buying it.\n\nI have contacted Google. They say their specialist is looking into it, but I haven't heard back in three days. I have tried rebooting my device and clearing all data from Google Play.

After all the years of great customer support.\n\nMy problem began once I moved country. I needed to get some apps. Banking, public transport apps, take-away apps, general country specific apps. To my surprise I was not able to download any of these apps. Strange, it should detect that I'm in that country. Tinkered around, tried some work arounds suggested online. Reset my phone completely, factory restore, the whole shabang. Still no change. \n\nSo, decide, well last resort, get onto customer support. \nOk, so issue seems to be with payments.google.com\nAll my details are registered still in my old country, ok, try edit them, create a new profile for new country. Ok, now we are getting somewhere. But wait, still having the same issue.\n\nAfter much frustration and time consumed, I am now still no closer to getting it sorted out and I have been told there is nothing they can do, even to a higher level of escalation.\n\nThe main issue it seems is that I had paid subscriptions in Google Play, I've cancelled all of them. Issue I was told that that because  one of the apps was a yearly subscription I have to wait it out until it expires, in a year's time. (The other subscriptions expire soon)\n\nThe alternative I'm told is to create a whole new Google account and take it from there. When I questioned how this would be possible using the same payment methods, I was told it would not be a problem. So essentially, if someone were to steal my bank cards, they could use them and set up on another gmail account and it would not be detected. Some security there. \n\nSo I am hopeless as where to go or turn to now or even where to post this. Thanks for taking to time to read this. ",

I started getting these full screen ads while I was on snapchat, chrome, or any other app. I noticed they all looked and behaved the same and there was no way they were apart of the app I was currently using. I tried searching for ways to remove it but it is very vague and I'm sure plenty of other apps have this type of adware too.\n\nSo make sure you don't download \"Video Player for Android.\" With some help from redditors I found that was the culprit.\n\nIf anyone can help me report this that would be appreciated. This app makes Android look very bad to people who don't know how to fix it. \"iPhones don't have these ads.\"\n\nApp link: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.multimedia.player\n\nScreenshots: \n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/iD9Yh0m.png\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/gamBCL7.png\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/lUaOX5I.png",

I move the whole drive folder to my desktop and deleted the trash again. I now shouldn't have anything left in my Google drive, but it shows that I have used 8GB storage.\n\nThe only photos I have ever taken is with my Nexus 5x, which is set to upload to Google photos which shouldn't be connected to Google drive as far as I know. Google photos should be unlimited storage for a reduced quality.\n\nI notice that if you go to Google drive app and then to Google photos, that is the same as just going to Google photos app. I thought they might be separate and that I might have duplicated photos, but that doesn't seem to be the case.\n\nSo all in all, my google drive is empty where I have stored all my content on my desktop, but it still shows that I have used 8GB.\n\nHow can I track where the rest is? Something I'm missing? I'm considering to backup my photos to desktop too, and just delete it from Google drive/photos and see how much space there is left. Things just doesn't add up to me because Google drive seems empty to me.\n\n**Late edit:** Google drive in web browser shows that I have used 9GB where google drive software says 7GB. I have downloaded alll my photos and it wasn't bigger than 700MB. So where is the rest at? : o\n\n**SOLVED**\n\nDisk shows 0 now. I had to delete everything, even the recent folder which strangely still kept my files even though I deleted it and deleted it from the trash can.

I guess this happens because Justin was featured in some of Kanyes music, but I don't understand how I can say \"Play 29 STrafford Apartments by Bon Iver\" and get \"Monster by Kanye West\"\n\nThis happens a lot when trying to request bon iver. Ill either get a Kanye West song, or ill get another song he may be featured on (often James Blake).\n\nIve also tried to request a song called Heavenly Father by Bon Iver before and instead gotten a shuffle of random music following the logic \"Play Heavenly Father by Bon Iver\" > Heavenly Father is on a 'Various Artist' album > either \"Dark WAs the Night\" or \"GTAV Soundtrack\" will start playing, which are both listed as 'Various Artist' on Google Play\n\nI just pretty regularly run into weird stuff like this.

We want to move away from this and migrate users that are a part of these groups to email distribution groups that correspond to the function that the service groups were fulfilling.\n\nMy question is, is there a way to migrate the emails that are contained in the individual email accounts to the distribution group? I figure that this is impossible because a distribution group is not a mailbox anyway but I just want to be sure there's no technology that can allow users in a group to easily access the migrated email.\n\nOr perhaps can I archive and compress the emails and allow users who used to use the service email account to access this archive?

However, it did not say current, major specific, or cumulative. I'll be honest, my cumulative gpa is terrible (2.0). I had a bad depressive year my last year there and it wrecked my cumulative. However, I'm doing very well currently and my major gpa is good. Which should I/do I have to add?\n\nOr am I completely doomed?

Recently I bought a new phone, and now Google calendar keeps flooding my email with notifications for fake \"status meetings\" or \"branding meetings\", along with \"picking up the kids\" and stuff like that. According to calendar, I'm the organizer and creator for all these fake events, but I've never touched calendar in my life. I most certainly don't have any kids to pick up. I've looked and these fake, pre generated events continue infinitely years into the future. I've already tried clearing them all by deleting entire series of events, and tried disconnecting my email from it via settings(which gives me an error).\n\n\nHow do I get rid of all these generates fake events Google says I creates?",

They are happy to take the orgs money, but nooo, wont allow the org to control their own paid for product. What the hell do I do? Who can i contact? \n\nThe previous admin was fired, changed passwords, and left, and is now no longer contactable.  The recovery questions and emails are all linked to the previous admin. They are screwed and they need a solution, apart from completely taking down the apps, which i dont even think we can do without admin priveledges.\n\n\nEDIT\nUpdate!!! \nIts been resolved. The customer managed to transfer control of the domain registrar to himself, then was able to create the custom cname that allowed google to ascertain control over the hosting. YES!!\n\nOn a side note, g-suite admin console wont allow you to forward emails to another email address in the organisation. \nSomething exchange has been able to do for nearly 20 years.\n\nWay to go google you morons.\nYou to actually log into the account you want to forward and do it from there. so.. admin isnt really admin.\n\ngive me exchange. please.\nanyway, thanks for all the help people!!!\n\n",

Here is a [snippet](https://imgur.com/s7KEKKA) of this last conversation today. \n\nI have given customer support the tracking number for the return, and have offered to send them the  email that I received from them which contained the return tracking number. \n\nI have once again been told to wait while this gets transferred to the returns team. Is there any more I should be doing on this matter? I made the purchase with a Discover card so I could technically do a Chargeback, but would prefer to stay away from that option as I still want to use Google Express.

No idea why this is happening.  I know they just introduced the new sync software, and I installed it, but still the same.\n\nThis is especially pronounced with uploading newer versions.  For instance, I have an excel sheet that I use daily and I'm currently at well over Version 100, and it *never* updates.

Just search wristbands and they are always on the 1st page.

Look for an email that either confirms your purchase or explains that it can't be completed.

Will try entering PIN again tonight.  \n\nWe don't want to watch the film on Fandango, Vudu, Apple TV 4 Itunes, or Sony Playstation 3 because all those platforms are only letting you watch the film for 24 hours, not 48 hours like Google and Amazon are allowing for this film.  I would have tried with Amazon but want to give Google some love too because Google has a great free email service, and I always buy on Amazon anyway. \n\nDon't understand what's happening.  Could the problem be the bank sent me a newer debit card 6 months ago with the chip on it?  I no longer have the old-fashioned, non-chip, regular swipe card.  \n\nI know it's the right Roku 2 PIN because I have it written down, and when I use a fake PIN, I get a different, shorter error message from Google Play on Roku 2 saying simply that they cannot verify the pin.",

Immediately I thought that it had to be an extension, so I disabled all of them, and restarted Chrome. Poof no messages about coin-hive.com anymore.  \nNow I started enabling all my extensions one-by-one and restarting Chrome every time.  \n  \nA few moments later I came to the conclusion that an extension SafeBrowse was responsible for the requests made to coin-hive.com  \n  \nMy advise is to uninstall SafeBrowse immediately, and check if any of your other extensions try to communicate with coin-hive.com  \n[Can we all report this extension for malware?](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/report/obkfjhifkbhimlocpddgamonjihinpak)  \nI've posted this on /r/Google because not everyone here reads /r/Chrome",

Personally, I'd love to take on the challenge, however I'm constrained with my priorities for the foreseeable future.\n\nMaybe we can gather a group of people who are all interested in having such a tool available and discuss the possibilities.",

            "selftext": "So I'm a junior at a specialized high school in New York and have over the past year or so started to learn coding (I took a computer science class). After sophomore year, I realized that I wanted to work in software engineering and can't think of a company I'd like to work for more than Google. This year I'm taking AP Computer Science and pre-calculus as well as AP Physics 1. I plan on taking App Development next year as well as Calculus and any other CS geared courses. I want to know what I can do from the beginning of Junior year to get myself either an internship or job at Google. I know a LOT of people dream of working at Google but I'm hoping that preparing myself from a relatively early age can help me in the future. Some questions I would like answered are: does Google only accept the best of the best programmers, what should I do beyond getting a CS degree that will make my resume more attractive to recruiters, and how \"good\" of a programmer do I need to be? I'm okay at computer science in general and don't really find anything too difficult. I also enjoy coding (to an extent) and wouldn't mind working to improve myself at coding. I plan on doing Google's Computer Science summer institute after graduating and some sort of internship or volunteer work this summer. TL;DR: I'm a junior who has taken comp sci and wants to work at Google; what should I do?",

            "selftext": "**Background**  \nIn June, Anker's newly-founded smart audio brand [Zolo](https://zoloaudio.com/) announced their first wireless earbuds on [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1792059063/liberty-the-first-zero-compromise-total-wireless-e/description), including support for all three major assistants (Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant). However, after successful funding, they removed almost all traces of Google Assistant. Compare the current campaign page and website to archived versions, and you'll note how the only mention of Google Assistant remaining is in the promo video (which is really hard to replace on Kickstarter). In the last days, they have also removed support for Alexa from their website.\nHowever, when asked about it in comments and on social media, they state that there were no issues regarding Google Assistant, and that we should stay tuned for updates.\n \n**Anker & Google?**  \nNow, at IFA, [Zolo and Google annonced Mojo](https://www.blog.google/products/assistant/your-google-assistant-is-coming-to-new-speakers-and-more/), one of the first third-party speakers with Google Assistant. A blogpost on Zolo's blog was posted and then taken down again a few days later, as was the [product page for Mojo](https://zoloaudio.com/pages/mojo) (also linked in the Google blog post). Something's going on.\n\n**The theory**  \nAfter Anker launched their Kickstarter campaign, Google may have contacted them about the Bisto program. As launch was (as is still) slated for October 2017, the lower-cost Zolo Liberty earbuds would make great launch devices for the Bisto program alongside the higher-priced Quiet Comfort II and the new Pixels, also slated for an October launch. Anker agreed and started working on implementing bisto to their hardware, removing earlier mentions of Assistant to keep this a secret. To comply with some sort of bisto guidelines, they have now also removed their standalone Alexa support from the headphones, putting the Liberty+ on par with the Quiet Comfort II.\nWe're pretty sure more there will be multiple Bisto headphones, and the recent leaks of Bose's QC2 have made it clear that [Google won't be building them themselves](http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/09/06/google-app-v7-11-beta-suggests-next-android-version-8-1-adds-battery-levels-bisto-headphones-prepares-tweak-user-defined-actions-apk-teardown/). Besides, it would very much make sense to have some sort wireless earbuds in the bisto family at launch to counter Samsung's IconX and of course Apple's AirPods, given the new Pixels will likely not have a headphone jack.\n\nWhat's your take on this?",

I pay for the 100 GB of storage, and I store my photos on there as well - though I have a Pixel, so theoretically new photos shouldn't be adding to the space.\n\nI tried finding out what's taking up all the space, but I couldn't find anything out of the ordinary - and definitely nothing that would be taking up all 100 GB. It says Drive is using 68 GB, and Photos is using 28 GB. I really don't think I have 68 GB worth of Drive files. When I installed B&S, I pointed it to my normal Google Drive folder on my PC. Would it have duplicated the files, or just confirmed they were already uploaded? I'm not quite sure how to check, because in the web interface it doesn't show any duplicate files.\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated, I'm a bit unsure of where to go from here. \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af",

And the cable end near the phone port caught on fire. I am unsure if there was damage to the phone. Specifically I am unsure on the port condition. I have been receiving really poor support from google about this. \n\nI know I am using a throwaway. but i feel like i should try and let people know",

            "selftext": "Usually with google's software I assume everything will work smoothly, but I've been really shocked today at some of the issues I've been facing.\n\n1. Google sheets. I'm using an iPhone, and if I open a google sheet on Safari from a URL (rather than from Drive), I'm no longer allowed to edit it in the browser. That's annoying, but understandable. Fine. If that's the case, then surely it should be seamless for my already-installed google sheets app to open? No. Not only does it not open automatically, *there isn't even an option to open it from the browser.* The only option is to go to the App Store to install Google Sheets, which I already have installed. Ugh.\n\n2. Google drive. For the past several days, google drive's web interface has been incredibly slow for me in zipping the files pre-download. Again, its not my web connection that's the issue, its the backend zipping files prior to download. I tested multiple machines, browsers, and OSs, and they were all terribly slow. *1 hour* to zip a 1 gb folder *before* the download even starts.\n\nAm I complaining about free software? Yes. (Well, I do pay for google drive.)\n\nAm I just having an off day, or have other people been noticing issues like this? I feel like I started noticing many more iOS UI issue in the past 2-3 years. Kind of curious if both firm's efforts here are becoming a victim of their own success.\n\nEDIT: And if you use iOS Google Chrome to open a google sheet URL, not only can you not edit the sheet in the browser, *there's no link or button at all to link you to the app.* This is just shockingly bad UI.\n\nI'm not an apple guy at all, but this is just crazily bad.",

I am typically wary of tracking services. I use Chrome on macOS and Windows, but I am not signed in and I do not need the browsers to sync, for example.\n\nHowever, lately I have been running into Google's seemingly-arbitrary forced limitations on its services when you have this setting turned off. The one that gets me most often is Google Maps. Many features of Google Maps are disabled when your account has this feature turned off. Google Maps is my preferred mapping application on iPhone. So, I find this annoying.\n\nI know what Google says this feature does. I have had it turned off because I have always felt like my Google search results should be the same as my neighbor. The notion of my web content being tailored in countless invisible ways has always kind of bugged me. The notion of my search history being logged to my account (and easily correlated to my exact GPS coordinates) just seems like unnecessary TMI. However, I *really* want to apply labels to locations in Google Maps, which I can't do.\n\nI am curious:\n\n* Has anyone turned this feature on and had a negative experience with it?\n* What are the chances that Google is collecting this information *anyway*, and the switch is merely a control to allow myself to see the information which Google already knows? In other words, am I just fooling myself?\n\nAny input would be appreciated. I feel like this is a significant philosophical decision for how I use computers day-to-day.",

I've been on the phone with Google support for 6-7 hours at this point with no end in sight. Been using Android since the G1, previous developer for CM, and am close to packing it up and moving over to the other side due to this experience. \n\nSaga:\nSept 2nd: Ordered two replacement devices (will be referred to as black and silver from now forward). Thought everything was fine and dandy, but missed an email saying the black device was cancelled. Silver device pending\n\nSept 6th: reordered black device\n\nSept 7th: realized device was cancelled. Ordered twice more\n\nSept 8th: Ordered black device 3 more times, last one did not get cancelled. Silver device still pending and awaiting shipment. Asked them the status and they claim it's sitting in the warehouse awaiting pickup. They say it's packaged and good to go. \n\nSept 11th: Black device shipped, silver device still pending. Once again ask status and they say they'll look into it. Silver device cancelled later than evening. Attempt to reorder that evening\n\nSept 12th: Silver device cancelled again. \n\nI've previously had very good experiences with Google support, but frankly, no phone is worth the amount of frustration and time that I've spent on trying to get this device. \n\nThe reps lie. I've been told that they've definitely identified the problem every time. I've been told I'd be getting callbacks that never came, I've been told that it's a payment issue despite trying multiple cards. My favorite is that I've been told that the system is automatically cancelling orders due to Hurricane Harvey that hit my area. \n\nDo better Google Support. \n\nProof: https://i.imgur.com/HJxql1B.png",

            "selftext": "I used to love everything about Google. Eagerly waiting to try out whatever new product was about to be launched. If Google did something, they'd do it 20x better than anyone else. Fast forward 10 years and I'm disappointed more and more everyday.\n\nSeems to me, instead of issues getting fixed, more are introduced. Lists below sorted by my frequency of usage. \n\nGoogle Search: Every since June 2017 update, search results are wildly inaccurate.  It seems like the word match sensitivity has been turned up +40%. Search for anything now takes 4x longer. I couldn't even find lists like this one from other people about issues they are having with Google products. \n\nGoogle Keyboard / Gboard: Ever since the name change to Gboard. Thought I was going crazy. I have next word prediction turned off. Yet as I'm typing it changes correctly spelled words into different words. As I'm typing this, it keeps trying to change \"word\" into \"work.\"\n\nGoogle Hangouts: Bugs never get fixed. No search button. Convo history sometimes only shows 3-4 weeks back. Stickers and emojis are more important I guess. And how many communication apps do we need now? Allo. Duo. Hangouts Meet. Hangouts Chat. Messaging. Hangouts. \n\nGoogle Captcha: How many cars or street signs do I need to identify? It never ends. https://www.reddit.com/r/assholedesign/comments/63duqs\n\nChrome: Windows- Rediculous RAM usage. Settings screen is now difficult to use. Android- Allows sites to access vibrator. Eg. Scareware sites that vibrate my phone until I close Chrome.\n\nGoogle Now: Can't identify songs. What happened to personal AI / cloud search? \"ok Google, show me documents in Drive sent from Doug\"\n\nYouTube: Web app no issues. Android app always complains of connectivity issues that resolve after clicking retry. \n\nGoogle Music: Randomly switches out explicit songs in my playlists for clean versions. Toggle in settings doesn't do anything. Songs and entire albums disappear. (Licensing issue?)\n\nChromecast: Casting randomly freezes. No connection issues. I have to stop cast and restart it. \n\nGoogle On Hub: Can only be configured through app. No web app or interfere to adjust settings.\n\nAndroid Wear: Ever since 2.0 version- 1) Ok Google takes forever to initialize. 2) Can disable incoming call screen. Watch buzzes with my phone. For now, 99% of the time, my phone is in Do Not Disturb. And that solves this issue. 3) DND not linked. No option to change preference.\n\nAdWords Express: Says my ads are active. Account is in good standing. Ads are not appearing and stats reflect this. Haven't bothered to look into further.\n\nGoogle product forums: I have to sign in to my Google account to view posts now? \n\nAllo: In order to send and receive messages on the web app, my phone has to be on and connected to the internet. Allo web app uses my phone as a proxy. Wtf. \n\nNexus: Loved the 5. Loved the 6. Bought a 6P. 4 months later, green line on side of screen. Never dropped. Common issue. I didn't bother with a warranty claim. Not worth my time. \n\nAndroid Pay and Google Wallet: Stopped using couple years back. Gave up trying to add my cards. These products seem dead. \n\n\nWHAT WORKS WELL FOR ME\n\nAndroid: I have gripes here and there, but everything works fine. \n\nGoogle Voice: Most consistent and reliable service to date. Occasional choppy call. Otherwise, no issues ever. I use it as my main #. No one knows my real cell #. Been doing that since Google Voice launched. Spam filtering is so nice.\n\nGmail: No complaints. Works well.\n\nInbox: No complaints. Works well.\n\nGoogle Maps / Navigation: Used to take me to wrong places despite address was correct. Sometimes it will route me through areas I cannot access like gated private roads. For the most part, no issues. \n\nGoogle Calendar: It's a calendar service. Hard to screw that up? \n\nKeep: It's a note taking service. I even downloaded the Keep chrome app for my PC. Simple enough to not break?",

Basically whenever I log into my Google account it asks me for a unique code to enter which I get from my Google authenticator app which is on my phone.

I tried logging into the Google play store to re-download all of my old apps but I need to use the authenticator app to do, which I can't download because I can't log in. You see the conundrum. I logged in using a brand new account to download the authenticator app but it's asking me to scan some kind of bar code which I have no idea where or what that is. I can either do that or enter a manual key which I have no idea what is either. Basically how do I remove the need to sign in using Google authenticator from my Google account? ",

            "selftext": "I had this big long story typed up, but it got deleted when I decided it was too boring. The long and short of it is that my Nexus 6p had battery issues (a not uncommon problem), and through Google sent me a refurbished Nexus 6p to replace the broken one, the replacement too had battery issues.\n\nWhile the old phone just wouldn't charge, the new phone would reach 100% within a half hour. Only, it could stay charged for a mere ~ 90 minutes before shutting off--reading 25% battery. Whenever I'd connect it to a charger and turn it on again, it would show that the battery was still at 25%. Thankfully, was pretty easy to show this to the supervisor and have another replacement sent.  \n\nNow, I'm not going to say that this was a simple situation to deal with. It took time and effort to get to get Google to let me speak to a supervisor and work things through with them, and they almost left me to deal with Huawei just because the phone was a week past its warranty.\n\nStill, that's not the point of this story.  The point is that Google made it right in the end, and they did it because of their philosophy for customer service.  Everyone I talked to treated me well and was happy to make reasonable exceptions to their policy to account for my exceptional problems. No matter what criticisms I have with the process, they're one of the few businesses that live up to their reputation about being customer-oriented. It's why I love to deal with Google and not the phone's manufacturer (who would only offer to replace the phone's battery...for $300), and I made sure to tell everyone I spoke with how much I love Google and their service personally.\n\nJust thought that I'd take a moment to provide some positive feedback, since the internet isn't exactly known for being positive. \n\nAlso, check out the replacement phone that just arrived. I had heard my refurbished 6p would be coming today, but I didn't imagine it to look so spiffy and new.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/ukt0c9r\n\nThanks, Google. I'm sure that this one will work just fine.\n\n\n\n",

Creating and messing around with playlists is something that I do (or did) quite often. \n\nWhenever I'm trying to add songs from one playlist to another, it's easy to go through each song in a playlist in alphabetical order, so you can easily know where you leave off. First off, I don't know why GPM doesn't just auto sort alphabetically but instead sorts by # (whatever that quantity means). Anyways, whenever I add a song from one playlist to another, GPM kind of just freezes for a second, adds the song to the playlist, but then automatically just refreshes the page, so now the playlist I'm looking at is not only sorted by # again, but it shoots me back up to the top of the playlist. So if I want to keep moving through one playlist I have to re-sort alphabetically and then scroll all the way back down to where I left off, which usually takes time because my playlists are long. And I have to do this for EVERY GODDAMNED SONG I TOUCH\n\nThis never used to do this!! It just blows my mind how counter-user intuitive this is. This makes the service almost unbearable. The only reason I still use this dumb (as it is) service is because YouTube Red is bundled with the payment. \n\nDoes anyone else have this problem? Why does it suck to use this platform agh",

Every once in a while I'll find an artist or group on Bandcamp that isn't available on Play Music, so I'll buy a song or album by them and go to upload the files from my computer to the app. Without fail, every single time I've had to do it, from when I was originally transferring my library from iTunes to Google 3 years ago to the measly two songs I went to upload 15 minutes ago, the Play Music app completely shits itself and doesn't actually upload the song.\n\nI'll drag and drop the file into the app, it'll say it's finished uploading, but when I check the \"recently added\" playlist and band page, there's nothing. I'll reload the webpage, still nothing. I'll drag and drop it again, still nothing. Close the entire browser, reopen it, and, after seeing it's still not there, drag and drop again. 9 times out of 10? Still nothing.\n\nAfter rinsing and repeating the above paragraph another 10 or so times, 1 of 2 things normally happens: 1) It will finally upload like it should have the first time I did it, or 2) I say \"fuck this\" and put it off until tomorrow.
