NetLogo seems really old. Maybe you'd something that will take less time to learn? Perhaps anything like Unity?\n\nWhether I should go with NetLogo or not, could you please give me any advice that would help me with this task?\n\nKeep in mind this isn't graded homework or anything; it's to help the Biology Department of my school.

Both are ripped by the same person (NTb), are the same format/container/audio and have the same runtime and subtitles.\n\nI think the WEB-DL actually looks a tiny bit better, but I'm not totally sure. Looks like the colours are a tad brighter, but I could be imagining things. Interesting though, as that's the one that's about a gigabyte less!\n\nI also have a different WEBRip of the same episode that is also 1920x960 - looks the same in every way, except it's an extra 300 MB. I swear it looks exactly the same.\n\nJust finished watching the series on Netflix and wanted to test the quality difference between Netflix and other sources - all three of these look way better than Netflix (that could be my shitty Australian internet though).\n\nSorry for the rant, basically I'm just curious as to what makes the files different, quality wise. It doesn't seem to me that the WEBRip has anything that the WEB-DL doesn't - what would make the WEB-DL worth having over the WEBRip?",

No social network integration no \"add-on apps\" for things like Evernote, OneNote, etc. no integrated Google, Yahoo!, etc sign in experience. Just lets me configure my email and password, the receiving and sending servers, and that's it. Plus points if it supports PGP, HTML editing, multiple email accounts. I'm looking for something lightweight but reliable and have a bit of a modern look.\n\nWhat I've tried so far:\n\n* [Built in Mail app for Windows 10](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/mail-and-calendar/9wzdncrfhvqm)  \nReally unreliable. Unpredictable syncing for emails and recently, it has started double-sending my emails. The options are very limited. Can't even set an HTML signature but the default signature has HTML link that happily advertises Windows 10 so it's possible, you just can't use it on your own signatures.\n* [Thunderbird](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/)  \nPretty good but a bit heavy and it has a lot of bells and whistles that I think it could do without and help with making it more lightweight.\n* [Mailbird](https://www.getmailbird.com/)  \nHas the same bloating in features that I can do without like the ones I stated above, also pretty heavy on a low-end system.\n* [Foxmail](http://www.foxmail.com/)  \nSomewhat unreliable too and the interface feels sluggish.\n* [inky](https://inky.com/)  \nAlso slow and has the same bloat problem Mailbird has.\n* [Becky! Mail 2](http://www.rimarts.co.jp/becky.htm)  \nThis actually hits all the right spots. If you go to the settings you get myriads of options probably 10x more than what you find on Windows 10's Mail app but all of them are related to email handling. All while just staying under 9mb in total for the installation folder. The only downside is the user interface looks pretty dated.\n\nI just want a modern-looking client that has the complexity for meticulous email handling while not giving in and including unrelated features.",

Can't copy files that are in use?\n\n**Syncthing** - looks complicated\n\n**Duplicati** - Works through web panel. It's ok. Like Cobian but with cloud storage. Not exactly a replacement for odrive since it's not automatic, but scheduled. \n\n**Rclone** - Command line tool. GUI is not complete, still need cmd line. No auto sync?\n\n**rsync** - Unix\n\n**GoodSync** - Free version locks itself after 100 files. \n\n**FreeFileSync** - recommended often. Adware install (unchecked it and it still installed that crap in my browsers). Doesn't backup to OneDrive: https://www.freefilesync.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=651 \n\n**Cobian Backup** - not able to sync to cloud providers?\n\n**Onedrive PC app** - Don't want to login to windows with my Microsoft online account. \n\n",

A 1 megapixel image is quite large. I really only need an image to be about 2'' by 2''. They don't need to be super sharp. Also, I need to be able to make comments or write captions with these photos. Lastly, I need to be able to save my new file in some format that can be converted to a pdf.\n\nWord does most of these things, but it doesn't let me import and resize multiple photos at one time.\nPower point does these things, but all of the photos populate right on top of each other, and my computer freezes up trying to render the photos.\nPaint does these things, but It only allows me to manipulate one image at a time for resizing.\n\nDoes what I need exist?\n",

The icon was also located on the bottom right of my screen but only popped up when he used it.

Does such a program exist?? \n\nI'm using windows so a windows app is what I'm looking for. I have heard of Lightroom, and adobe photoshop, but haven't bought those yet or tried them out.\n\nI did read up that Lightroom does have facial recognition, and eventually want to incorporate metadata to these photos, etc.\n\nThoughts??

The database contains archived science data and the main requirement is that the UI will be usable for long-term access (e.g. decade). Ideally, the development language will not become obsolete or decrease in usage during the lifetime of the archive so it can be maintained. \n\nSo far I seem to be excluding platforms/languages rather than finding viable candidates:\n\n1. PHP is too prone to security attacks. It is hard to ensure that the latest PHP version will be applied every time a security vulnerability surfaces. Plus I am still mad at how newer versions of Symfony have not been backward compatible with prior versions.\n\n2. Python and Django. Love Python although the time it has taken to go from 2.x to 3.x has been disappointing as has been the incompatibility between versions. Django seems nice but it is so convoluted to even set up I am not that optimistic about its survival.\n\n3. Java is out of the question, I just hate it.\n\nAny suggestions recommendations?",

A potential feature of the program could be loading up the video information about the next song so that there would be a smooth transition when the next song plays. \n\nWhy im asking so specifically is because i want the audio quality of my music in my library versus the quality found in the video but with the nice visuals of a video.

At the moment, it's just him so he would only need one user.\n\nHe needs something that will have the following features:\n- Save client contact details\n- Section for individual notes to be applied for each appointment (rather than a constant continuation)\n- Sections for Advice, Treatment and Progress notes\n- Options to mark whether a client has been contacted for their appointment\n- Option to mark whether a client has paid and in which method\n- Option to mark a clients referral process\n\nA calendar would be ideal but not necessary. Eventually, once the business has built up, he will purchase a more in depth CRM system but for the interim, he just needs something basic and preferably free! Another option I suggested would be creating a generic \"file\" with each of the points above and saving them individually a cloud (Google Drive?).\n\nI've done a lot of searching but as someone who has never used a CRM system, I'm not really sure what to look for so any advice would be appreciated :)\n\nThanks :)",

I know it was an unusual name, and I think it started with an A. The title bar of the software had two words, one I assume is the company and the other is the software.\n\nAs for the slideshow, it was nothing too fancy, exported as a 720p MP4 video file. As it was showing each of the slides, the background would contain a randomly chosen slide, only blurred so not to take focus away from the main slide. Oh and it had music in the background, not royalty free but chart music.\n\nI'm sorry I can't give more information, I've searched for months and not come up with anything and this is my last place to ask.

(Like 300+) all different.   \n  \nI've been tasked with converting these forms to HTML, so they can be filled out online, and then printed off to look *EXACTLY* like their paper counterparts. Think HTMLtoPDF.   \n  \nI can build the forms using CSS and tables etc.. All by hand in Dreamweaver if I have to. But I was curious if there was some program, some system out there that will let me build these pdf forms more rapidly than just literally hand-coding each form with its own CSS etc..    \n\n  \n\n  \nI would just pefer not spend the next 8 months of my life handcoding when I can drag and drop the forms.\n\nThink of it as a reverse PDF to HTML or how photoshop can take a PSD and convert it to \"html\" thought that's not the best solution. Or is it?\n\n  \n  \nAnyone have any ideas?",
