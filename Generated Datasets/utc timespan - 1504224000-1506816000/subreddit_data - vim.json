Vivid gives the user control and freedom over their plugins, by providing many options for plugin management.\n\nThe main differentiator between Vivid and other Vim plugin managers is the focus on lazy loading. By default Vivid does not enable any plugins, Vivid encourages the user to define and create the rules, for exactly when plugins should be enabled. These conditions can be as complex or simple as the user wishes them to be. In fact if wanted, there is a command to just enable all of the plugins to make Vivid behave like Vundle.\n\n*Vivid is essentially a lightweight, and \"lazy loading\" focused version of Vundle.*\n\n* [Vivid.vim GitHub page](https://github.com/axvr/Vivid.vim)\n* [Vivid GitHub README](https://github.com/axvr/Vivid.vim/blob/master/README.md)\n* [Vivid GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/axvr/Vivid.vim/wiki)\n* [Vivid Wiki - FAQ](https://github.com/axvr/Vivid.vim/wiki/FAQ)\n* [Vivid Wiki - Installing Vivid](https://github.com/axvr/Vivid.vim/wiki/Installing-Vivid)\n* [Vivid Wiki - Managing plugins](https://github.com/axvr/Vivid.vim/wiki/Managing-Plugins)\n\nAny feedback would be greatly appreciated, thanks.\n\n**NOTE: Vivid does not work on Windows systems yet** (help is wanted)",

I know how to use Gdiff to compare two branches, but I can't seem to accomplish basically this:\n\n    :read myfile.c on branch master\n\nI realise this might be a super easy thing to do, I just haven't used vim and git together much.

It works great:\n\n```\nmap <Leader>r :!bundle exec rspec %<CR>\n```\n\nSometimes, though, you might not be interested in running the whole spec. Rspec's got you covered here: if you append `:<line number>` to the file name it'll run the tests on the specified line (roughly speaking).\n\nSo with that in mind I added the following:\n\n```\nmap <Leader>R :!bundle exec rspec %:<C-r>=line(\".\")<CR>\n```\n\nYep, nice!\n\nLet's run a test on line 153, cos, why not. Rspec says this:\n\n```\n\"./spec/stuff/stuff_controller_spec.rb\"=>[153]\n```\n\nAs expected.\n\nAll well and good, until by chance I tried the same on line 84 (`:!bundle exec rspec %:84` if the final `<CR>` wasn't there). Here's what I got from Rspec:\n\n```\nLoadError:  \n  cannot load such file -- ./spec/stuff/stuff_controller_spec.rb4\n```\n\nSo basically whenever the line number starts with an 8, vim seems to remove `:8` from command. Same thing happens when I type the whole thing into command mode.\n\nI am at a complete loss - what gives!?\n\n(ps here's the output of the version command: \n`VIM - Vi IMproved 8.0 (2016 Sep 12, compiled Feb  6 2017 06:58:11) MacOS X (unix) version`)",

I had to change some stuff on a few websites (boring part of this job but oh well) and using vim it went extremely fast, even though I am still very clunky with moving and stuff.\n\nToday my buddy who works at the same company told me to 'drop that crap and use a normal editor' and wanted to bet on him writing the same code 2 times faster with textmate than I could do in vim, I said I would probably win when I get used to vim but that I didn't know when that would be.\n\nAfter this I kept using vim throughout the day and didn't really notice much on productivity. It does feel awkward at some points but I believe I am already getting better. but it made me think, is it really worth taking that time to learn vim while I can just keep using a boring GUI editor?\n\nTo be honest I just picked up vim because I got bored in my lunch break and wanted to play around but I instantly got hooked on using it. I already have multiple plugins to make it work pretty much exactly like I'm used to I other editors (filetree autocompletion etc.)\n\nI do notice I have way more fun using vim.\nSo can give me some motivation to keep learning vim :D\n(And yes I know this post was long)\n\nTl;dr: I want some motivation to learn vim and maybe become a great vim user in the future. :D",

            "selftext": "I've had problems with tmux before where hitting `<Esc>`/`<C-]>` to exit insert mode comes with a little delay. I'm pretty sure I'd fixed it previously with \n\n    set -s escape-time 0\n\nbut it seems to be happening again. I've confirmed that this option is set correctly with\n\n    show -s escape-time\n\nbut still no dice.\n\nHere's a detailed description of the problem: just after exiting insert mode, if I hit any other keys, they will appear on the line after the cursor, and after a second or so, the corresponding normal mode command will be performed. For example:\n\n                          Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Vestibulum eget semper\n    CURSOR STARTS HERE -> jjjjjquis semper nibh. Integer massa metus, fringilla in aliquet in, pulvinar\n                          non enim. Proin at placerat mi. Pellentesque dui justo, sodales eget pretium\n                          nec, congue eu libero. Sed sit amet sollicitudin augue. Orci varius natoque\n                          penatibus et magnis dis parturient montes, nascetur ridiculus mus. Duis\n                          fringilla turpis at urna cursus, at ultricies turpis laoreet. Ut pellentesque\n      CURSOR ENDS HERE -> mollis velit ut viverra. \n\nThe ghost `jjjjj` will remain on the screen until I clear it with `<C-l>`\n\nWhat's weirder is that it doesn't happen in a fresh vim session, but after I've been working for a bit, it might stop and then not go away.\n\nAny ideas on how to diagnose this issue?",

            "selftext": "Hi All,\n\nRecent sublime convert here. I have this annoying bug where when I yank my indented code and paste with p, my code indents properly, but when I paste using the cntrl-r \" shortcut the indentation is way off (picture attached). Anyone have and quashed a similar bug? I attached a picture of problem in the link below the along with my [VIMRC] (https://pastebin.com/Jg2qK3mM). I'm only using vim-sensible, vim-vinegar, ALE, lightline, and the gruvbox theme. I figured this may be a vim-quirk rather than vimrc configuration file, but I'm sorry if this should have gone in the weekly sticky.\n\nLink: https://imgur.com/a/QintW\n\nEdit: To clarify I am *not* trying to paste from the system clipboard into vim, but rather yanking lines into a vim register and then pasting that from within vim. Set paste seems to resolve the issue; I'm still trying to come up with the cleanest implementation (toggling it off and on everytime I want to copy a block of code seems a bit clunky) and appreciate all of the suggestions thus far.\n\nEdit 2: In addition to set paste, you can also type cntrl-r cntrl-o {register} to enable pasting without autoindentation. That way, if you paste code that is already appropriately indented, vim won't try to \"reindent\" the code leading to the problem I was having. Cntrl-r cntrl-p pastes without autoindentation, but won't match the indentation level of the block you are pasting into.",

In fact it \"should\" be easy to distinguish Case 1 from Case 3, as Case 1 always (AFAICT?) has a closing parenthesis just before the opening brace (excluding whitespace) (... and you may also want to check whether the word *before* the previous word is struct/class/union/namespace).\n\nDoes anyone know of a setting or a plugin which would solve this issue?\n\nJust to be clear, I am not particularly interested in plugins that shell out to clang-format and other external tools, because these are far too opinionated and rigid IMO.\n\nThanks!",

I don\u2019t really want either \u2013 a directory full of Markdown files will do just fine for me.\n\nWhat I *do* want is a sidebar that *lists* the notes (i.e. files) and automatically opens whichever file the cursor is on into a fixed other window. I\u2019m not asking for a simple file browser \u2013 I know about Netrw and NERDtree and have written [readdir](https://github.com/ap/vim-readdir) myself. The point is I don\u2019t want to open files explicitly. I want putting the cursor on a file in the sidebar window to automatically open it in the other window.\n\nYou know [how Apple Notes works (or the myriad of similar programs)](https://images.techhive.com/images/article/2016/04/notes-yellow-links-100654773-orig.png)? That\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about: a vertical split with the list of files in one window and the selected file in the other.\n\nBasically the point of the plugin I want is opening a directory and then working on any/all files in it without opening or closing them individually.\n\nDoes such a thing already exist, or do I get to do the honours myself?",

            "selftext": "The following is a power 100% unique to vim's ex mode; you can't do this using editor commands in any other editor -- it usually requires writing a script in editors like Emacs, and you literally can't do it at *all* in unscriptable editors, you just have to do such things slowly and laboriously, manually.\n\nThis is powerful enough to drive editor choice, if one embraces it.\n\nThis post is intended to motivate people to learn more about ex-mode by showing its power, not to serve as a tutorial to such a large subject.\n\nEx mode allows doing *arbitrarily* *complicated* repetitive edits to long blocks, a fact which is nearly universally unknown even with people who know all the ex-mode basics for doing *simple* edits.\n\nThe disadvantage is that the commands required are complicated, a little hard to debug, and nearly read-only, but that is totally outweighed in the cases where it can save hours or even days of manual editing.\n\nSmall example. Say that you're editing a list of page numbers in a table of contents, and the page numbers are all off by 22 (this actually just happened to me in real life, which prompted this post).\n\nThe key magic is that one can create a single-line compound command by separating individual ex-mode commands with '|', and then using the resulting compound command on each of many lines via the ex-mode 'g' global command.\n\n(For the uninitiated: vi/vim grew out of a line-oriented non-screen-oriented editor called ex, and vim still has its complete set of ex editing commands in ex mode, that are unlike the usual vim commands. I don't have the time to do a regular expression intro, nor an \"intro to ex-mode for people who previously haven't noticed that it exists let alone that it is worth using\", does anyone have a pointer for people?)\n\nSo from here we'll assume the reader knows the basics of both regular expressions and of vim's ex-mode.\n\nAlso the bash shell is used in this particular example, although the technique does not generally require the shell. It does however indicate the vast potential of using external programs in combination with editing.\n\nLet's say our text looks like this:\n\n    A......Page 23\n    by John Smith\n    B......Page 73\n    by Jane Doe\n    C......Page 131\n    by Alice Grey\n\nAnd so on...but these are wrong -- they actually should start at 1, so each page number needs to have 22 subtracted.\n\nI had 52 such lines, so the prospect of doing 26 edits, each one error prone due to mental arithmetic, seemed do-able, don't get me wrong, but annoying enough to prompt me to use the ex-mode approach, since I'm used to using it.\n\nIn other cases I have been faced with tens of thousands of lines of edits vaguely like this, which would take taken literally days or more to do by hand, in which case some form of automation is absolutely necessary, and this ex-mode approach avoids the need for writing a small software script -- which itself would be a nuisance and error-prone and vastly less efficient in terms of my time than ex-mode.\n\nIndeed this approach can make the difference between deciding to do something with a few minutes of complicated editing, versus deciding that the task is just too difficult or time consuming to do at all.\n\nSo here goes, here's how to write an admittedly-unreadable but extremely effective ex-mode single compound command for that.\n\nFirst I vi-mode mark the end of the text (mA to mark it with A), then I use ex-mode global command \":.,'ag/..../\" where \":\" starts ex-mode, \".,'a\" is a range of lines from the cursor to mark A, \"g//\" is the global command, and \"...\" is the global command's regular expression to choose which lines to apply following commands to, skipping any other lines (the \"by ...\" lines in this example).\n\nWe want just the lines that start with a capital letter followed by some dots, so that regex is /\\^[A-Z]\\\\.\\\\.\\\\./ -- regexes are infamously unreadable but are second nature with enough practice.\n\nWe are going to transform each such line into a shell command to do arithmetic while retaining the non-numeric text in those lines. So each line transformed into a shell command will look like:\n\n    echo $(echo \"A......Page\" ; echo \"23 - 22\" | bc -l -q)\n\nThe bc command performs the arithmetic (-q is \"quiet\" and -l brings in the bc library and sets the decimal precision -- unnecessary in this case but I type it by habit and is needed if you want non-integer arithmetic).\n\nThat line is piped to the shell for execution via \".!bash\" -- \".\" is the current line, \"!\" is the vim command to pipe text to an external process, and \"bash\" of course is which external process to invoke.\n\nThe line is then constructed by using the \"s///\" substitute command,with one regex to pick out the first non-numeric part of the text and a second following regex to pick out the numeric part. The substitution text uses \\1 to refer to what was matched with the first regex, and similarly with \\2, so the first half of s/// is:\n\n    s/^\\(.*\\) \\([0-9]*\\)$/\n\nThe second half specifies the replacement text to form the echo command shown above to send to bash, so the whole substitute is\n\n    s/^\\(.*\\) \\([0-9]*\\)$/echo $(echo \\1; echo \\2 - 22 | bc -l -\nq)/\n\nThat uses | in the bash command for piping. In the final command we also use | as a command separator in order to add a command tell vim to pipe the newly-created command to bash.\n\nPutting all of this together creates the horrendous-seeming command:\n\n    :.,'ag/^[A-Z]\\.\\.\\./s/\\^\\(.*\\) \\([0-9]*\\)$/echo $(echo \\1; echo \\2 - 22 | bc -l -q)/|.!bash\n\nAnd voila, we are done, the resulting text is:\n\n    A......Page 1\n    by John Smith\n    B......Page 51\n    by Jane Doe\n    C......Page 109\n    by Alice Grey\n\n....and so on for 26 entries total.\n\nDespite the unaesthetic scare factor of its appearance, note that this is far, *far* easier to compose than it is to read. I almost never save such things for reuse, because it is typically easier to re-invent a new complex ex command than it is to copy-paste-edit an old one.\n\nI composed and debugged it in stages. First I did a simple global g// command, then I edited it (ex mode has history like the shell, accessible via arrow keys to scroll up and down through it).\n\nI started adding s/// substitute commands to that, so it took a few tries to get the regex right and to finalize the strategy.\n\nSomewhere in there I separately debugged the form of the shell command that would work best.\n\nTotal time elapsed probably 3 minutes.\n\nIn more complicated cases one might do a whole series of such compound ex-mode commands, to get the final edit done in stages.\n\nAside from the resemblance to line noise, it is also perhaps slightly boggling in its meta approach, of making commands out of multiple commands to create commands to send to multiple commands.\n\nNow that I'm used to this approach, I use it frequently, not rarely, and again, this was a simple example task, but often what is needed is on much larger blocks of text with much more complicated structure.\n\nA related common pattern is e.g. \"1,$g/.../-2join|join|s///\" to back up two lines from each regex-match, join 3 lines together, and edit the resulting line with a substitute command.\n\nUsing relative motion like that with g// is extremely powerful but not at all well-known.\n\nI'm sure someone will say \"that's ugly, I'd prefer to just do 26 manual edits\" -- which is fair, but again this is a simple example of something that is essential when the alternative is thousands of manual edits (or writing complicated scripts).\n\nAnd again, this is intended to motivate further exploration, not to be a tutorial.\n\nPeople often argue for the superiority of vim's interactive commands, but although I agree, I think that ex-mode is a widely unknown and *certainly* under-appreciated, but possibly even more compelling, reason to use vim, in conjunction with its interative commands.\n\nApologies for undoubted typos in the above.\n",

The strange thing is that when I open the .vimrc file in Vim, syntax hightlighting works, but not with any other file. \n\nI ran the \"scriptname\" command in .vimrc vs other files and one thing I noticed is that all other files opened with Vim are missing the following scripts:\n\n24: /usr/local/Cellar/vim/8.0.1050/share/vim/vim80/scripts.vim\n \n25: /usr/local/Cellar/vim/8.0.1050/share/vim/vim80/ftplugin/vim.vim\n \n26: /usr/local/Cellar/vim/8.0.1050/share/vim/vim80/indent/vim.vim\n \n27: /usr/local/Cellar/vim/8.0.1050/share/vim/vim80/syntax/vim.vim\n \n28: /usr/local/Cellar/vim/8.0.1050/share/vim/vim80/syntax/perl.vim\n \n29: /usr/local/Cellar/vim/8.0.1050/share/vim/vim80/syntax/pod.vim\n \n30: /usr/local/Cellar/vim/8.0.1050/share/vim/vim80/syntax/ruby.vim\n \n31: /usr/local/Cellar/vim/8.0.1050/share/vim/vim80/syntax/python.vim\n\nAfter running some of these scripts manually using the \"Source\" command, syntax highlighting does seem to kick in, but that would be a pain to do every single time I open a file to edit.\n\nAny help would be much appreciated.\n\n\n",

Nothing has been decided yet, but here are the current ideas being bounced around. \n\n- De-emphasis of stickies and sidebar, they are generally not seen / overlooked.\n- More focus on building out evergreen answers on the wiki (opening up wiki a bit maybe?).  I am concerned this will possibly end as pointless duplication and competition with http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/ -- what do you think?  The goal is to be able to quickly link to answers rather than having to rehash them. \n- Implementing a fairly firm no assholes rule.  This means banning people with a **pattern** of poor behavior, not for a one off bad comment / day.  This will **not** be backward looking but from implementation point forward, everyone will have a clean slate.  Disagreement isn't being an asshole, personal attacks are.  Sincere arguments focused on the tech will always been allowed.  \"I recommend instead of plugin $X you use feature $Y\" isn't being an asshole.  \"You are stupid because you use plugin $X instead of feature $Y\" is.  No more platform/language/gui shaming, etc. \n- Weekly DYK (Did You Know) -- to point out things Vim already does out of the box, and discussion around it. \n- Weekly Tip -- this can be a plugin, workflow or general tip and discussion around it. \n- Monthly Vimrc review thread -- obvious enough!\n- Bring on the bots -- the tips, DYK and Vimrc review thread will be automated by bots (pre-loaded) and various other tasks as well as can be will be automated.\n\n... looking for more ideas ... \n\nSome ideas from the community likely to be done as well!\n\n- Weekly Everything About ____  -- /u/sudo_bang_bang\n- New Theme and Banner -- /u/AGodWithNoName",

This is just a plugin that gives each window / split you have open its own personal ordered history of the buffers that have been open, and lets you easily traverse it with two customizable key bindings for going back and forward.\n\nYou even get little arrows for your status line to indicate whether you can go back/forward in your buffer history at any given moment, if you want to put them in there :).\n\nIf you decide to try this out, even for the sake of criticizing it, it would be greatly appreciated! Any code review at all is very generous and would be welcome (if anyone can tell me why the bufenter autocmd wasn't working for my purposes I'd love to know). Also if you have any advice about my testing methods, which you can view in the \"tests\" directory, I would love to hear it!\n\n\nLastly, I'm aware that there are some older plugins that do something similar to this, or are slightly different solutions to the same problem, but I wanted to take this opportunity to get my vimscripting feet wet (I think this is actually a good project to do so if you're in a similar mood). I also want to make this somewhat customizable via settings, and ultimately more stable via testing.\n\nThanks!",

I have recently decided to try out vim proper to get more functionality that is not available with the VSC plugin. However, I am having a pretty difficult time getting it set up in its most basic configuration.\n\nI have installed MacVim using Homebrew, however, whenever I launch mvim from the terminal, the working directory is always my home directory. This can be seen with :pwd. Launching vim in the terminal shows the directory from which it was launched as expected. This makes attempting to open files within the same project extremely cumbersome.\n\nI cannot find an answer after googling for hours. I figured this would be a good place to ask for help :) \n\nI feel like I am so close to being able to switch over, but just getting it to work at a usable level has been frustrating.\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks!",

Ut enim ad minim \n    - Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt \n    dolore magna aliqua.

Ut enim ad minim \n    - Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt \n      dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim \n\nIdeally this would work appropriately with checkboxes and numbered lists as well.

Ut enim ad minim \n    - [ ] Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt \n    dolore magna aliqua.

            "selftext": "The following is a power 100% unique to vim's ex mode; you can't do this using editor commands in any other editor -- it usually requires writing a script in editors like Emacs, and you literally can't do it at *all* in unscriptable editors, you just have to do such things slowly and laboriously, manually.\n\nThis is powerful enough to drive editor choice, if one embraces it.\n\nThis post is intended to motivate people to learn more about ex-mode by showing its power, not to serve as a tutorial to such a large subject.\n\nEx mode allows doing *arbitrarily* *complicated* repetitive edits to long blocks, a fact which is nearly universally unknown even with people who know all the ex-mode basics for doing *simple* edits.\n\nThe disadvantage is that the commands required are complicated, a little hard to debug, and nearly read-only, but that is totally outweighed in the cases where it can save hours or even days of manual editing.\n\nSmall example. Say that you're editing a list of page numbers in a table of contents, and the page numbers are all off by 22 (this actually just happened to me in real life, which prompted this post).\n\nThe key magic is that one can create a single-line compound command by separating individual ex-mode commands with '|', and then using the resulting compound command on each of many lines via the ex-mode 'g' global command.\n\n(For the uninitiated: vi/vim grew out of a line-oriented non-screen-oriented editor called ex, and vim still has its complete set of ex editing commands in ex mode, that are unlike the usual vim commands. I don't have the time to do a regular expression intro, nor an \"intro to ex-mode for people who previously haven't noticed that it exists let alone that it is worth using\", does anyone have a pointer for people?)\n\nSo from here we'll assume the reader knows the basics of both regular expressions and of vim's ex-mode.\n\nAlso the bash shell is used in this particular example, although the technique does not generally require the shell. It does however indicate the vast potential of using external programs in combination with editing.\n\nLet's say our text looks like this:\n\n    A......Page 23\n    by John Smith\n    B......Page 73\n    by Jane Doe\n    C......Page 131\n    by Alice Grey\n\nAnd so on...but these are wrong -- they actually should start at 1, so each page number needs to have 22 subtracted.\n\nI had 52 such lines, so the prospect of doing 26 edits, each one error prone due to mental arithmetic, seemed do-able, don't get me wrong, but annoying enough to prompt me to use the ex-mode approach, since I'm used to using it.\n\nIn other cases I have been faced with tens of thousands of lines of edits vaguely like this, which would take taken literally days or more to do by hand, in which case some form of automation is absolutely necessary, and this ex-mode approach avoids the need for writing a small software script -- which itself would be a nuisance and error-prone and vastly less efficient in terms of my time than ex-mode.\n\nIndeed this approach can make the difference between deciding to do something with a few minutes of complicated editing, versus deciding that the task is just too difficult or time consuming to do at all.\n\nSo here goes, here's how to write an admittedly-unreadable but extremely effective ex-mode single compound command for that.\n\nFirst I vi-mode mark the end of the text (mA to mark it with A), then I use ex-mode global command \":.,'ag/..../\" where \":\" starts ex-mode, \".,'a\" is a range of lines from the cursor to mark A, \"g//\" is the global command, and \"...\" is the global command's regular expression to choose which lines to apply following commands to, skipping any other lines (the \"by ...\" lines in this example).\n\nWe want just the lines that start with a capital letter followed by some dots, so that regex is /\\^[A-Z]\\\\.\\\\.\\\\./ -- regexes are infamously unreadable but are second nature with enough practice.\n\nWe are going to transform each such line into a shell command to do arithmetic while retaining the non-numeric text in those lines. So each line transformed into a shell command will look like:\n\n    echo $(echo \"A......Page\" ; echo \"23 - 22\" | bc -l -q)\n\nThe bc command performs the arithmetic (-q is \"quiet\" and -l brings in the bc library and sets the decimal precision -- unnecessary in this case but I type it by habit and is needed if you want non-integer arithmetic).\n\nThat line is piped to the shell for execution via \".!bash\" -- \".\" is the current line, \"!\" is the vim command to pipe text to an external process, and \"bash\" of course is which external process to invoke.\n\nThe line is then constructed by using the \"s///\" substitute command,with one regex to pick out the first non-numeric part of the text and a second following regex to pick out the numeric part. The substitution text uses \\1 to refer to what was matched with the first regex, and similarly with \\2, so the first half of s/// is:\n\n    s/^\\(.*\\) \\([0-9]*\\)$/\n\nThe second half specifies the replacement text to form the echo command shown above to send to bash, so the whole substitute is\n\n    s/^\\(.*\\) \\([0-9]*\\)$/echo $(echo \\1; echo \\2 - 22 | bc -l -\nq)/\n\nThat uses | in the bash command for piping. In the final command we also use | as a command separator in order to add a command tell vim to pipe the newly-created command to bash.\n\nPutting all of this together creates the horrendous-seeming command:\n\n    :.,'ag/^[A-Z]\\.\\.\\./s/\\^\\(.*\\) \\([0-9]*\\)$/echo $(echo \\1; echo \\2 - 22 | bc -l -q)/|.!bash\n\nAnd voila, we are done, the resulting text is:\n\n    A......Page 1\n    by John Smith\n    B......Page 51\n    by Jane Doe\n    C......Page 109\n    by Alice Grey\n\n....and so on for 26 entries total.\n\nDespite the unaesthetic scare factor of its appearance, note that this is far, *far* easier to compose than it is to read. I almost never save such things for reuse, because it is typically easier to re-invent a new complex ex command than it is to copy-paste-edit an old one.\n\nI composed and debugged it in stages. First I did a simple global g// command, then I edited it (ex mode has history like the shell, accessible via arrow keys to scroll up and down through it).\n\nI started adding s/// substitute commands to that, so it took a few tries to get the regex right and to finalize the strategy.\n\nSomewhere in there I separately debugged the form of the shell command that would work best.\n\nTotal time elapsed probably 3 minutes.\n\nIn more complicated cases one might do a whole series of such compound ex-mode commands, to get the final edit done in stages.\n\nAside from the resemblance to line noise, it is also perhaps slightly boggling in its meta approach, of making commands out of multiple commands to create commands to send to multiple commands.\n\nNow that I'm used to this approach, I use it frequently, not rarely, and again, this was a simple example task, but often what is needed is on much larger blocks of text with much more complicated structure.\n\nA related common pattern is e.g. \"1,$g/.../-2join|join|s///\" to back up two lines from each regex-match, join 3 lines together, and edit the resulting line with a substitute command.\n\nUsing relative motion like that with g// is extremely powerful but not at all well-known.\n\nI'm sure someone will say \"that's ugly, I'd prefer to just do 26 manual edits\" -- which is fair, but again this is a simple example of something that is essential when the alternative is thousands of manual edits (or writing complicated scripts).\n\nAnd again, this is intended to motivate further exploration, not to be a tutorial.\n\nPeople often argue for the superiority of vim's interactive commands, but although I agree, I think that ex-mode is a widely unknown and *certainly* under-appreciated, but possibly even more compelling, reason to use vim, in conjunction with its interative commands.\n\nApologies for undoubted typos in the above.\n",

Nothing has been decided yet, but here are the current ideas being bounced around. \n\n- De-emphasis of stickies and sidebar, they are generally not seen / overlooked.\n- More focus on building out evergreen answers on the wiki (opening up wiki a bit maybe?).  I am concerned this will possibly end as pointless duplication and competition with http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/ -- what do you think?  The goal is to be able to quickly link to answers rather than having to rehash them. \n- Implementing a fairly firm no assholes rule.  This means banning people with a **pattern** of poor behavior, not for a one off bad comment / day.  This will **not** be backward looking but from implementation point forward, everyone will have a clean slate.  Disagreement isn't being an asshole, personal attacks are.  Sincere arguments focused on the tech will always been allowed.  \"I recommend instead of plugin $X you use feature $Y\" isn't being an asshole.  \"You are stupid because you use plugin $X instead of feature $Y\" is.  No more platform/language/gui shaming, etc. \n- Weekly DYK (Did You Know) -- to point out things Vim already does out of the box, and discussion around it. \n- Weekly Tip -- this can be a plugin, workflow or general tip and discussion around it. \n- Monthly Vimrc review thread -- obvious enough!\n- Bring on the bots -- the tips, DYK and Vimrc review thread will be automated by bots (pre-loaded) and various other tasks as well as can be will be automated.\n\n... looking for more ideas ... \n\nSome ideas from the community likely to be done as well!\n\n- Weekly Everything About ____  -- /u/sudo_bang_bang\n- New Theme and Banner -- /u/AGodWithNoName",
