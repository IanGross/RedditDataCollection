She originally would just stop playing content without being told, this just started happening and it was pretty consistent. Every five to ten minutes she would just stop and I would have to tell her to resume.  Then she started misunderstanding me. I would have to ask her things twice or three times.  Now, just a few days after the new hardware was announced she will not respond to her wake word. It takes 5-6 tries for he to respond.  She has become basically a paper weight because the frustration is not worth it.  \n\nHas anyone noticed escalating issues with their device recently?\n\nI mean, I planned on purchasing a couple of the new models anyway but the idea that I am being nudged to do it by an intentional degradation of the product annoys me.",

My wife is slow to change and will love voice activated lights, but needs time to adjust or she will HATE it.  \n\nIn my kitchen, I have a wall switch that controls 3 light fixtures.  One tube bulb over kitchen. Another does the chandelier over kitchen table. The third gets the lights over the family room.  Can't do smart bulbs due to number and type of lights.\n\nI'll admit my ignorance about products, features, and electrical concerns.  It still needs to have 3 easy to use switches that are also smart switches.  \n\nAny ideas?\n\nEDIT FOR CLARIFICATION:\nI have a wall plate in my kitchen with 3 switches that control 3 different lights.  Switch on left does living room light.  Middle switch does one over kitchen table.  Right does one over island in kitchen.  If is binary on or off for 3 light fixtures.  No dimming or anything funky.\n\n3 Gang Switch?  Turn 3 light fixtures on and off.",

We've scrapped the Sky box as it was more complex than it needed to be, and I tend to get calls when she goes to the wrong source on the TV.\n\nOn the other hand, she enjoys her iPad quite a bit (albeit in a fairly limited capacity, facetime, facebook, etc.).\n\nSo, my questions I guess are:\n\n1. How reliable is Alexa at understanding what it needs to do? My dot still seems to be a bit hit and miss.\n\n2. Are there any skills that you're aware of to sell this as a solution?",

Sometimes the command will be greeted with an \"okay\" and sometimes \"hrmm...I don't know how to do that.\"\n\nWould someone be able to enlighten me on what I might be missing?

Jotting down a quick note here as to hopefully help someone in the future.\n\nIt seems the Echo is really picky when it comes to connecting to WiFi networks that have multiple access points and \"overlapping\" SSID's on either 5/2.4GHz.\n\nTo help \"simplify\" things for the echo, I moved right next to my highest power WiFi AP and used static IP address settings.  This got it connected to the network and I am assuming that it was able to download a firmware update after which corrected any connection issues later. I have a _theory_ that it also does not like to resolve against OpenDNS which I use on my content filtered networks.\n\nOnce that it seemed that it had a connection to WiFi, setup then gave the 'cannot register device' error.  Since new devices are auto-registered before they ship from Amazon, you will have to manually deregister the device through the Alexa app. (Settings->[Device Name]->Deregister)  Once this is done, manually re-add the device through the Alexa app once again.\n\nWhile this may/may not also be an issue, connecting the device via alexa.amazon.com using my laptop was a no-go.  Its much easier to use the Andriod/iOS apps, btw.\n\nPersistence seems to be the key to this one.  One thing you also can do is attempt setup/registration through a dedicated WiFi network.  If you have a router that has settings for a Guest WiFi network, turn it on, connect and register, then move it back over to your dedicated WiFi networks.  (Don't forget to disable your guest network if you had to turn it on!)",

I\u2019ve checked the history of Bluetooth pairings in the Alexa app, only my iPhone ever has been, which was not connected and it wasn\u2019t any of my ringtones, app notifications etc. So no-one else\u2019s device. I checked the voice command history which showed nothing at those times. I\u2019m in the UK so it\u2019s not calling or notifications as they\u2019re not available yet, there\u2019s no lights flashing (like yellow) that would indicate those things as well. The only thing I can think of is a software update confirmation noise, but surely I wouldn\u2019t have 2 updates less than 4 hours apart. It happened a few weeks ago but I ignored it. \n\nAnyone have any ideas? Thanks!",

It lights up as if everything is fine but the speaker sounds like terrible feedback from an amp. I thought it was broken but right as I was going to send it in, it suddenly started working. I thought it was a fluke but then a few days later it was doing it again. I can adjust the volume of the screeches but the static won't go away.

            "selftext": "Hello guys,\nI've here an anoying problem. I've got an Amazon Echo Dot 2gen and a Logitech Harmony Hub. When I ask \"Echo, turn on TV\" the TV switch sometimes directly on, sometimes it takes 10, 20, 30 seconds delays... and I don't know why ?! When I ask \"Echo, turn on lights\", my Lifx bulbs switch on directly everytime. I've seen on logitech support to upgrade TCPWWWTimeout but I don't know if it's possible with my Netgear R7000 ? I've also seen on netgear support to set a DMZ with the harmony IP but no improve for me...\nThanks for help and excuse my poor english.\nJulien",

Somehow, globalisation seems to mean monolinguality, surely for the English speaking companies (though German, Spanish and French companies also have this expectation).

Are there cheaper options if I don't really need the Alexa assistant function.

For example at 10am I can create a recurring appointment that says \"Grandma take your medicine\" or at a specific calendar event like \"Grandma get ready for your hair appointment\" all without her having to know what to do and would just trigger and announce the appointment at the appropriate time.

Ideally you could still say something like \"Alexa turn your volume down\" to control it. So whereas before I could control two devices at once, now I can only control one or switch back to the Alexa by playing spotify/pandora or something, which isn't ideal when watching TV. \n\nI figured by now this issue would have been fixed, but I can't find anything from searching.

Several ways to do this:\na. Silence most common tasks\nb. Silence future identical requests\n\n!!!!!!OR!!!!!!  \n\nSilence silence ALL audio confirmation, UNLESS a confirmation command is given!!\n\nExample: \"Alexa, Play my Popular Playlist.\"\n          <<<<no audio confirmation>>>>>\n                    Music starts playing\n\n        \"Alexa, Confirm.

I'm stunned this still hasn't been introduced.\n\nOne thing that Sonos DOES do, is give the ability to set an alarm that plays your music service of choice. \n\nTHis all has me wondering about the next generation of speakers.\n\nWill the next gen Amazon Echo have the ability to play a music service as an alarm? (And will it be a software update to enable this functionality on 1st gen Echos?)\n\nWill the next gen Sonos add Alexa voice assistant capabilities, while still retaining its current alarm functionality? Or will one neuter the other?\n\nOr will Google Home come out of nowhere and beat them both to the punch?\n\nIn my opinion... the first voice-controlled speaker that enables music services for alarms will win. I will immediately buy 3-4 of them. I expect announcements to be made soon, in time for the Christmas holiday season.\n\n(I am aware of the bluetooth \"hack\" to make it work, but am not interested in making sure the rest of my family keeps their devices within range of their Echo so that their alarms work properly.

I set it up at home and one of the first commands I give it Alexa says the info that I asked for and midway it just cuts off with that speaker noise when it cuts out. Then 3 seconds later it restarts the whole thing. I first thought ok whatever i just got it and maybe that was a tiny error. Later in the night it happened again. I thought to myself ok maybe it'll stop tomorrow morning. Today I get back from School and I asked Alexa to play music from a radio station. She says playing (radio station name) then just off and does the exact same thing. When it comes back I immediately say the same thing again. The problem happens again. Then another time.

I have two bulbs set up in the Hue app, and I can control them properly.\n\nWhen I ask Alexa to discover devices, it tells me it found two devices, but they do not appear in my Alexa app, so I cannot group them into a single room. Using the names I gave them in the Hue app, I can turn them on and off individually.\n\n\nWhen I use the app to discover devices, it adds them to the app, but I cannot control them with my voice. I can also add them to a group called \"Office\" but Alexa says \"Sorry, I didn't find office\" when I ask to turn off the Office Lights, or any other syntax of that question that I can think of.\n\nAny ideas on what I can do? I've rebooted the Hue hub. I've rebooted the Echo dot. I've uninstalled and reinstalled the Alexa App. Nothing fixes it. It's like the Echo Dot and the app are not talking to each other. Both the Echo Dot and my phone are connected to the 2.4gHz wifi on the same router that the Hue bridge is connected to physically.\n\nI am not using the Hue Skill, but when I did, I had the same result.",

Contacted Amazon and they told me my alexa devices are all now on my Canadian account. Checked and sure enough on my .ca account all my alexa and other amazon devices (kindles) show up. Looks like you can no longer have devices split between different counties (e.g. some on .com some on .ca some on .co.uk). I haven't found a work around yet although I suppose the simplest would be to create a new .com account with a different e-mail address and deregister and then reregister the devices. At no point did I tell Amazon to consolidate my devices so they must just have done it because my .com and .ca accounts use the same e-mail address. As an aside another downside to this is you can no longer switch your kindle between countries - you have to switch all devices. If a book came out in the UK but not Canada, I would switch my kindle to my UK account to buy it and then switch back.",

I can turn the tv on and off using the app but when I ask Alexa, she says Television not supported. Additionally I can't get the RM device to learn any other buttons for the TV. When I press mute or channel up during the learning section in IHC, there is no response. \n\nAdditionally I got it to recognise my Aircon remote and it sends the IR command to the Aircon and I hear a beep but it does something else other than turning on. Comes on and goes off. \n\nSo technically I have two issues here. Most critical one at this stage is RM not recognising or learning from the remote(s) I use.

I watched some reviews on YouTube and people had said the Echo  Dot (Gen 2) is small and easily portable but has a low speaker. I also watched something for the Tap and said a problem is you Tap a button instead of saying Alexa which isn't a big problem with me and a decent portable machine.

Kids could listen to their Spotify and have alarms for school.\n\nSadly, hype is there, execution is lacking.\n\nFew things:\n\n1.  No Spotify.  I appreciate the website does not say it can stream  spotify, however, it does not say otherwise as well.  Given it is an 'Clock with Alexa' infers Alexa's capabilities.  \n\n\n2.  Alarms are a major PIA.  Setting up one for tomorrow, easy.  Setting up a reoccurring alarm....  you setup a single alarm first, then go into the Alexa App, change it to weekly (or whatever) then don't forget to cancel the original alarm you setup as a placeholder.\n\n\n3.  Setup was a pain.  Took a while to get on my wireless, had to put in my amazon credentials twice, required a reboot before a firmware update (it did not this in the app, but still).\n\n\nAll told, 20 minutes per device to get it up and running.\n\nNow, unless I decided to subscribe to Prime Unlimited (which I cannot, since I am in Canada) my three devices cannot play music at the same time, unless they choose TuneIn (which btw you cannot select genres).\n\nSo all told, it feels half baked at best.\n\nAlso, in the myvobot website to register, you cannot rename your Vobot.  They are VBOT-MACADDRESS.  Which is great until I need to know which one of the three I have.\n\nI would have been better served to get an Echo and the idevice echo alarm clock instead.\n\nThey do update firmware's often, so here's hoping some of the shortcomings, ESPECIALLY Spotify can be resolved in short order.\n\n..and if they can make Spotify playing part of the alarm function, I would be extremely happy.\n\nSo just be careful of what you are getting into",

I want them in Amazon Music so I can play them on my Echo. I have the Amazon unlimited music so I can post thousands of songs. I have already uploaded all of my iTunes music into Amazon so they're all ready to play.\n\nLet's say I have a playlist in iTunes that has 1000 songs. I want to recreate that exact playlist in Amazon Music, without using the dreadful Amazon Music interface to recreate the playlist.\n\nI tried using the Amazon Music PC app to create a playlist called Fun Stuff, and then I tried dragging the music from the iTunes Fun Stuff playlist into it. It shows the 1000+ icon when I drag it, but nothing happens, and Amazon Fun Stuff shows no songs after I drag it.\n\nI tried dragging songs out of iTunes into their own folder where it basically copies the MP3s into that folder, and then tried dragging them into the Amazon Music PC app hoping it'd work that way, but again, nothing happens.\n\nIs there any way to quickly create playlists on the Amazon Music App without having to use that god awful interface to rebuild them from scratch?

Got a new router, set it up but I never bothered to reconnect the Echo Dot to the internet (a fact it reminds me about whenever it thinks it hears \"Alexa\"). \n\nWell, today I was doing some work and I heard a tone come from the room the Echo is in followed by some noises. I went and looked and it sounded like faint broken up music or voices. Then it did another tone and the blue ring lit up. I said \"Alexa\" and it informed me it wasn't connected to the internet. I checked the app on my phone, the one device that the Echo was ever connected to, and it said it wasn't connected. \n\nAbout five minutes later, it did a tone/blue ring again and started making phone camera shutter click noises, then tone/blue ring.

Drop-in can be initiated from either Echo just fine, but when we use it, there's about a 2-second delay from saying something to when it comes out the other Echo. We know this, because we can hear it ambiently. Yes, that means we're close enough to shout, but I had hoped we could use the Echos so we didn't have to shout through the house any more. \n\nBoth of them are connected to my home wife, and are on the same network segment. Any ideas? Does what we say actually go through Amazon's servers, or are the Echos smart enough to realize they are both local to each other, and just exchange bytes with each other?",

He discussed the problem with others and came up with a solution. He changed my account settings and then emailed me what he did so others could also benefit as I explained that other Canadians were also affected. Here is the solution. Hope it works for everyone. \"Please visit amazon.ca/mycd Please select the settings option. Please change the country settings to United States by adding an address in United States. By doing this any digital purchases will be from Amazon.com.\" Up until yesterday, news flash worked great. After the rep made the above changes it is working once again.\nIf unsure, best to contact Amazon and use the above for talking points. I have everything working again as it should. Good luck.\"",

            "selftext": "First, I LOVE the new Multi-room feature ... I also love that I can \"control\" another device by calling it out by name now! That is one feature I wanted for a long time.\n\nBut...\n\nFirst issue, I've noticed that at times I can't keep all of my devices playing, sometimes they will drop off seconds after starting a song, sometimes they will pick back up on the next song, sometimes not.  Other times it will play for hours with no issues.  When having issues it seems to be persistent though, they will drop constantly during a period of time. I have checked my internet speeds, they look good, the wifi is strong, not sure what the issue is.\n\nSecond, If I issue a command to one of my devices it seems to break the music streaming.  For example, one time I sent a message to a friends echo and once that message was done the music did not resume.  Another time I told Alexa to add a song that was playing to my music library, she did so but then music was stopped. \n\nThird, I hope they can introduce a way to compensate for the delays that can be introduced through systems you may connect to the Dot.   There is a slight processing delay it seems through my Samsung Sound Bar, so this leaves my sound bar connected Dot just slightly out of sync with my Echo's ... If we could calibrate the whole sync thing to match for these delays that would be amazing.\n\nAnyone else seeing this issues? Any other problems?",

I was planning on ordering two TP Link smart plugs to start out, to control the living room lights and lights in the second bedroom.\n\nWhat I'd like to do is be able to say something like \"turn on all lights\" and have both plugs be activated, but also be able to say \"turn on [individual light]\" and activate each plug individually as well.\n\nWould this be possible with just base support, or would it require Yonomi/IFTTT? As an additional question, which devices are compatible with Yonomi/Stringify/IFTTT as far as smart plugs, devices and lights? I was thinking of also investing in a Smartthings hub for further possibilities, but would like hubless devices at least to start.",

            "selftext": "Hey you guys, so first and foremost, I'm french, currently living in Paris.\n\nSo two days ago, Alexa, on my Amazon Echo, stopped answering to any of my requests. Whatever I ask, the blue circle will light up, indicating that she is indeed listening to me. However, once I finished talking, the circle will never... well \"circle\", it will go straight to solid blue, and she will answer me something along the lines of \"*Sorry, something went wrong*\". What is curious here though, is that it looks like she does not process at all what I just said, rather she automatically tells me it failed. \n\nThe device itself is still connected to the WiFi, and is working fine, since I have been for example able to stream music through my Echo via the Spotify web app. \n\nBut here is where it gets even weirder: I have an Echo aswell as an Echo Dot, and they both behave exactly the same. I also have a few friends here in Paris who also have Echo / Echo Dots, and all of them are experiencing the same thing, and it started at the same time.\n\nI obviously tried everything, just to get that out of the way: I restarted it several times, did a factory reset, and even tried to connect it to a different WiFi network.\n\nI tried speaking to the Amazon support, and they were not able to tell me what was going on.\n\nSo here is the thing: **Do you think it is possible that Amazon somehow blocked Alexa in countries where it is not sold? Do any of you guys who live in France or other \"unsupported countries\" have experienced the same thing?**\n\nI honestly am not sure of what is going on, so any insight would be greatly appreciated :)\n\n**TL;DR: In Paris, France, all of the Echo devices I know have stopped answering to requests, at the same time. Alexa will say everytime that \"something went wrong\", but it is still possible to use the Echo to stream music, for example. Do any of you guys who live outside of the \"supported countries\" have been experiencing the same?**\n\nThank you very much for reading all of this, and as many non-native english speaker would conclude with: sorry for my english. :)\n\nEDIT: The TL;DR is now in bold.",
