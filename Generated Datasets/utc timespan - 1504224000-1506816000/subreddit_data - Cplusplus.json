My teacher is really sloppy and he just told us to find our own IDEs and compilers at home (It would have been nice if he told us to get the same one, so we could all help each other out).\n\nAnyway I strongly digress. I ended up getting Code::Blocks, a free IDE with the free GNU GCC compiler. This compiler doesn't know the SYSTEM(\"PAUSE\") command. Until now, I've just coded in a phony variable with Cin >>.. so that the program can \"wait for the input\".. while in reality I just want it to stop so the user can read the input. It looks something like this:\n\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main ()\n{\n...\ncout << \"Okay, now put a random number in. It will not affect any calculation\";\n\nint place_holder;\ncin >> place_holder;\n\nreturn 0;\n}\n\n\n\nBut as you can imagine.. that's kind of annoying and trivial and can even cause confusion. My question is, how can I find the equivalent? I've looked at a couple articles and forums online, but turned up nothing. The help section of the IDE didn't really help either.
