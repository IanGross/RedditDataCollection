Like a movie title. \n\nWhenever I input anything with spaces into my program, the program treats everything after each space as the next input to be received. For Example.\n\nSay I do:\n\ncout << \"What is your favorite car?\";\ncin >> Fav_car; // (Pretend I defined that variable earlier)\n\nCout << \"What is your favorite gaming console?\";\ncin>> Fav_console;\n\nIf the user were to input \"honda civic\", then it would only store 'honda' into that first variable but store 'civic' in the second variable.. because of the space in between. So How can I fix this? How can I force the program to take everything and put all input into the first variable?\n\nEDIT: Cout and cin aren't on the same line.. it's just reddit that forces that",

            "selftext": "Hi guys, just stuck on my programming assignment and need a little help. \n\nThe program requires you to open a file or a series of files. If the argument has no files, output is NO FILE. If the argument has a file that can't be found, output is FILE NOT FOUND. If the file is there, go through it, and get two things: output all the longest words in the file and display them in a single line separated by commas (IN A SORTED FASHION) and find the longest line in the file and display the length of the line as an integer. \n\nFor example, if the file \"example1\" has 2 longest words of length 4 and if the 3rd line is the longest line with the length of 16:\n\n> example1:\n\n> Fish, fish,\n\n> 16\n\nI understand how to play with if the program executed has no files or files that can't be found. I got how to get the longest line displaying it's int value. Open the file under the argument vector and use getline() to compare if it's longest. That was easy. I made some code to find the longest length of the word. Using istringstream and a while loop to loop through every single word in the file and see which word is the longest. I got it to display \"fish\" but I am unsure how to output both \"fish\" AND \"Fish\". Also, looping through the text file would make the output: \"fish, Fish,\" (since fish comes before Fish) instead of \"Fish, fish,\" so I have no idea how to sort it either. \nI was thinking of making an array and putting each word of the longest length into the array as start like so:\n\n            while (infile.get() != EOF)\n            {\n                for (int k = 1; getline(infile, eachLine); k++)\n                {\n                    istringstream mystring(eachLine);\n                    while (mystring >> newWord)\n                    {\n                        if (newWord.length() == longestWord.length())\n                        {\n                                array[k] = newWord;\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n\nBut clearly it's not working so any advice?",
