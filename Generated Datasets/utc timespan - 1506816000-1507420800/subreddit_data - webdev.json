Sometimes you also need 2x resolution images for retina displays. On top of this, images need to be compressed to reduce size but not too much to lose quality.\n\nFurthermore, these images should ideally be hosted on a CDN of sorts such as AWS s3 and cloud flare. \n\nThere are multiple ways all of the above can be done and the platform you build in (I.e. WordPress) may dictate your chosen method.\n\nSo have you built something custom to do this? Do you even bother with all the above? Do you use a third party service?

            "selftext": "So, i'm looking to try and start my journey in becoming a developer of some sort as a career. One of the many issues i'm having is determining the best way FOR ME to do so.\n\nA little about me: I'm 28 years old with no degree and i guess you could say very basic knowledge in Java only. The first time i decided i wanted to be a developer was when i was playing a private server of a pc game called Maplestory (i know... silly game). The game itself was coded in Java. I was playing a private server and the owner basically left me in charge with it. I basically dove in with no knowledge what-so-ever and tried to understand what exactly everything was. I examined the coding and messed around ALOT. Eventually i learned some basics and was able to create a pretty decent server. It was fun! To be able to think of something i wanted to happen, write it out, test it, then execute it and to see it actually worked. I fell in love with it. At that moment i realized what i wanted to do as a career. I attempted to go to college for computer programming and long story short i lacked motivation to complete the general courses required for the degree. Or just lacked motivation to go to school in general. Years and years later im here with a more motivated mindset and a goal to pursue the career ive always wanted.\n\nI've been looking into either going back to school for 4 years and trying to get a BA, coding bootcamps, or just self teaching. Obviously i respect the field of work and know how much time, effort and dedication it requires to become a good developer but, which option would be the most cost effective and efficient way to go about landing a job in that field? I read on other threads and posts how bootcamps are just a waste and how you might as well just self teach through free courses online. But if i took that route,  where would i even begin to start learning? I've been researching my options and i thought maybe i could get some advice from people that are actually in the line of work and their experience on the matter. \n\n(Sorry for the horrible format and thanks in advanced for giving your time into reading my post.)\n\nTL;DR: I want to have a career in software development but, i don't know where to start. With very basic knowledge in Java, should i enroll in coding bootcamps, invest money and 4 years in a BA in something like computer science or self teach?",

The website will be holding a directory of brands, products, and shops for my local area. \n\nI think I'll use Dreamweaver for the website itself as it's simple and easy for new users. When I looked at the back end part and asked some friends, they pointed me to ASP.net. However, apparently ASP.net doesn't work with dreamweaver. Is there an alternative for this then?\n\nI didn't do any research for the back end stuff because I might start with a static table that will hold the information in the beginning. Obviously, I'd rather go with the database from the start, but a static one just to get things going will still work. \n\nThank you in advance. \n\nIf you'll suggest me something, and I'll definitely appreciate this, please put it in as simple words as possible as I'm still trying to learn.

Even from localhost and with half the identifying information stripped away the api call worked - it kicked an error No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'null' is therefore not allowed access. - but it worked nonetheless. I researched every identifying part of the api link and the developer of the original extension and frankly I simply cannot figure out how this service is free. The extension is extremely barebones and doesn't require a login or anything, and I'm just scratching my head here. \n\nIt does appear to be a twilio api hosted on Amazon aws. \n\nSo what's the deal here? Is it legal to use this api for my little pet project? Can I make my little website and share/show it to friends using the existing api call? It obviously works which is strange enough but I'm just wondering about the rest of it. \n\nAny light any of you could shed on this situation would be much appreciated.. thanks!",

Just curious on your opinions on using unity as a development platform in this regard. This is coming from a Web Developer, while my friend is a die-hard unity guy :P",

            "selftext": "I'm building a public transit prediction app using the Boston MBTA RealTime API. \n\nThe API offers a route to get all the stops that are near a lat/long coordinate. This makes it easy to get all the stops that are within a short distance to the user. However, the JSON returned doesn't specify which routes serve that stop. To see which routes serve a stop, you have to make a separate call to the API specifying the stop ID. \n\nSo to illustrate the problem, where I live there are essentially 4 routes that serve the area, 71 bus inbound and outbound and 73 bus inbound and outbound. A call to the API returns 15 stops. The first 8 stops are for the 73 going in one direction or another and the second 7 are for the 71. It's not useful to know predictions for stops on the same route going the same direction. Ideally I'd be able to show the closest stop for each route. But I don't want to make 15 requests. \n\nI'm still pretty new to web development, so there may be an obvious solution. Right now I have narrowed it down to two possibilities:\n\n1) load the entire list of MBTA stops into the app when it first loads. Then when I get the stop information I'll have list to filter duplicates against. I can get this information from the API, as they have a route for all stops. \n\n2) is there a way to chain requests to a server so that I can get information for all 15 stops with one request?\n\nThanks for reading and any input is helpful.

In Rails, as you add models and controllers, the server includes them and one file can freely reference another as it pleases.\n\nBut in modern javascript frameworks, each file needs to import the files it depends on, and it can get to be quite a bit of text. Here's an [example](https://angular.io/tutorial/toh-pt6#register-for-http-services) in the official Angular tutorial.\n\nTo get everything working, a base-level module needs to import a bunch of components, and then creates a singleton object that imports/exports. It's like 30 lines that basically say \"use the files in my project.\"\n\nComponents themselves also make use of importing and exporting, though not quite as much as the base files, from what I understand of them.\n\nSo, this isn't the way that Rails works, but this seems to be a best practice that all of the leading JS frameworks have adopted.

            "selftext": "So I've been doing computer animation as a hobby for almost 12 years now so I have a lot of experience in design and creating digital art ect. About 2 years ago I wanted to learn programming so I started with python. And one of the first programs I wrote was a program to record how long I spent each programming session. \n\nIn total I have around 500+ hours of programming experience plus various udacity courses. Python, C, HTML & CSS, and SQL (my competencies are in that order) But most of my experience is in Python.\n\nMy situation is that I recently quit my job and moved to try and get into a computer science school, which only accepts around 1-2% of applicants. My reasoning was that even though I can teach myself, networking is really the biggest thing I'm lacking at this point given that I worked in an unrelated field and never went to college. Unfortunately, I just barely failed the entrance exams so basically I don't have a back up plan, because this school was the back up plan. I have enough money saved to last me at least 12 months so I should be okay for a little while. \n\nI've mostly been interested in computer vision, machine learning, and computer graphics related programming hence the reason why python is my go to language. But I've been interested in doing front-end just because I'm always inclined to work on things that have visual aspects. So I'm thinking that given my experience with computer graphics/design and programming, that front-end is the most realistic for landing a job at this point.\n\nSo my plan that I'm formulating is to basically spend at least 8 hours every day(including weekends) doing moocs for front-end development and create a couple fancy looking websites within 3 months as well as beef up my github and stackoverflow. And then basically start doing freelance work either completely on my and/or with some services like elance. \n\nMy goal is to either have a profitable freelance front-end business or be able to land a full-time job within 12 months. Although I'd slightly prefer freelance at this point in my life. \n\nHow realistic is this given my experience and my situation? Should I just \"get a job\" and try and get in a school for next year? Or should I follow my passions? Am I underestimating how hard it is to learn front-end development?",

This is because the JWT itself can contain an expiry time. Also, because I check the JWT is valid and untampered due to it being signed, I know that if it passes the validation it is a token I issue to whichever client.\n\nI figured this combination of using a JWT to transfer the user id and expiry time and then doing a check on the DB to see if that JWT had not been invalidated gives me the best of both worlds.\n\nAny suggestions or input would be welcome. I know this goes against most of what people have said about the whole \"this replaces sessions in the db look up entirely\" but I want to use it more as a guarantee of the person being the one I am talking with is the same person.\n\nIt also keeps my database a little bit smaller by having less fields.",

            "selftext": "Feel free to join me in ranting and arguing... this is the great thread of venting.\n\n1. Naive automatic adherence to best practices or fixes. Someone reads on a blog to put limit 1 at the end of a query so they do it every time without understanding why. Not understanding things is the biggest anti-pattern in programming. What you should actually do is tell the DB to limit 1 rather than fetching all the data, pulling it into PHP and then getting the first result. This is for cases where you want to find the top user or something like that. Where a query can only return one result, you don't limit 1. If you need to do that then you don't know what your query is doing or your database schema. You should and you should have a function to fetch one, zero or one rows which can throw an exception when it has more conveniently telling you something is wrong rather than sweeping errors under the rug. This is one example of many to highlight the problem. You have a hundred queries, one or two need limit 1 but they all have it. In programming I see hundreds of cases of these. The other case is where someone once needed to do something in one place to get something working after bruteforcing the solution, then rather than understanding just put it everywhere every time.\n2. Agile. The concepts are good, even necessary because you'll almost never get a full upfront spec, but again, naive application. People now use agile to build teams based on pretty pointless and arbitrary personality profiles. It's like these people aren't hiring for developers but for the cast of the Wizard of Oz. Good luck with that. Agile can also be abused keeping developers in the dark and unaware of the big picture. If you can plan ahead, do so, if you can do work in bulk, then do so. If you start breaking things up into tiny pieces, bouncing developers around and never letting them really create decent code then you're just disenfranchising them, probably making them unhappy, disgruntled and offended.\n3. OOP, SOLID, TDD, DDD, Strict Typing, Design Patterns. Give it arrest. Are we developing design patterns or software? Are we developing in PHP, a dynamic language fully metacode ready or Java 1.5? Use these things, but only when you have to and when you can (like typing, if you're sure it should be a string, type hint it, otherwise its dynamic, don't say no dynamic allowed FFS). Don't have fifty classes all the same except the types just so that it'll work in PHPStorm. In a dynamically **loosely typed** language fifty classes to cater to each type purely on account of it being a different type despite the operations being the same! It's a meta language, it wont work with static analysis fully if you use the language properly, you'll just have to suck it up. Your customers, your real customers just want things that work. They don't give a shit if it's insert acronym here. Start simple, just make working code, focus on the problem itself and not the solution. Premature optimisation includes premature design patterns, abstraction, etc.\n4. Frameworks. At least if you are going to use them, use them properly. Since the latest versions of PHP there's very little need for frameworks. Learning frameworks before PHP has to be the biggest anti-pattern ever. People don't even know why they are using them or what they are getting out of them, or not. Frameworks add millions of lines of code. They're frameworks however. If a framework is a million lines of code something is wrong. The framework is the least source of mass. It doesn't take long to implement routing, an MVC framework can be made in a day, I know because I tested hundreds of people with that task for recruitment screening. In all my experience, I've only seen a few very slim windows in which frameworks have paid for themselves. When PHP was a younger and more limited language they made more sense, today it's just YAGNI. If you're going to use a framework, use something simple. Also, why do you need a templating engine? You already have PHP. Unless you have some special need like transpiling don't bother. Another huge anti-pattern. Solving all the problems you don't and likely wont have.\n5. Turning PHP into *my favourite language* (tm). You can use what you learnt in other languages in PHP but PHP will never be those languages. Appreciate what PHP is and make the most out of what you've got. I am tired of people trying to full OOP and strictly type PHP.\n6. Ignoring performance. \"Why should I optimise this thing to run on one computer, when I should just not care because I can easily make it run on ten thousand computers if the need be using this newfangled scaling technology.\" We all know not to prematurely optimise but then there's also sloth. Be very wary of developers who talk about their prowess in scaling. Chances are they can't write optimal code and don't scale as and when is needed for the problem but instead to compensate for their own ineptitude. Be careful, be very very careful. I've seen people make things scalable because they've written things that have O(n^n) but could be O(n). They then have a dozen servers costing thousands in manhours a year as well as adding lots of cognative load and additional complexity for the scaling when I could optimise it to run on one instance in a dozen hours or so.\n7. Overusing a fancy IDE. If you need a mega IDE to be productive in your language of choice you fucked up. Chances are the average programmer with notepad will run circles around you because they don't give into slop, keep things simple, organised, minimal and never have code that is excessive. This is like copy and paste. It seems powerful, wow you just double the amount of code, but it's not good. We should always try to make good use of conveniences but don't get too used to them either! If you end up with code that can only be managed in megagui 44000.44.33.4 then you've probably screwed up. PHP is a metalanguage. You can accomplish everything you need with the most basic text editor.\n8. Buzzwords. Stop choosing technologies, methodologies and so on because of arbitrary reasons like because it'll look good on the CV or you feel it fits the job description. There's only one real job to be done and role even if your employer doesn't know it and that's to get things done in a way that best balances short term goals with long term goals. You know what's a buzzword? Me, in every place I worked because I just shut up, listened to the problem, got a solution out the door that matched it rather than focusing on my own personal problems like how people see me or job security. Look I got this working \"but does it use [insert latest tech fashion trend here]\", no, but does yours work \"no\" or better yet \"yes, but it's insecure, slow, unmaintainable, despite all the promises I was given by buzzwords X, Y and Z\".\n9. Bad timing.  A good developer in a series of races can lose everyone but then win the war. A bad developer will lose every race and not win the cup. Don't compete just to get things done faster. You're screwing yourself up and dragging others down with you. You're sacrificing the present for the future more and more until you have no future left. Cutting corners, edge cases, things that come back and bite you in the ass over and over until you're spending more time context switching than anything else. Just don't do it.\n10. Everything has to be new. No it doesn't. People make new things with old things all the time. Stick with what works unless you have a good reason not to. You want to take up tech X and be ahead but do you know what infant mortality is like? Chances are you wasted your time and you're not ahead, yet technology A is still plodding along. Use new things when you know it's good to and it really solves problems you have and understand. Otherwise stick with stable.",

            "selftext": "Here is the link to the project, **[stenella](https://github.com/cisco-ie/stenella)**.\n\n**What it does?**\n\nIf your company is using G Suite calendars, you run Stenella to subscribe to everyone or X calendars, and can create your own JavaScript code to perform logic based on the event.\n\nFor example, you could create your own triggers like, @music:<title> within the event title and update the event. What I've done as demo for fun is if @music is found, the app will search Spotify and append a link to the song link to the description of the event and turn event green on the calendar.\n \n\n**Background**\n\nSo initially I created this application as a prototype to integrate existing APIs with one of my customers and was my first project at my first job out of college. My team is small, so I've done majority of the work, but received a lot of guidance from my intelligent senior developer.\n\nHowever, I'm a huge advocate for open-source, and envisioned the project to be usable for more than just a customer. So I spent the last few months really pushing internally to have permission to open-source this project as well as abstracting the initial codebase. The real challenge came from interacting with different domains in a large company, especially as it's hard for people to trust a kid who just graduated college. Fortunately, I had the support of amazing managers and directors who fought for me. \n\n**Why I choose Node?**\n\nWhile in college I was a front-end developer, and JavaScript was my most familiar language, so Node made the most sense to me.\n\n\n**Technicals**\n\nWhen I first perceived this project I thought it was going to be a rather easy web-hook and response project. But instead, it required a bit more work as Google doesn't provide a payload to the notifications. Instead what you must do is create a \"channel\" to a event list, and you'll get notified of any type of activity done to the list. So the application will have to perform a pull against the list, in addition to manage it's current state with the list to prevent large request. Along with managing an offline state, the application has to handle renewals of channels, new users, and overlap notifications because of attendees.\n\nUnderneath it's also using rx.js, mongodb, express, and a few more wonderful libraries.\n\nIt's a far from perfect (lot's of messy code here and there, need to improve testing), and I'm still working on improving it's stability as I prepare to deploy on a working environment. I'm just hoping someone may find this helpful, even for reference :). Feel free to watch or star it to stay up to date on our progress.",

I know the first step is determining which domain is calling so that the proper data can be displayed but like I said, I just can't find any info on how this is achieved.  \n\n\nEDIT:  A simple sample experiment I want to do to get a grasp on things...     \n\nSo I'll have two domains pointing to one single website being hosted on my HostGator server. Using a database I want domain no.1 to display \"Hello World\"   and I want domain no.2 to display \"Hi World \".     This is a dumbed down version of how I understand multi- tenant web sites work.  Right?       I just haven't found much on how you actually detect the domain name.      ",

Since I started I learned some of what I believe are essential skills: SASS, React.js, some Angular.js, how to use GitHub...\n\nAll of that improving on the skills I already had about basic HTML, CSS, JS.\n\nI have also done some small projects that I then uploaded on GitHub to showcase to employers.\n\nDespite all this, I think it's not enough for the companies...

How would I go about registering a new route into the SPA after it\u2019s been built, minified and released?\n\nI can think of a way which would be to have a call to an API which dynamically injects JS into the router, but does anyone have a better idea?

We are using NodeJS with Express and Sequelize on Linux.\n\nI need to allow users to send files to a storage on the server, and organize them into directories that can also be created. The file must be registered in the database because I need to know who sended this file or this file and also because I have relations between files and a group and files and a log. Every communication with the server goes through an API.\n\nI have many problems with this :\n\n* Should I also register all directories in the database and use the relations for creating the storage structure ? It means that all files will be stored under the same directory, the directories will be \"virtual\".\n\n* How should the API addresses to access a file or a directory look like ? How should the response looks like ?\n\nWe have to create this service ourselves, we can't use Owncloud or something like this (but we can use any libraries).\n\nIt's my first post on Reddit, so I don't know if I'm making it right.

I'm still not at the point that I want to actually start doing this professionally, so this is all hearsay because I haven't actually tried. Originally, I knew about the various freelance sites, and figured I'd start there.  No problem it's low paying, I've got a day job. But over the months, I started to increasingly see that people have very low opinions of these sites, indicating that it's hard to get work, hard to get paid, hard to do the work (scope issues, requirements issues, etc.), and on top of all that the money is awful. Any time I saw someone saying this, it seemed to be paired with a suggestion of trying to get local businesses to pay you for a site. I thought that seemed a little unrealistic, at least for my area, so I talked to several of the devs that I work with and a few of them said they'd actually tried that to little or no effect, basically not a lot of response from local businesses, and really not very many local businesses to look at anyways. \n\nObviously this bothers me because it seems like both options are having largely negative results based on what I've been told.

My aim is to re-acclimate myself to Rails development and hopefully help new web devs who are stuck in the \"where do I start?\" phase.\n\nIn my previous post, I looked through my planning file and decided that the logical next feature to build was the voting system. This sort of feature isn't a typical CRUD resource, so this post will focus on creating a rough outline of how I should implement this feature.\n\n**Determine which actions a vote needs**\n\nAlthough votes will have their own model, their purpose is to act almost like a pseudo-attribute of links. They're not something meant to stand on their own nor are they intended to be content on the site. Their purpose is to give links a rank and, later on, to determine the karma of users. This means that they won't have all the typical CRUD actions.\n\nUsing reddit as the model for this demonstration, here's how I intend votes to be used:\n\n* Users can click a button to give a positive (\"up\") vote to a link\n* Users can click that same button to remove their positive vote from a link\n* Users can click a different button to give a negative (\"down\") vote to a link\n* Users can click that same button to remove their negative vote from a link\n* Users can click on the upvote button to add a positive vote to a link, then click on the downvote button to both remove their positive vote from and add a negative vote to the link\n* Users can click on the downvote button to add a negative vote to a link, then click on the upvote button to both remove their negative vote from and add a positive vote to the link\n\nReading through those actions, votes will only ever be created and deleted. There are no situations in which a vote will be edited or updated, so those actions won't be necessary to the feature. Deleting and switching votes isn't really possible without the votes being tied to users, though. For now, I need to focus on just adding new upvotes and downvotes to a link. Then, once I have user accounts, I can check whether a user has voted on a link to determine whether I need to add a vote, delete a vote, or change a vote.\n\n**Determine how to implement the actions**\n\nThe only attribute a vote needs to have \u2013 aside from belonging to a link \u2013 is the type of vote being cast. This could possibly be a boolean attribute, with upvotes being `true` and downvotes being `false`. Then I could count the votes of a link with the `true` attribute and subtract the votes of a link with the `false` attribute to get the rank of the link.\n\nSince the model for this application is reddit, though, I can't have a typical \"new X\" form for adding a vote to a link. To make voting more user-friendly, I want users to be able to simply click an upvote or downvote link to create a new vote of that type.\n\nWith that in mind, I think the best way to implement the create action would be to define routes that create upvote and downvote paths. Those paths could then be used in a `link_to` call with the `method: :post` option to create each vote type directly without the need for a submission form. These routes would call either an `upvote` or a `downvote` action in the votes controller, which creates the vote with the appropriate vote type (either a boolean, like mentioned above or perhaps a string of either `'up'` or `'down'`).\n\nThe upvote and downvote actions would then simply redirect to the root page, which isn't a good long-term solution but acceptable for the minimum requirements version of the application.\n\n**Summary and next steps**\n\nI need to create a vote model that belongs to links and has an attribute for setting the type of vote. This type could either be a boolean value \u2013 `true` for up and `false` for down \u2013 or a string \u2013 `'up'` or `'down'`. [1] At the moment, I'm leaning towards going with a boolean value since it leaves less room for error. If it were a string, someone could theoretically write code that creates a new link with the type 'loose' or 'turnip', which would throw off the up and down vote counts.\n\nI also need to define upvote and downvote routes that map to upvote and downvote actions in a votes controller. These actions will create a new vote of the appropriate type and redirect the user to the root path. I'll implement these actions in `link_to` calls with the `method:` set to `:post`.\n\nWith this rough plan of action in mind, my next step is to start writing tests to implement the voting system.\n\nIf you'd like to view the source code for the app, you can do so [here](https://github.com/bridge-ro/rankit). Bear in mind that changes in these posts may not have been pushed to the repository yet, depending on when you're reading this.\n\nThank you for reading.\n\n[1] This single vote model plan is different than the previous way I implemented the voting system of a similar reddit clone I made in the past. In that project, I created separate upvote and downvote models that inherited a shared set of methods from a `vote.rb` concern in Rails. This implementation meant that I had to query the database twice for calculating link ranks, so I'm hoping I can cut down on that by trying this single model strategy.\n\nLike I've said before, this demonstration isn't intended to be a tutorial. It's more like a documentation of me re-introducing myself to web development with Rails. It's possible that this is the wrong way to develop this feature and I don't want to hide my mistakes if this implementation doesn't work \u2013 one of my next posts may very well end with me reverting back to the start of this feature and trying again.\n\nAnd I don't think that would be a bad thing, really. In app development, you don't always know what will work. You may end up walking down a dead-end path, meaning you have to turn around and try a different road.\n\nI know from my own experience how disheartening it can be when I mess something up, let alone how overwhelming it feels when I don't know how to get things back to the way they were. So if this does happen, I hope I can use it as an opportunity to show other beginners how to recover from such mistakes without getting too discouraged.",

I am working my way (slowly) through Free Code Camp and I have built a random quote machine and a weather app, and uploaded them to my web site. The weather app has a user form that takes city, state and F or C and gets weather from the Yahoo weather API in JSON format, and returns a somewhat nicely formatted current weather and forecast. (Just to give you an idea where I'm at.)\n\nMy question is this: I have seen consistently bad behavior from Chrome, and *only* Chrome, when it comes to accessing my website's base URL. It refuses to redirect properly (as it is configured to do in cPanel). When I put in mysite.com, on every other browser I test with (Firefox, IE, Edge, and Safari on my phone - I know there are lots more but that's all I have atm) they all redirect correctly to www.mysite.com. But Chrome, for some reason, puts EXTRA www's in front like this: www.www.mysite.com. Even months later, after multiple Windows OS updates, Chrome updates, and I have tried using incognito window, I don't know how much clearer my cache could be. It's NOT a cached version on my machine - it can't be, it better not be, I mean, where is it hiding??? \n\nIf I put my apps in a subdirectory, Chrome redirects just fine; so, mysite/weather.com redirects to www.mysite/weather.com. The extra w's only happen with the base URL by itself. \n\nAnybody else see this behavior?\n\nOh and I didn't do the redirect config - my hosting company did it for me. iWF hosting.\n\n",

It has very little architecture to speak of, and needs to gain some organisation.\n\nWe can't just scrap it and rebuild it, but we want to add a little bit of sanity too it every time we touch it.\n\nI have a task to implement support for adding pages to the app (e.g. a simple contact page), but I have some time that I can actually start to implement a routing system of sorts.\n\nWe'd like to move the app towards a state that is somewhat sane. Ideally the end goal would be to be using a standard web framework (Angular, react whatever), but we're far off from there. Our thinking is that the first step is to slowly organise things into a saner state, then we'll be in a position to choose a framework and migrate.\n\nSo I'm looking for something that can be added in a small piece rather than bringing in a whole massive framework.",

I don't have any IT or web dev job experience or qualifications as things currently stand, but I have noticed when doing things on Codeacademy, it comes pretty easily to me and I do enjoy it. \n\nObviously I'd like to learn other languages too, but do you guys think that in the UK job market I'd be able to get an entry level job if I learnt these basic languages etc, despite my lack of experience? \n\nI could do an MSC conversion course but I'm not sure if it's really worth the investment if I could potentially get an entry level job without it. \n\nThanks in advance\n",

We want to implement a website that have various user levels. The highest in rank can create a template wherein he can place the details that will/can be fetched from the database. The highest in rank can search for a particular course and it's corresponding faculty in charge will be automatically be displayed (also from the database). Having known the faculty in charge that person will receive the template that is editable. That faculty in charge must send it back to the highest in rank after filling it up. We are planning the template to be an API of google sheets. (Is this possible to make google sheets into an excel file that will be sent to the gmail using gmail API?). Also we will try to add notification in the e-mail for the deadline of the requirement in the part of the faculty. If can do we plan to only use java only as our programming language. Unless python is essential. \n\nProgramming Background: \n\n\n\n- Proficient in HTML and CSS \n\n\n- Proficient in Java and XML (for android only)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBasically this is a year-long project for us (duo) and is this possible to finish within the time frame? Also pls do comment on what skills/pre-requisites we need to learn in order to accomplish our thesis.

            "selftext": "I've been spending the last few months working on re-building our public website from the ground up at work for WCAG 2.0 Level AA accessibility, and in the process I've come to learn that the overwhelming majority of web devs need to do better on this front (screen reader testing especially was an eye opener).\n\nI'm a big fan of automating testing as much as I can to catch the low hanging fruit.  [WebAIM's WAVE](http://wave.webaim.org/) tool is great for checking pages one by one (I recommend getting the [WAVE browser extension](http://wave.webaim.org/extension/) ), but that gets overwhelming pretty quick if you're trying to be thorough for anything but small, static sites or limited templates.\n\nSo I built a crawler to automate the whole process.  It was an interesting challenge building it in a way that would have reasonable performance and not kill my test server with too many requests, and it greatly simplified my accessibility testing workflow.\n\nIf it's something that could help your workflow, you can get it via npm, it's called [axe-crawler](https://github.com/tjscollins/axe-crawler).  It uses the axe-core library rather than WebAIM's tool, but they mostly cover the same issues.  Of course, it's not a complete solution (a lot of accessibility issues involve multimedia content or downloadable documents that it doesn't check), but it does a good job of catching and cataloging the low hanging fruit--and it produces a nice, fairly easy to read, html summary report.\n\ntl;dr: I build a [web crawler to automate accessibility testing](https://github.com/tjscollins/axe-crawler) with the axe-core testing library.

Some of the data has been somewhat useful, and I've been able to leverage it to remove some annoying segments of pages like a team slider with two dozen images or a google maps stripe.

It's a template, though, so I didn't exactly decide when to initialize everything. I'm confused as to what practical steps one can take to get around this issue.

I saw that one of the new standards that WebComponents are built from are HTML Imports.\n\nI got super excited when I realized this was a thing. I've always wanted an easy and native way to reuse chunks of HTML. Why should I have to duplicate that same chunk of HTML for my page's footer? Why do I need JavaScript to reuse it?\n\nHowever, when I actually got into HTML Imports they seemed so worthless I don't even know why they made a new standard for it. Here are some of the resources I consulted:\n\n* https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webcomponents/imports/\n\n* https://w3c.github.io/webcomponents/spec/imports/\n\n* https://www.webcomponents.org/community/articles/introduction-to-html-imports\n\nNow I'm only just getting into all this and I could easily be missing something, but is this really any different than how we might have done this before? Essentially it's a little bit of HTML code that you can inject into another using JavaScript. That barely strikes me as different, much less better.\n\nWhat benefit do HTML Imports add to web development?",

My aim is to re-acclimate myself to Rails development and hopefully help new web devs who are stuck in the \"where do I start?\" phase.\n\nIn the previous post, I finished coding the core feature of my reddit clone app \u2013 the link submission feature \u2013 and refactored the small amount of code I've written so far. This completed the first iteration of my feature build cycle, consisting of the following steps:\n\n1. Decide which feature to build\n2. Write tests\n3. Write code\n4. Validate\n5. Refactor\n6. Repeat\n\nIn this post, I'm going to return to the first part of that feature cycle and determine which feature I need to work on next.\n\n**Review the planning file**\n\nWhen I start a new feature cycle, I like to review my planning file to remind myself of the \"big picture\" for the application. The first thing I do is look at the features list, find the items I completed in the previous feature cycle, and mark them as completed. I don't have a consistent way of doing this yet; on some occasions, I've deleted the items from the feature list, on others I've added something like \"COMPLETED\" to the end of each item. For this demo app, I'd like to pick a way to do it for all app I make going forward. In retrospect, I think deleting the features from the list isn't a great idea. They're not there just to act as a to-do list but also as a form of documentation for the fully-featured app idea.\n\nFor the sake of readability, I think I'll do a modified version of the second method. I'll add the word \"COMPLETED\" to the beginning of the features I've finished so far:\n\n    * COMPLETED \u2013 Users can post links to websites with a short description of the site\n    * COMPLETED \u2013 Users can edit and delete their submitted links\n    * COMPLETED \u2013 Users can view and visit links submitted by all users\n    * Users can upvote links that they like\n    * Users can downvote links that they don't like\n    * Users can see the voting rank of submitted links\n    * Users can comment on links\n    * Users can edit and delete their comments\n    * Users can view comments from other users\n    * Users can gain or lose karma depending on the upvotes and downvotes of their submissions\n    * Users can visit user profiles\n    * Users can see the karma scores of other users on their profiles\n    * Users can edit and delete their accounts\n    * Users can see the top 3 submissions of other users on their profiles\n    * Links can be sorted\n    * Links will have a sorting algorithm for top-rated submissions that factors in a link's rank and age to ensure a good mix of top and new submissions on the front page\n\nPutting it at the beginning of each item makes it easier to visually identify the finished features.\n\n**Read the minimum requirements**\n\nAfter I've updated my features list, it's time to decide which feature I should work on next. I need to make this decision within the context of the app's minimum requirements. That description represents the initial usable version of the app, meaning that those features are the ones with top priority. When still in the \"pre-launch\" stage of building, I should never work on features that are not within the scope of the minimum requirements.\n\nHere are the minimum requirements of the app:\n\n> At launch, users should be able to create accounts, submit links, and vote them up or down. Users will have a karma score and links will be sorted simply by rank. Refer to the [reddit launch screenshot](https://i.redd.it/nsg5cj41wzmy.png).\n\nFrom that description, I can quickly extract the following five features:\n\n* User accounts\n* Link submission\n* Voting system\n* Rank sorting\n* Karma scores\n\nI've finished the link submission feature, so now I need to decide which of the four remaining features to work on.\n\n**Choose the next feature to build**\n\nWhen deciding the first feature of an app to build, I like to identify the core feature of the app. That feature is the base that the rest of the application will build upon, making it a natural starting place. Similarly, I pick the second feature to work on by identifying which feature I think depends the most on the core feature.\n\nIn this example, link submission is the core feature of the app. Users will be the ones who submit links but a link does not have to exist in order for a user to exist \u2013 users are not dependent on links. Karma scores are attributes of users that they earn based on the upvotes and downvotes of their submissions. This technically makes karma dependent on links but the calculation of a karma score requires the voting system to exist as well.\n\nThe voting system and rank sorting both require the link model in order to exist. Voting on links will eventually be something that only users can do but users are not as necessary to votes as the links are. Here's one way to think of it in the context of the features in action: voting is something that users *do* and votes are something that links *have*. [1] This means that votes more dependent on links than they are on users, which makes the voting system the logical next feature to build.\n\nTo recap, I have one core feature of the app: the ability to create links. Of the four remaining minimum requirements features, the voting system is the one that's most dependent on the link model \u2013 a vote absolutely cannot exist without a link. That dependency makes me think of votes as a sort of extension of links, forming a natural trail through the rest of the features:\n\n* Once links have votes, I can rank links based on their vote count\n* Once links can be ranked, I can add users to make sure only registered users can influence the ranks of submitted links\n* Once users are involved in creating links and voting on them, I can start to calculate their karma scores based on the votes that their content receives from other users\n\nAnd once I've reached the end of that trail, the app will have all of its minimum back-end requirements.\n\n**Next steps**\n\nI've decided that the next feature I need to build is the voting system. Votes don't work like a typical CRUD resource, so my next post will discuss how I should approach building this feature.\n\nIf you'd like to view the source code for the app, you can do so [here](https://github.com/bridge-ro/rankit). Bear in mind that changes in these posts may not have been pushed to the repository yet, depending on when you're reading this.\n\nThank you for reading.\n\n[1] In the code's actual data model relationships, votes will eventually be things that `belong_to` both users and links. The wording I used here is more to express the models as steps in a workflow rather than relationships between objects.",

            "selftext": "Hi there!\n\nI'm trying to setup Unit Tests with PHPUnit and TravisCI for a bunch of my plugins I've developed. Right now, everything is working quite allright! PHPUnit works on my local machine and whenever I create a pull request, Travis CI kicks in and runs the tests with a fresh WordPress install. So far, so good!  \n&nbsp;\n\n**But here's the problem:** some of my plugins are not standalone. They are built as extensions of other plugins, like WooCommerce. The problem I'm facing right now, is that I can't seem to properly activate/install plugins besides my own plugin. And if I have WooCommerce installed, it's a real _pain in the ass_ to configure it correctly.  \n&nbsp;\n\nSome people suggested to use WP-CLI to install other plugins, but unfortunately this doesn't work with the [test version of WordPress](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/automated-testing/). And I need the test version in order to run PHPUnit tests.  \n&nbsp;\n\nI have searched everywhere, read a lot of blogs, but it feels like I'm the only one encountering this 'problem'. Though I can't imagine nobody has ever encountered the same before.  \n&nbsp;\n\nBasically, I'm asking how you have setup your testing environments. I would love to hear your tips and tricks!   \nAlso, if there's some Testing Framework out there (for example to create a bunch of posts in the database), I would like to know that too.",

Any question beginning with *why would you?* or *why did you* will return a pretty sincere *I don't know* on my part\n\n\nStill no Javascript. I wanted to wrap this up before I lost my mind.

It came to a stage that for older projects that I want to upgrade or modify I am afraid to delete the line or parameter because I am scared that is placed there because it's a hack. Not to mention that files become unreadable exponentially as project moves along. For a moment it seems that for the time invested I could have written a python script that utilizes CLI tools and would be faster. Used gulp before, but switched from Webpack 2.0, yea I know I can use both but it becomes mess also. Tried everything. Don't get me wrong webpack is good hammer and PROPS to guys who contribute to the core project and loaders, but sometimes just wondering if the hammer is too heavy and can we as a community do something about it? Is it state of JS2017 and will it get better? Is it me or do you feel the same? What do you use for your development workflow? \n",

            "selftext": "I'm building a fairly comprehensive web based financial application, specific to a niche. The accounting side of it will be full-featured (journal entries, bank reconciliations, fee schedules, budgeting, etc.) and I've researched how to handle these calculations. The TL;DR is using floats or doubles [is a bad idea](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3730019/why-not-use-double-or-float-to-represent-currency) and I've landed on using [BigDecimal](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/math/BigDecimal.html) for all my calculations. This Java Class allows exceedingly precise calculations, because I can specify how many decimals of precision I want to keep and have full control of rounding rules, and what to do with infinite repeating values (like 1/3).\n\nI'm going with 10 decimal places, as a starting point. \n\nSo here's the question that I'm facing now: what do I show the user? \n\nFor example, if I wanted to calculate a fee schedule for nine people to share the cost of something, lets say we have this:\n\nFees of ---  $1,290\n\nShared between 9 people --- $1,290 / 9\n\nEach person pays: 143.3333333333\n\nIf the user in this situation is the one creating this fee schedule (the nine invoices), they should have the ability to go with the apps calculated value or manipulate the amounts manually. So what do present to the user? I have two options:\n\n* Option 1) they get to see the full precision with all 10 decimals\n* Option 2) I show them a \"rounded\" version with only two decimals\n\nMy concern with option 1 is that it's a *lot* of information -- possibly overkill. My problem with option 2 is that the user may be inadvertently loosing precision by entering manual numbers to only 2 decimal places. \n\nDoes that makes sense? Any thoughts? \n\n---\n\n**EDIT** I should say, this is mainly pertaining to `<input>` tags, where the user can actually input stuff. For general page display, I'll be showing a \"currency\" value (2 decimal)",

            "selftext": "This is the eighth post in my series on building a web application from start to finish, focusing on the development process I use when building personal projects. If you'd like to read the other seven parts, please see the links below:\n\n* [Introduction](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/71mmph/building_a_web_app_from_start_to_finish_part_1/)\n* [Planning a project](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/71mozr/building_a_web_app_from_start_to_finish_part_2/)\n* [Project setup](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/71tmce/building_a_web_app_from_start_to_finish_part_3/)\n* [Writing the first test](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/725srd/building_a_web_ap_from_start_to_finish_part_4/)\n* [Coding the first feature](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/72f72t/building_a_web_app_from_start_to_finish_part_5/)\n* [Create, edit, and delete](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/72n0yg/building_a_web_app_from_start_to_finish_part_6/)\n* [Validate the link model](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/72v0w1/building_a_web_app_from_start_to_finish_part_7/)\n\nThe app that I'm building for this demonstration is a run of the mill reddit/HN-style Rails application called \"[rankit](https://github.com/bridge-ro/rankit).\" As a disclaimer, this isn't intended to be a Rails tutorial. My aim is to re-acclimate myself to Rails development and hopefully help new web devs who are stuck in the \"where do I start?\" phase.\n\nIn the previous post, I validated the `Link` model to finish the link submission feature, at least for now. Whenever I finish a feature, I like to review my code and refactor it, if necessary, before moving on to the next feature. In this post, I'm going to look through the code I've written so far and see what I can clean up.\n\n**Create a git branch for refactoring**\n\nIn the past, I didn't create branches for refactoring. At the time, I figured that I wasn't changing functionality by refactoring, so branches weren't necessary. Now I think I was obviously wrong; I don't know whether a refactor may accidentally break something in the code, so creating a branch is important. If I do break something, I want to be able to revert to the master branch.\n\nI'm going to use branches for refactoring from now on, starting with this app:\n\n    git branch refactor_links\n    git checkout refactor_links\n    \n**Decide where to start reviewing/refactoring**\n\nPicking a place to start reviewing code usually depends on how far along in the app I am. Since I refactor at the end of each CRUD feature, I generally like to go through each part of the MVC pattern one at a time, followed by my specs. When I do this, I usually start with the model since it tends to require the least amount of refactoring. Then I review the controller, which is more likely to have a few things I can refactor that will usually stay in the one controller file. Then I check my view directory for the resource, where refactoring can be more complex since the duplication may be across multiple files (like shared forms, for example). I finish the refactoring process by reviewing my specs.\n\nThis early on in an app, though, I don't always go through things in that order with that level of detail. With only one resource so far, the amount of refactoring needed is usually pretty light. The types of things I'll be refactoring at this stage are usually the same across most CRUD apps, so I already have a good idea of what I need to refactor. Plus I haven't done a whole lot of coding in the app yet, so there's a good chance the things I need to refactor are still fresh in my mind.\n\nIn these situations, I would normally just go to the few things that I know need to be refactored and knock them out quickly so I can move to the next feature. Since this is a demonstration, however, I'm going to go through the more detailed process of checking through everything in the order I described before: my model, controller, views, and specs.\n\n**Refactor the link model**\n\nI start by opening my `link.rb` file and reviewing the code, what little there is so far:\n\n    class Link < ApplicationRecord\n      validates :description, :url, presence: true\n      validates :description, length: { maximum: 180 }\n      validates :url, format: /(\\A(http|https))(\\:\\/\\/)(.*\\.?)((\\.{1}.{2,})\\z)/\n    end\n  \nIn this situation, there doesn't seem to be a whole lot that I can do to make this code better. The only thing I can think of is to realign the validations \u2013 grouping the description validations in one group and the url validations in another \u2013 which will cut down one `validates` call:\n\n    class Link < ApplicationRecord\n      validates :description, presence: true, length: { maximum: 180 }\n      validates :url, presence: true, format: /(\\A(http|https))(\\:\\/\\/)(.*\\.?)((\\.{1}.{2,})\\z)/\n    end\n    \nIt's not a major change but it does tighten the code up a little bit. Whenever I refactor something, I also like to run my specs to make sure I didn't break anything. I didn't expect this refactor to mess anything up \u2013 and it didn't \u2013 but it's better to be safe than sorry:\n\n    Submitting a new link\n      adds the link to the database\n      redirects the user to the link index\n      displays the link in the list of submitted links\n\n    Deleting a link\n      deletes the link from the database\n      redirects the user to the link index\n      removes the link from the list of submitted links\n    \n    Editing a link\n      updates the link's attributes\n      redirects the user to the link index\n      displays the link's new details in the list of submitted links\n    \n    Viewing the links index\n      shows a list of submitted websites as links to those sites\n    \n    Link\n      with proper attributes\n        has a description\n        has a url\n      with improper attributes\n        is invalid if the description is over 180 characters\n        is invalid if the url is not a properly formatted HTTP/HTTPS url\n      without a description or url\n        is invalid\n    \n    Finished in 0.65945 seconds (files took 3.55 seconds to load)\n    15 examples, 0 failures\n    \nNote that I won't copy this output every time I run my specs other than this first time to illustrate that I run them after each refactor. For the rest of this post, you can safely assume that I'm running them at the end of each step.\n\n**Refactor the links controller**\n\nThe model was pretty easy, so now it's time to review the controller (`links_controller.rb`):\n\n    class LinksController < ApplicationController\n      def index\n        @links = Link.all\n      end\n    \n      def new\n        @link = Link.new\n      end\n    \n      def create\n        @link = Link.new(params.require(:link).permit(:description, :url))\n    \n        if @link.save\n          redirect_to root_url\n        else\n          render :new\n        end\n      end\n    \n      def edit\n        @link = Link.find(params[:id])\n      end\n    \n      def update\n        @link = Link.find(params[:id])\n    \n        if @link.update(params.require(:link).permit(:description, :url))\n          redirect_to root_url\n        else\n          render :edit\n        end\n      end\n\n      def destroy\n        @link = Link.find(params[:id])\n        @link.destroy\n        redirect_to root_url\n      end\n    end\n    \nThe refactoring needed here is much more obvious \u2013 there's pretty clear duplication that I need to fix. The first one that stands out to me is the params permission in the `create` and `update` actions:\n\n    params.require(:link).permit(:description, :url)\n    \nInstead of passing this directly to the actions, I can turn it into a private method and call it in the actions:\n\n    private\n    \n    def link_params\n      params.require(:link).permit(:description, :url)\n    end\n    \nNow the `create` and `update` methods look much cleaner:\n\n    def create\n      @link = Link.new(link_params)\n      # Rest of method omitted...\n    end\n    \n    def update\n      @link = Link.find(params[:id])\n    \n      if @link.update(link_params)\n      # Rest of method omitted...\n    end\n    \nThe second duplicated code is the `@link = Link.find(params[:id])`, which is being called in 3 different actions (edit, update, and delete). If I had a `show` action, there would be 4 calls to that same bit of code. Taking care of this duplication is pretty easy. First, like I did with `link_params`, I define a new private method to put the code in:\n\n    private\n    \n    def set_link\n      @link = Link.find(params[:id])\n    end\n    \nThen I can use a Rails helper method called `before_action`, which lets me choose a method to run before other actions in the controller. Using the `only` option, I can specifically choose which methods I want `set_link` to run in front of:\n\n    before_action :set_link, only: [:edit, :update, :destroy]\n    \nWith the `before_action` in place, I can cut the `Link.find` call out of the edit, update, and destroy actions:\n\n    def edit\n    end\n    \n    def update\n      if @link.update(link_params)\n        redirect_to root_url\n      else\n        render :edit\n      end\n    end\n    \n    def destroy\n      @link.destroy\n      redirect_to root_url\n    end\n    \nThat takes care of the duplication issues. My last refactor has to do more with personal preference. The `if` statements in the `create` and `update` actions are a little bulky looking to me. I want to switch them to a ternary operation, which looks much cleaner:\n\n    def create\n      @link = Link.new(link_params)\n      @link.save(link_params) ? redirect_to(root_url) : render(:new)\n    end\n    \n    def update\n      @link.update(link_params) ? redirect_to(root_url) : render(:edit)\n    end\n    \nMy refactored links controller looks like this:\n\n    class LinksController < ApplicationController\n      before_action :set_link, only: [:edit, :update, :destroy]\n\n      def index\n        @links = Link.all\n      end\n    \n      def new\n        @link = Link.new\n      end\n    \n      def create\n        @link = Link.new(link_params)\n        @link.save ? redirect_to(root_url) : render(:new)\n      end\n    \n      def edit\n      end\n    \n      def update\n        @link.update(link_params) ? redirect_to(root_url) : render(:edit)\n      end\n    \n      def destroy\n        @link.destroy\n        redirect_to root_url\n      end\n    \n      private\n    \n      def set_link\n        @link = Link.find(params[:id])\n      end\n    \n      def link_params\n        params.require(:link).permit(:description, :url)\n      end\n    end\n    \nAt this point I realize that I didn't commit to git, which I like to do after I finish refactoring a file. I take care of that now for both the model and the controller:\n\n    git commit -am \"Refactor link model and controller\"\n    \n**Refactor the link views**\n\nNow it's time to look through my view templates and see what I need to refactor. I like to start with the index page before moving through the other action templates one by one. Thankfully, there's nothing in the `index.html.erb` that needs to be refactored at this point:\n\n    <article>\n      <ul>\n        <% @links.each do |link| %>\n          <li>\n            <%= link_to link.description, link.url %>\n            <br>\n            <%= link_to 'Delete', link, method: :delete, data: { confirm: \"Are you sure you want to delete this link?\" } %>\n          </li>\n        <% end %>\n      </ul>\n    </article>\n    \nIt's ugly, yes, but the code itself is doing what it needs to do. I'll pretty things when I start styling the application.\n\nThat leaves the new and edit pages, which are practically identical. The only difference is the text of the submit button:\n\n    <%= form_for(@link) do |f| %>\n      <fieldset>\n        <p>\n          <%= f.label :description %>\n          <%= f.text_field :description, autofocus: true %>\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          <%= f.label :url %>\n          <%= f.text_field :url %>\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          <%= f.submit 'Submit Link' %>\n        </p>\n      </fieldset>\n    <% end %>\n    \nIn this situation, I want to create a form template that I can drop into the new and edit views. I can do this using a partial in Rails, which is easy to do. First, I create a new view file called `_form.html.erb` in the `views/links` directory and paste the form into it. Then I use an `if` statement to determine whether the form is for creating a new link or editing an existing link. If it's a new link, I want the button text to say 'Submit Link'. If it's an existing link, I want it to say 'Update Link':\n\n    <%= form_for(@link) do |f| %>\n      <fieldset>\n        <p>\n          <%= f.label :description %>\n          <%= f.text_field :description, autofocus: true %>\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          <%= f.label :url %>\n          <%= f.text_field :url %>\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          <% if @link.new_record? %>\n            <%= f.submit 'Submit Link' %>\n          <% else %>\n            <%= f.submit 'Update Link' %>\n          <% end %>\n        </p>\n      </fieldset>\n    <% end %>\n    \nNow I can delete the forms in the new and edit templates and replace them with a call to render the form partial:\n\n    <%= render 'form' %>\n    \nThose are the only views I have right now and all my specs still pass, so it's time for another commit:\n\n    git commit -am \"Refactor link views\"\n    \nThat finishes the refactoring for the MVC items, so now it's time to take a look through my specs.\n\n**Refactor the link specs**\n\nRefactoring specs tends to go pretty quick. As I add more features to an app, it becomes more and more likely that those features will break some of my specs. This is usually due to minor things like new attributes that are required for a model to be valid that I didn't include in the earlier specs. Since those issues arise when I run my new feature specs, I tend to fix them as they pop up.\n\nAs for duplication issues, the way I write my specs tends to avoid duplication from the get-go. So when I review my specs, I'm looking for any duplication I may have overlooked as well as places where my specs are either unclear or clunky looking.\n\nSince there's usually a higher number of individual files to review when refactoring specs, I generally just start at the top of the list in a spec directory and work my way down.\n\nDue to the amount of code in the specs, I'm not going to copy/paste the specs that I don't need to refactor in this post. I'll have a link to the GitHub repository at the end of this post if you want to take a look at them.\n\nReading through my feature specs, everything looks pretty clean right now. My link model spec, however, has something that's bugging me:\n\n    require 'rails_helper'\n    \n    RSpec.describe Link, type: :model do\n      context \"with proper attributes\" do\n        let!(:link) { Link.create(link_attributes) }\n    \n        it \"has a description\" do\n          link.valid?\n          expect(link.errors[:description].any?).to eq false\n        end\n    \n        it \"has a url\" do\n          link.valid?\n          expect(link.errors[:url].any?).to eq false\n        end\n      end\n    \n      context \"with improper attributes\" do\n        # Rest of code omitted...\n      end\n    \n      context \"without a description or url\" do\n        let!(:link) { Link.create(link_attributes(description: \"\", url: \"\")) }\n    \n        it \"is invalid\" do\n          link.valid?\n          expect(link.errors[:description].any?).to eq true\n          expect(link.errors[:url].any?).to eq true\n        end\n      end\n    end\n    \nThe first and the last context are what stick out to me. These two tests are basically the inverse of one another but the structure of the tests are noticeably different. In retrospect, it doesn't really make sense for the third context to be its own grouping. A link without a description or a url is a link with improper attributes, so it makes more sense to test those scenarios in the \"with improper attributes\" context. That makes the structure of the individual tests themselves \u2013 and the context groupings as a whole \u2013 more consistent. I also want to change the wording of the \"with proper attributes\" tests to match that of the tests in the \"with improper attributes\" context.\n\nWith these changes, the link model spec looks cleaner and reads more naturally:\n\n    require 'rails_helper'\n    \n    RSpec.describe Link, type: :model do\n      context \"with proper attributes\" do\n        let!(:link) { Link.create(link_attributes) }\n    \n        it \"is valid with a description of 180 characters or less\" do\n          link.valid?\n          expect(link.errors[:description].any?).to eq false\n        end\n    \n        it \"is valid with a properly formatted HTTP/HTTPS url\" do\n          link.valid?\n          expect(link.errors[:url].any?).to eq false\n        end\n      end\n    \n      context \"with improper attributes\" do\n        let!(:link) { Link.create(link_attributes(description: \"Snapchat's caption character limit is 80. Twitter's character limit is 140. An SMS text message limit is 160. Pinterest pins can have up to 500 characters. Instagram captions and comments can fetch 2,200 characters.\", url: \"Loose turnip dot government\" )) }\n        let!(:blank_link) { Link.create(link_attributes(description: \"\", url: \"\")) }\n    \n        it \"is invalid if the description is blank\" do\n          blank_link.valid?\n          expect(blank_link.errors[:description].any?).to eq true\n        end\n    \n        it \"is invalid if the description is over 180 characters\" do\n          link.valid?\n          expect(link.errors[:description].any?).to eq true\n        end\n    \n        it \"is invalid if the url is blank\" do\n          blank_link.valid?\n          expect(blank_link.errors[:description].any?).to eq true\n        end\n    \n        it \"is invalid if the url is not a properly formatted HTTP/HTTPS url\" do\n          link.valid?\n          expect(link.errors[:url].any?).to eq true\n        end\n      end\n    end\n    \nWhen running `rspec`:\n\n    Link\n      with proper attributes\n        is valid with a description of 180 characters or less\n        is valid with a properly formatted HTTP/HTTPS url\n      with improper attributes\n        is invalid if the description is blank\n        is invalid if the description is over 180 characters\n        is invalid if the url is blank\n        is invalid if the url is not a properly formatted HTTP/HTTPS url\n        \nEverything still passes, meaning I'm done with my refactoring. It's time to commit my changes, merge back to the master branch, and push to GitHub:\n\n    git commit -am \"Refactor link model specs\"\n    git checkout master\n    git merge refactor_links\n    git push -u origin master\n    \n**Refactoring vs. premature optimization**\n\nMost of what I refactored in this post are standard Rails practices that I would normally do when I first code the features. The main two examples of this are the `set_link` and `link_params` private methods in the links controller. For the sake of demonstrating the refactoring process, I didn't define these methods when I first set up the related actions in previous posts. In practice, I usually define them when I first need them since it takes so little extra time.\n\nThis may raise the question of whether this is premature optimization. As I've said before, I still consider myself a beginning web dev, so don't take my words here as expert opinion. For methods as small, simple, and quick as these \u2013 which are also pretty standard in Rails apps \u2013 it feels more like following Rails conventions than like premature optimization.\n\nFor things that would take longer to set up from the get-go, I'll tend to just do what needs to be done for it to work and refactor for improvements or removing duplication later.\n\n**Feature cycle overview**\n\nWith the refactoring completed, I've finished going through the cycle for adding a feature to an app. This seems like a good time to recap my process up to this point:\n\n* I start by completing my project planning template, which consists of writing an overview of the app, extracting all the features I'd like the fully finished app to have, writing out its data models and their relationships, and defining a minimum requirements version of the app \u2013 what some may call the \"launch version\" (or \"MVP\", if you prefer startup lingo).\n* I then read through my planning file and identify the core feature of the app; what's the one feature that I would consider the entire point of the app, the thing that it should do if absolutely nothing else? This is the first feature I need to build.\n* Once I've identified the core feature, I start building the CRUD actions of that feature in the following order: index, show, create, update, and destroy. I build each action by first writing tests that explain what I expect the user to do and how I expect the app to respond. Those tests help guide me in building each feature step-by-step.\n* When all of the CRUD actions are finished, I write validations for the model using the same test-first approach.\n* After I've validated the model, I review the code I've written and refactor where necessary. I do this by starting in the MVC pattern: I check the model, then the controller, and then the view templates. Once I've refactored those, I review my tests to see if there's anything I should clean up there as well.\n\nThose last three items form a feature building cycle that I repeat for every other feature in the app: identify the next feature to build, go through the CRUD actions test-first, validate, and refactor.\n\nIn my next post, I'm going to look at my planning file to determine which feature I should build next.\n\nIf you'd like to view the source code for the app, you can do so [here](https://github.com/bridge-ro/rankit). Bear in mind that changes in these posts may not have been pushed to the repository yet, depending on when you're reading this.\n\n**Series note**\n\nTo everyone who has been reading through these posts, thank you very much for following along. To those of you who shared your own stories with me, thank you for opening up. Your encouragement and own personal motivation makes me glad that I decided to write these posts. Truthfully, I backed out of the first couple of attempts I made when trying to start the series due to a fear of putting myself out there. Seeing that some people have found them useful tells me that I made the right decision.\n\nI'd also like to apologize for the gap between this post and the last one. I've had a busy couple of weeks at work lately, so I hope to catch up with this series now that things are calming down at the day job.\n\nThank you all for reading.",

It looks like Amazon offers email services, SendGrid has been particularly recommended, the company uses Microsoft. I'm not knowledgeable on any of them.\n\nReally just trying to accomplish the following:\n\n- Avoiding email being sent to spam if possible\n- SMTP of course\n- Ability to send JSON to an API where I can pass in such things as unique URLs, persons name etc.\n- Pass that JSON into a template to populate certain parts of the email (e.g., \"Hi { first_name }... \")\n\nRecommendations for a service? Since we already use Microsoft for our company email, I guess that would be preferable, but it seems like more service are more \"reputable\" than others with a higher chance that emails won't end up in spam.",

I set myself a goal to build a site with:\n1) A global nav bar\n2) Multi pal pages \n\nI did some digging around and found that PHP would be my best bet to create my header, nav bar and footer. I created 3 separate HTML files (header.html, nav.html and footer.html). \n\nInside my index.php file I linked all the php files using:\n<?php include(\"header.html\");?>\n\nGreat, it worked perfectly. Now if I want to make changes to any one of those 3 portions, I just have to modify it's corresponding HTML file. \n\nHere is where I'm running into a problem. I'm not sure how I should go about \"spacing\" the linked HTML files. What would be the best way to have the header at the top, navbar below it, and the footer right at the bottom of the page. \n\nAlso, I'm not sure if I'm doing this right, but I'm thinking of applying CSS styles to the actual header\\nav\\footer HTML files. I think that should work?\n\n  ",

So any recommendation from books or websites or video-lectures that helped you personally and have given you a proper and well structured insight into this would be very much valued.\n\nAlso, how much do you integrate that knowledge into your work? I am still at a point in which I am doing freelance projects on which I have to work everything out myself. But perhaps when you work for a team this responsibility is taken off you?

It has a hyperlink to add-plant.html\n- add-plant page has a form to add a new plant to this database.\n- the form submit button posts to /add-plant\n- srcServer.js (the Express server) receives this and calls controller.addPlant, passing along the data\n- the Controller (controller.js) receives this and calls model.addPlant\n- the Model (plants.js) receives this and calls db.addRecord (I realise this is an extra step but someone advised me to keep the repository/db connection in a separate file - is this necessary?)\n- repository.js adds the new plant/record to the db\n- the Controller redirects back to the index page, which then displays a table of plants with the one you just added at the bottom\n\nThis does all work as expected... I can click the add plant button, it takes me to the form to add a new plant, I enter the info and click submit and it gets added to the \"database\". But I'm not 100% sure if the flow is correct, and if it properly follows the MVC pattern.\n\nI'd also appreciate any advice regarding my directory structure/file naming etc... \n\nThanks in advance for any help you can give.",

I only found out today because during our lunch break the hiring manager told me that he had gotten over 400 resumes (he was not joking) this past week for a junior/mid-level position as a front-end website developer.\n\nHe had gotten over 40 applications from overseas and even had senior developers apply with over 10 years of experience. To be honest, I didn't really understand too much of the jargon he was using, but from what I understood, web developing is very popular right now.\n\nIt's very cool to see so many people interested in programming. I was even more shocked at the fact that people from overseas are willing to work at our company as a programmer. This is something that I could never have imagined.\n\nI even talked to a few developers working at our company and they seemed very cool and smart. They even showed me some of their work and it even got me interested in programming. Take note that I have never seen anything like this before in my life.\n\nAnyways, I hope I didn't break any rules with this post.

            "selftext": "Hi, my internet sucks and today I had a free day so I decided to make a bot that tweets everytime your internet connection goes down.\n\nIt may not be the best solution but at least is fun, by default, you have to set the Twitter API keys and your ISP name, set debug to false and you're good to go. It will tweet something like:\n\n**#Comcast's Internet just went down for 2 minutes and 39 seconds. From 21:05:31 to 21:08:10. It's the 10\u00ba time.**\n\nYou can of course tweak it or do anything you want with it. I tried to tidy up the code that initially was a mess, but it may contain errors or some inconsistent stuff so feel free to send a pull request or fork it or whatever.\n\nLink to repository:\n\nhttps://github.com/tyrellrummage/internet-downtime-twitter-bot\n\nAlso it's the first time a share a repository that is not a github page so comment if there's something wrong with the way I did it please!\n\nTo run it, go the the same directory (folder) where you have it and run `node app.js` (with the console).",

I see they have made things even more confusing.\n\nLet us assume, for the purpose of this post:\n\n- Either/both Google AdSense and Analytics policy require me to comply with EU cookie policy\n- I actually want to comply\n- My sites don't use cookies of their own for any purpose; only the Google snippets use them\n- I am able to incorporate e.g. Cookie Consent on my pages\n\nWhat am **I** supposed to do if the EU user opts out of cookies? (Or fails to opt in for countries with that law.)\n\nI don't see instructions from Google on how to tell their snippets, \"hey, this user opted out of cookies.\" Am I supposed to prevent their code from running if there is no cookie consent, in effect having no ads or analytics at all? Or is there a way to pass the \"psst, no cookies\" on to Google so they can provide a non-tracking ad/stats experience?\n\nI mean, really, it's not *my* site tracking anyone, it's Google's servers. But Google's language is *very* vague and unhelpful.\n\nFor a multi-choice answer, and assuming I have Cookie Consent or similar library working:\n\n1. My site needs to do nothing because they are CDN-fronted static sites with no domain cookies\n1. My site needs to notify the Google AdSense and/or Analytics code of the consent status with a function call, event trigger, etc. (please specify)\n1. My site needs to prevent the AdSense and Analytics code from executing in the first place if consent is required but not provided (if so, why doesn't Google provide examples of this?)\n\n(Snarky rhetorical question: how do you save negative consent for future visits if you can't use a cookie to do it?)",

            "selftext": "Hello and thank you for taking the time to read my story. I'll summarize and go straight to the point.\n\nI'll be 34 end November this year. Due to a heavy past (sex-addiction, depression, i closed myself completely out of society - no friends and rarely leaving my room), i've been unemployed for the last 8/9 years. Prior to do that, things were going normal, i travelled, 1.5 years in australia and worked in Turkey as a sales rep for a tour operator. I also worked in construction and in a callcenter.\n\nI moved out of my parents home at 31. In January 2016 when i met a clinical psyschologist that tried to shake up things for me, i finally decided to give myself a chance and started to be hopeful to land a job in webdevelopement. Somehow, i was very passionate about webdesign but started learning webdevelopment. I guess i was very confused back then to what to do and what to follow.\n\nI tried to become a self taught webdevelopper and that wasn't an easy task at all, i did a hugh chunk of freecodecamp & i was about to start an irl bootcamp of 6 month with an internship but unfortunately the bootcamp was cancelled and that led me to feel really down and i felt hopeless once again.\n\nBefore it got cancelled my anxiety went through the roof, i have severe anxiety and my addiction is always hurting me the most when things stress me out. Since 3 months now i try my best to get out, it was always accompanied with panic attacks and what not. But there is progress, panic attacks occur less often, i try to go out every day and i even started to learn in the library to get more accustomed to people once again. I know this sound surreal, but that's what happens when you de-attach yourself from the world we live in. Everything becomes scary.\n\nThis month, i might join (if i'm accepted) a hospital for day therapy, i enlisted myself because i just want to get over with this and give myself a last shot at life. (that sounds very desperate) but i'm really tired of this situation, i've suffered enough.\n\nRight now, i'm living on minimum wage, wellfare as they say in Europe. It's hell, i live in poverty but i'm still very grateful. I really want to get out of this situation.\n\nIf i can enroll at this center for my mental health (they propose day therapy 2/3x a week), i'll keep studying and practice my knowledge in webdevelopment on the side. Once that is done i plan to enroll for another bootcamp, it's gonna be PHP/CMS for the same amount of time.\n\nSo i'm worried, obviously, i wonder if people will still give me a chance with this gap on my resum\u00e9. Eventough the last year and a half has been very busy compared to the other ones, i've been learning most of the time when my depression and addiction wasn't taking over.\n\nI'm now 250+ days out of this addiction, my anxiety is going better, i feel progress, but it's a hell of a job to get back to real life and leave this illusion that i lived in for so long.\n\nThanks for reading, any advice, opinion, feedback on anything is welcome.",

            "selftext": "Backstory: I learned php, mysql, html, javascript, css in order to make a business app for my own business.  \n\nIteration 1 - Every \"view\" was essentially its own application.  There was no ajax.  It was just a php script with a search form and results in a table.  If you changed the search paramaters, it refereshed the entire page.  Data entry using basic php forms.  CSS included in a file.  \"functions.php\" included in a file.  The sql queries are hand written out in each script.  I had probably 150 different scripts, and I am still using this app, because it WORKS.  If I decided to change something, yes, I had to copy/paste it 150 times.  And that was laborious.  \n\nThe next logical progression probably would have been to make some kind of \"grid\" class where I could have said \"grid->data = $mySqlResults; $grid->render();\" or something along those lines so that I could start to update code in one place.  I had already updated it to have a header and footer so that I could start making those changes.  \n\nInstead, I decided I wanted to go full-blown modern JS with an API backend.  I didn't want to spend time iterating.  I figured out what the end game of those iterations would be, and just went for it.  Just so that pages wouldn't refresh.  \n\nI re-wrote my php to just be an api.  I made a mvvm setup so that I could make a new grid page by just changing a few lines of code in a new viewmodel.  The viemodel also informs the forms as well as the searches and I even got it to do graphs as well, all from one viewmodel.  The models work to inform uploaders, validators, all that fun stuff.  All from base classes so that I can, for instance, clean data before it is uploaded to the db.  SQL queries are automatically generated from code.  \n\nI tried writing all of the JS out but realized I was essentially re-inventing the wheel of a modern framework so I just chose one instead.  I put everything on github (private repos only).  I wrote all of my own components.  I got a digital ocean droplet instead of a shared server.  I'm using SSH and git pull instead of FTP.  I felt like I was finally leaving 1990 behind.  \n\nThe initial (non JS) version took me about 6 months to get up and running, and that's coming from no experience whatsoever.  I've spent a year now on these modern upgrades and feel like I'm still at square one.  Yes, now all of the code is \"in one place\" but I have even bigger problems.  \n\nThe problem I have now is that every time I fix something, something else breaks.  I just go in circles and never make progress.  I've fixed the same crap over and over again.  \n\nFurthermore, between different OS's and different versions of PHP, the same project when I push/pull on github, breaks.  I spend way too much time fixing stuff that shouldn't even be broken.  Right now I'm working on my autoloader for like the 10th time because it broke between versions of PHP and I've about had it.  \n\nA GET request is failing because it's looking for a file that doesn't exist in a path that's missing.  If I search my entire project directory that filename isn't even written anywhere.  It's somehow being generated.  But where?  In my router?  Autoloader?  Controller?  The ajax request?  The JS library responsbile for the AJAX?  I don't even know how to find the bug because the app is split into literally 30 different files just to load one page.  \n\nThis is all while trying to run a business.  I'm working like 90 hours a week for two years and feel like I'm going in reverse.  \n\nHow do I get out of this hell hole?  Does it ever end?\n\n</rant>\n",

My plan is after I teach them the basics of strings, ints, function calls, etc., to give them a small app that I make where they can modify/write tiny amounts of code (maybe 10 lines or less) that calls an (free) API which outputs really exciting and interesting outputs (of any form audio, video, etc.). This way with minimal code, they can get cool change and variety. That their small amount of code has a large impact.\n\nI have been perusing for a week or so now and have not found many APIs with what I imagine would have a lot of universal appeal. I have very few requirements (age appropriate obviously) in what I am looking for and am fishing for ideas that might spark inspiration. Also I think for an API to really have that universal non-technical wow-factor there needs to be more than just a text output. \n\nEDIT: One of my most promising I have found so far is https://www.filestack.com/features/image-transformations. So many cool things you can do to images (especially the image to ASCII conversion). With simple calls, they can apply filters (9th graders are obsessed with instagram, right?), rotate and other things they are used to doing on there phone all the time. Filestack doesn't seem to be free, so if someone knows of an API that offers similar functionality for free, that would be nice.",

It's a mixture of feeling like I'm not progressing, tasked with busy work, having to take classes that I do not care about, and slowly being filled with debt. My depression clearly stems from it, but I realize this is something I have to do to have the edge in the entry-level field. Also, other subs seems to talk about no degree basically being career suicide.\n\nI am experienced in Java, Python, C++, and C#. I understand algorithms and data structures in these languages. However, I have been leaning into web development and taking effort to learn it myself. I started with a Udemy Course and doing FreeCodeCamp exercises in between classes at campus.\n\nI am wondering what I would need to teach myself to be able to land a job by fall 2018. I know I sound completely ridiculous, but college is simultaneously making my mental health worse, and motivating me to learn more about programming.

            "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nAs the title says, I'm a Java developer by day (and [Rustacean](https://reddit.com/r/rust) by night). I'm held to certain standards: my code has to be clean, follow sane Java conventions, and be maintainable enough for the next person to be able to hack on it. It has to be well tested (both unit, and integration tests) with documentation. Whenever possible, it's supported by a Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery system (typically Jenkins).\n\nI was recently assigned to make a web application from scratch, based off of a prototype someone else made. Without getting too much into the proprietary details (it's company-specific), it appears to be a single-page application, but with lots of dynamic content. By \"dynamic content,\" I mean that there's a wide variety of menus that a user can click through, lots of options they can select, lots of fields they can fill out, and each different part has to update depending on what gets entered. Each menu and dialog has to be in sync with whatever the user currently has entered.\n\nI'm pretty good with plain old HTML and CSS, they're not too hard to screw up. It's the *everything else* related to web development that's making me a bit nervous.\n\nI want to make a rock-solid application that's consistent with the level of quality expected for my Java work. I want to write code that's maintainable, bug-free, tested, and clean. I want to be able to hand the reins off to any other developer and not have to spend weeks onboarding them to the project. I want to be able to use CI/CD to automatically test and deploy the application with each change I make. But there's a *huge* number of tools, frameworks, and libraries out there, and it seems like each year half of them undergo a major API change and the other half go out of style. I dabbled a bit with AngularJS a couple of years ago; I was unpleasantly surprised to learn that Angular is now a completely different product, and that no one really uses Angular 1.x.\n\nI know what tools to use for Java development. I'd love you guys' thoughts on the best JavaScript \"equivalents\". I'm really looking for stuff that's new and got neat features, but isn't going to just disappear overnight.\n\n* Which framework should I use? I was looking at [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) recently, and it seems pretty nice and beginner friendly, but I'm worried it'll just go out of style like Angular did, and then some poor shmuck'll have to support it years later.\n\n* Should I use TypeScript? Obviously, coming from a Java background, I like the idea of a typed language that compiles to regular JavaScript.\n\n* How on earth do I test my code? I can wrap my head around testing the logic-end of any JavaScript that I write, but how do I, say, test that when a user clicks a button, a modal appears like I expect? How do I test that, when a user inputs a series of values into several fields in the application, that the application returns the correct output?\n\n* What tool do I use to compile my code? If I'm going to be writing, say, TypeScript and SCSS, plus unit and integration tests, I'd like to be able to handle all that from a single tool, like I can with Apache Maven. Compliation is simply `mvn build` and testing is just `mvn test`.\n\nI'm sorry if these are stupid questions, I've tried to investigate on my own, but the sheer number of competing frameworks and tools all in various stages of adoption and deprecation makes me somewhat afraid of picking \"the wrong tools\" to make this application.\n\n**Edit:** Thanks for all the feedback, I really do appreciate it! Of course I have more investigation to do, but this gets me pointed in the right direction.\n",
