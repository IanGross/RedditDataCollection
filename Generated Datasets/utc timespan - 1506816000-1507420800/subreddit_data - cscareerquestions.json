I've never really had trouble with school (4.0 GPA, found all technical interviews easy), but there are huge swathes of this major that I just cannot stand doing, and they seem to be the aspects of the major that are most like the lucrative, common jobs people go for after graduation. I hated my classes on networks, AI, software engineering concepts, and mobile development, and I don't really like programming in general. I've never made a personal project and I still find the idea of a \"personal portfolio that I'm passionate about\" to absolutely alien and unrelatable. \n\nMy favorite classes were the ones that were completely abstract and removed from implementations and specific technologies - my classes on formal languages, data structures and algorithms, and all of my math courses stand out as things I really enjoyed. If someone would pay me to sit around and do proofs and integrals all day, I'd never be unhappy in my work. \n\nAs I look back on my co-op experience and my classes, it's starting to dawn on me that the things I like about computer science are virtually absent from the work I could expect to do at a company like my co-op. \n\nThe obvious answer seems to be to stay in school and go into academia in some role, but I don't know if I'm willing to put my life and my high-earning years on hold for as long as that would require. I'd also absolutely love to be a college professor, but that seems even more unrealistic without completing a PhD.\n\n**TL;DR** : Are there career paths that are high-paying, mostly theoretical, and possible without a PhD, or am I just going to have to pick 2 out of 3 on those?",

I've been a lurker on your sub for awhile as I wanted to broaden my knowledge and determine if going back to school for CS would be worthwhile for myself. \n\nHere's my background and current predicament. I'm 26, hold a business management bachelors degree (minor in marketing), and have 3-4 years of professional management experience in both project management and day to day operations management. I also have a year of sales experience, and do work at the University of Minnesota on medical device innovation projects (recently completed a 3 month PM role which was very successful). \n \nMy dad is a very successful agile software development consultant, and has made some great connections over the years. I've held off on asking him for any help finding a job, but recently I had a talk with him about how I was looking for a full time job for a year before I head back to school for my MBA, with hope that the company might see me as valuable enough to help fund my masters. \n \nWell he got back to me saying he had a talk with a higher up at a certain Minneapolis based company and I may have an interview for a junior PM job in software development or marketing (where I'd have no issues). Now, I have a very solid background when it comes to technology and computers and I learn fast. I've done some work to self-teach the basics of JAVA and web development, and it comes pretty naturally to me. What I'm wondering is if I should give it my all and dive in to learning to be a SCRUM master, hit a boot camp or two, and go for the PM job in software development, or if the consensus is that I'd be in over my head. Like I said I learn fast, however I always see PM's as much, much more valuable when they can do the technical work themselves as that adds a huge bonus in picking up the slack and understanding how to distribute work, what can reasonably be achieved in a set timeline, etc, and it would be 6-12 months working my ass off learning before I matched what a new software dev could do fresh out of school.\n\nAnyone have experience with this or input? \n\n(If there is a better sub for this question feel free to re-direct me as well!

Just show a presentation with my work?

Sometimes I think that its due to my chronic migraines and how over the years, they have negatively affected my brain.\n\nI work with two engineers one of them being a mathematician and they both work on developing a program. Keep in mind that I am not developing rather I am learning how to use the program so that I can teach others to use it. When he is explaining simple things as to how the program we are working with works, I simply cant register everything he talks about. Only bits and pieces are captured by my brain and then I have to play around with the program in order to capture what I was told and truly understand what I was told. This is incredibly frustrating because everyone else seems to get it except for me. In fact, theres an employee that just got hired and he has already surpassed me on understanding the program.\n\nKeep in mind that this is just me trying to visualize how a program works when interacting with it. This still has nothing to do with programming.\n\nSo imagine how much harder it is for me to learn how to code. I know what an array is, I know how a for loop works, I know all the basics. However, I have no idea how to start a program from scratch and then build it.

Your warm up question or helper method will end up being 2/3rds of the board, and all the interesting stuff will have to be written in a tiny corner.\n* Reach up to start writing above your head, instead of starting at eye level. You don't want to run out of space at the bottom and end up drawling lines everywhere.\n* Leave space between things. It should be possible to add a new line between any existing two lines. And leave a bit of space between \"sections\" of your code. You will likely have to go back and add things.\n* Don\u2019t name a method *isPalindrome*, name it *isPal*. You waste too much time spelling out words.\n* Don\u2019t name pointers *leftIndex* and *rightIndex*, this is an interview not real word code. Name them *l* and *r*.

Since then, I've been onsite with 3 companies, had phone interviews with a few more, and am still waiting on coding challenge results from a few such as Dropbox, Twitter--though I expect these companies will never get back.\n\nI've had a total of 7 onsites since last year (stopped recruiting for full-time in February until August). For the most part they go well, but the feedback I usually get goes something like this:\n\n\"The team really liked you and thought you would be a good fit for the company. They thought you had good problem solving skills but we are currently looking for someone with a little more experience and the team would not be able to provide the training you need at the time.\"\n\nI realize if I had completely aced my interviews this would not be an issue. So I know that I should keep studying and improving my interview skills. On the otherhand, I am not sure how I am supposed to round out my profile and whether or not I should take some time off from applying to do so. I currently have one onsite and a couple more leads, but I am thinking I need to change my strategy before I send out more applications.\n\nAlso, I am a May 2017 grad which seems to be--from my experience--disqualifying me from about half of the new grad positions. Would it be unethical to say I am a December 2017 grad instead?

            "selftext": "I'm currently working at my first development job, and I'm posting here because I feel like I'm losing my sanity a bit. Any advice or insight is appreciated, as I feel (perhaps naively) that what I'm dealing with is uniquely bad...\n\nI've invested a LOT of time into learning programming and computer science in general - doing courses on Coursera, Lynda etc and pursuing a degree in CompSci. I got a job at the start of summer as a programmer at a growing company. It's just me and my manager who are coding, and it's (ostensibly) an in-house ERP system we're creating.\n\nHowever, I'm drowning in what I feel is a horrific codebase. The ERP system is being developed in PHP -- a fact which my lecturer at university was shocked by and laughed at, expecting an answer like Java or C#. Personally, I like PHP, and I subscribed to Laracasts upon getting the job, and I feel like I've learned a hell of a lot about properly structured, OO PHP from that site, as well as things like TDD and Redis. I feel like developing a web app with OO PHP and a good framework like Laravel should be an enjoyable challenge. The project I'm on is the polar opposite of this. Hundreds of global variables, many with single-letter names, and complex spaghetti code with deeply, deeply nested loops and hundreds of if-else conditions one after the other. No semblence of structure at all, no separation of concerns. It's often difficult to find where global variables originate from, as they're passed down a line of 'include' statements.\n\nAny classes are full of public properties anyway, and there's an important class called 'do'. Every file is a mess, with SQL, PHP, Javascript and HTML interspersed within the one file. There is absolutely zero documentation, no tests at all, and absolutely no error handling apart from any code I've written. Also, no version control.\n\nEvery form is also being created, not in raw HTML, but by storing all the data needed to create the forms in a database table, and automating the creation of forms by pulling the relevant data out of the database and using that to create the HTML. I don't fully know how to explain this, but basically everything (input/button type, class, id,  placeholders, etc) is stored in a database table, and for EVERY form on the system, the data is pulled from the database instead of just simply creating the form. This means every form is tightly coupled to the code that automates the creation of the form. It is a nightmare of complexity, because anytime you need to make a simple change to the form, you need to dive into the database, find the rows corresponding to the form ID, and change the relevant data in the database.\n\nEVERY form is also processed by a single function which is about 300 lines long - in other words, EVERY form that gets submitted is processed in one place. No form-specific error handling or logic checking can take place. There's also no database abstraction whatsoever, the SQL is just fired into PHP files and processed amongst the PHP, HTML and JS. The manager also has a propensity to put data into multi-dimensional arrays and try and process it all in one place using deeply nested loops. My attempts to change one such instance of this to OO code, with classes representing business objects with a public interface of methods you can call to get the data you need, were scrapped in favour of a single-file, thousand line, 100+ variable monster in which all the data is processed in one place in a mess of spaghetti code.\n\nI wanted desperately to learn in this current job, and initially saw it as a great opportunity. However, I'm utterly convinced that this project will fail. Nothing works, and there seems to be no accountability in the company for this whatsoever. I spend a lot of time waiting for the manager to \"fix\" errors, but I'm also unable to make changes because everything else breaks. I try to learn other things, and I've spent a lot of time messing with an unused Ubuntu server in the office, but overall I really feel like I'm stagnating. My manager is abrasive, and does not seem interested in changing his methods.\n\nHowever, I'm still at university, and I enjoy the money the job provides (although I also have savings). I will certainly be handing my notice in after new year if nothing changes, but one question I'd like to ask is: should I mention this situation in future interviews? Should I provide samples of the code I'm dealing with? Should I show recruiters this very post?\n\nAny advice is appreciated. I continue to watch Laracasts videos, read books, keep up with university, and work on my own projects, but I feel like I could be learning so much more if I was in a job with proper mentoring from senior devs. That's another frustrating thing...\n\nCheers",

            "selftext": "#TLDR\nI want to become a professional software developer for a company with a good culture that is interested in solving meaningful and interesting problems. I'm not a complete beginner, nor am I an expert. I am reaching out here because I feel lost, unsure of a good strategy to get to my goal.\n#Where I am now\nMy background is in liberal arts, but after a couple years in the working world, I've found a dissatisfying amount of money and intrinsic reward. Then I started looking for something else that could be enjoyable and profitable, and landed on programming. I started working on little games and reading programming books and tutorials and continued to enjoy it, enough to feel good about committing to going back to school to study it. I'm half way through my first semester as a CS student and wish I could code and learn as my primary occupation, but I have two part-time jobs and am taking a math class in addition to Java.\n\nI feel disoriented, with a vague idea of where I want to go, and no confidence on how to get there. I've practiced Java a lot, interviewed people in different areas of the industry, read some books, read a lot of websites, listened to podcasts, done many online free exercises, made a personal website, started looking into contributing to open source projects. I wish I had a mentor to keep me on a good path, to help me recognize the golden opportunities, the wastes of time.\n\n#Boot camp?\nThat's why I am considering going to a coding boot camp in January, but am conflicted. All the ones I've researched only offer various flavors of web / mobile development. I am afraid that if I go to a boot camp, I'd mostly only be eligible for jobs making imitations of popular websites and apps that cater to the lowest common denominators and prey on human weakness to extract money from people while not improving their lives in any meaningful way, perhaps even encouraging unhealthy behavior.\n\n#Specialize?\nI am not sure what area of CS would best suit my abilities and interests, but I think I'd like something like building tools for a company to automate or increase efficiency internally, or implementing new technologies and create new possibilities. Some areas that attract me are: space travel / exploration, robotics, prosthetics, artificial intelligence, transportation, renewable energy, humanitarian relief, education, human development, mental health, coffee, music, running, biking\nWould a boot camp not be the best path to a job along these lines? If not, what would be better? A traditional CS degree? Keep self-teaching? An internship? An entry level developer job now? I appreciate any feedback.\n\n",

I'm wondering how worthwhile it is to pick a project that is somewhat original, or at the very least *different* from the typical generic projects that students will do.\n\nOf course, I can't claim my projects are entirely original, but they are at least niche enough to not be listed 100 different places on the internet as sample projects (like some blog or calendar app).  They may fall under the subset of a common project (like game AI, live web app), but they are still specific enough to require original coding work.\n\nIt would be so easy to make something mundane like a calculator app, but to me that seems entirely pointless.  Are people actually having success with this uninspired easy stuff?  Is it even worth putting in the extra work to do something specific to your interests?\n\nSurely your average calculator app can be a simple copy-paste job for anyone with the ability to use a search engine.  If employers only care about you HAVING a project, just like they often only care about you HAVING a degree, then am I just wasting a colossal amount of time by working on this shit?\n\nDon't get me wrong, I like my projects, they refer to specific interests of mine, but it annoys me that some jackass who made a calculator and a todo list may be having more success than me.  Not unlike it angers me deeply when people cheat their way through school and end up with the same degree and GPA I have (if I ever chose to be a serial killer, lets say I know who I want to target!).\n\nAnyway, just wondering what you guys think.  Perhaps it doesn't even matter at all because nobody even cares about project.  Hah!  How funny that would be.  I guess we're all just running in hamster wheels.",

Now I strongly believe security is becoming more and more of an interdisciplinary area, very soon security engineers will also have to learn DevOps skills(and vice versa), so I will not have to give up software(I can pursue it on the side as well.) \n\nSwitch to what - I am looking for a security solution architect role and advise on how to get there and in how many years. I do not want to be on the incident response team(while I am keen on identifying and fixing a breach, but on-call 24/7 is not for me. Neither is more than 20% travel.)\nMy interests are more towards designing a security solution and integrating it with SDN/network management software to automate when possible after due analysis of data. I am interested in vulnerability and penetration testing of network and software,  but not an IT operations role where I would just need to run pre-existing tools and report results.\nIs such a role possible or am I just cherry picking job functions?

            "selftext": "Dear r/cscareerquestions, \n\nI have a situation, which I think I partially figured out what to do, but need your inputs. Can you help me?\n\n**Background**\n\nI'm a chemical engineer, a few years of exp. I get compensated in the 90-95k range (not including bonus). I'm currently living in Houston and desire to move to Austin (or other exciting cities) along with transition to software engineering. \n\n**Why software engineering**\n\nThe market in Oil and Gas in Houston has been slowed. Additionally, I felt like the industry and the experience does not excite me as much. There was little room to grow at my current company. Overall, I want something new in the city I have always wanted to live in. \n\nSoftware engineering offers me some exciting opportunities (in no particular order):\n\n1. The culture. The perk of working a more exciting environment (startup), free lunches and flexible work schedule (sounds enticing even though I know it's not that big of a deal). I work in oil and gas and the culture overall reluctant to change or learning and improving. The work locations are often tough and remote for chemical engineering. \n2. The demand to constantly grow and learn. One can say \"you can do the same in chemical engineering\" but I somehow has lost the interest in chemical engineering. I also love to learn on my side software projects (which I recognize is going to be a lot less fun as \"a job\"). \n3. The pay is comparable (admittedly there will be a \"transition cost\" to a new career and I'm unclear how expensive that might be). \n4. To live where I wanted to live (Austin). Huge factor actually. \n\n**Options**\n\nI have set on attending a bootcamp and my current company (not a software focused company) asked me to stay with a promise of \"we have some project that requires software development (Full Stack) that you can start to learn on\". They offered two options: \n\n1. they pay for some for the bootcamp and I return to work for them afterward, in Austin OR \n2. stay on board for a few months more, skip the bootcamp, and they'll move me to Austin to work on that project. \n\n**Some of my concerns**\n\n0. **If I never try the Hack Reactor, I would never know what's out there and how much I can achieve**\n1. this project is \"overpromised\" to be something that's not that involved and I won't be doing as much software engineering as \"some pseudo software development exp\". The project can also be short live. \n2. Knowing my company, they will ask me to take a pay cut (not sure how much, I'm assuming here). I can reasonably take 10%-15%\n3. I will not learn as much as I would compared to be being with the big company. Not attending the bootcamp also mean I lack the structured study needed (and will need to learn on my own). \n\nI am grateful that they did offer at all. However, not knowing what's this project is going to be, I'm torn about attending the bootcamp or whether to take up the offer at all. **What would be some good questions, crucial pieces of information I should find out to make the smartest decision?** Better yet, should I just pick one without questions?\n\nThanks guys.

I was pleasantly surprised at first but now I'm getting in my own head.\n\nI presented the naive solution, a better solution, and the optimal solution as the constraints of the problem were adjusted by my interviewer. Did a lot of description on time and space complexity as the constraints were adjusted as well. I think I performed well and was definitely never \"stumped.\" But I'm worried that if I ever stumbled or was ever \"too slow\" that it would be doubly detrimental against me because the question was on the easy end.\n\nThoughts?\n\nThanks.",

I received a good offer to work in a huge tech company, which made me leave my life behind and emigrate (this is part of the problem, as I had to make irreversible changes to my life for this *awesome* job.). \n\nThe company I joined has been in the market for about 30 years and it is specialized in a specific market which it dominates completely. It is the *google* of this field. *Bing* dominates the market across the ocean, but Europe is dominated by this company.  \n\nThe interview was extremely interesting and challenging, which made me (wrongly) extrapolate that the job would be awesome. \n\n# What I was told\n\nI was told I would be working on a super interesting problem, in a fast-paced environment. My job description specifically includes development and although refactoring/maintenance is necessary, I would strongly prefer to spend most of my time solving new problems. I was told I would be working with C++. \n\n# What I got\n\n## The good\n\n* The working hours are super relaxed (as in, if you choose to get to the office at 5pm everyday and leave at 1am then you totally can and you don't even need to ask for permission).\n\n* The office itself is quite nice. \n\n* The salary is almost *twice as much* as I'd be making somewhere else. \n\n## The bad\n\n* I am working with extremely buggy, undocumented, legacy code. I have not seen a single unit test. Only *blackbox testing* is done by shooting input values across the whole thing (not through a specific function or module, the whole thing) and *diff'ing* log files. It is common to see functions taking 30 parameters. I was told that the main, super optimized, algorithm takes 90+. Lots of substring handling everywhere and duplicated code. \n\n* I feel like my skills are not getting any better. 100% of my work so far has been something like finding out what the (undocumented) global variable `txdArbsRek` (fake name) is supposed to mean, and why sometimes it overflows. Or if it overflows at all. Maybe the problem comes from somewhere else. No one really knows because... there isn't a single unit test. \n\n* I am not using C++ at all. I am using C with a C++ compiler. I haven't seen one single use of the standard library. I know C, but I still feel like I was fooled. \n\n* Management recently implemented *scrum* and it is implemented very poorly. The *scrum teams* are composed of people who are actually not in the same development team, so the meetings are extremely awkward and not very productive. Most people just skip them and that is somehow okay. My scrum meetings have 3 people + scrum master. \n\n* It looks to me like 50% of the development work in my department is done by two rockstars who are total experts (they truly are, and I respect them immensely) and the rest of us mortals are left with refactoring and debugging 30 year old code. The department has around 80 devs, to be conservative.\n\n* During lunch breaks, 90% of the conversations of my co-workers are about leaving the company and the other 10% are about the poor quality of the code we are working with. Most people are either interviewing or just stay because of the golden handcuff. \n\nI really don't know where to go from here. I feel drained and lost. I think I am not depressed (I have never been there before), but I'm afraid that will come with time. \n\nIf I leave the company now, I have to emigrate again since this is really the only company in the area taking english speakers (I don't speak the native language. Working on it though.).\n\nI could go back to my home country and land a job instantly, but the conditions there are not attractive at all. Emigration did irreversible damage to my personal life, and going back to my home country after a few months would feel worse than anything else I could do now.\n\nAnd leaving a job after a couple of months would not look very good in my CV, would it? \n\nAdvice needed, really.

To be blunt, I am having a miserable time. I thought I would enjoy the additional challenge and opportunity to learn more about a field i think is interesting, in addition to getting to do more research. However, I have been having second thoughts given the expectations of working 24/7 (or rather, this is the only way to keep up), complete lack of social interaction (grad students don't seem to care as much, many international students), and truthfully the feeling that research becomes just as monotonous as some of the engineering work I was trying to avoid, just much harder. I am guaranteed funding for at least 4 years (this year being a fellowship which is quite nice) and have the possibility of obtaining a master's in 2-2.5 years on the way to a PhD. \n\n\nCurrently, my plan is to try to survive until I get my master's and then leave, but I was curious about whether even that is worth it. It seems like a \"free\" (not including potential income loss) master's is worth it, especially when my field of interest in Machine Learning which is quite math/theory based (unless you're just plugging into black boxe frameworks which is probably pretty common) but maybe in CS it really doesn't matter if you have relevant projects (or publications.)\n\n\nFor some background into how i got into this mess, I am 22 and graduated with a BS in CSE summa cum laude this past Spring with, as far as research goes, 1 publication in a good journal, 1 manuscript, and some random awards. I was president of my university's chapter of ACM and have had internships with Google and another top company (trying not to dox myself too hard here...). The internships were in backend web dev and Android respectively, so since my interest has shifted towards ML/Data Science/Mining, it seemed like grad school would be a solid way to pivot, and since i was able to get into funded PhD programs and enjoyed doing research in undergrad, it seemed like a good idea, but I am definitely struggling hard. Any thoughts, experiences, or comments are appreciated!\n\ntl;dr: age 22, graduated with a BS in CSE, immediately started a PhD in Machine Learning, it is extremely difficult, feeling miserable, should I drop out and get a random swe job now, try to stick it out and finish a \"free\" master's to pivot into more ML-centric roles with possibly higher upward mobility, or should I give this PhD a second chance and wait before making any kind of decision.\n\n",

            "selftext": "Hello,\n\nI am a software developer in a local company. This is my first job in the industry and it has only been ~7 months since I started. So far at least half of my time has been spent on learning whatever technology was used in the projects I was assigned to. Currently I am putting together a demo web app using JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, Node.js, etc. I started working on it just 2 weeks ago with no prior knowledge of JavaScript. My first day working on it was very frustrating because I didn't understand anything from the tutorials I read. The next day a coworker spent almost the whole day to help me get started with JavaScript and jQuery, which was a huge relief for me. Since then I learned a lot of stuff about all the technologies I mentioned earlier, but I'm still a beginner. Fortunately my coworkers have a good amount of knowledge and help me whenever I get stuck. However, I still feel frustrated. For example, this morning I got stuck at something for a while, then asked a coworker who was able to help, but I felt very angry because of my lack of knowledge.\n\nI am aware shouldn't blame myself for not knowing things, and I'm doing my best to learn as much as I can. My coworkers gave me thumbs up for being open to learning and taking initiative, which tells me I'm doing something right. But I still get very frustrated for not knowing enough. Unfortunately I can't just take a week or two to study because of deadlines. And I feel very uncomfortable jumping into something without gaining a certain amount of knowledge about it, which people at work are aware of. Sometimes they tell me not to spend too much time on trying to learn everything and just finish the task however I can (for example, when we do a proof of concept), which leads me to my dilemma.\n\nI can study outside of work hours to catch up with current technologies. That would fix my problems at work, right? But I already spend almost all my time at work ( I work until 6 pm) and when I go home I feel tired and don't want to do anything. At home I force myself to do my workouts, and by the time I'm done with exercise and dinner it's time for bed. Saturdays are mostly spent on sleeping because I have trouble sleeping during the week (it's really bad, my doctors are still trying to figure out what's wrong). Sundays are completely spent on chores like groceries, cleaning, laundry, cooking for the week, etc. I feel like I'm not doing anything anything for fun, which is why I don't want to do anything work related outside of work. For context I guess I should mention that I am diagnosed with anxiety and major depressive disorder, and until the end of last year I had been a student. I spent the last 10 years at grad school and as time passed I became more and more burnt out. A month after I started my current job I got hospitalized because I was overwhelmed with everything and I was highly suicidal. It took a small army of medical staff and months of self care to recover a bit from a lifetime of troubles. I don't want to relapse, and I don't want to pause life to get work done like I did in school. So, I don't know if this makes sense, but I don't want to spend the limited time I have outside of work on more work stuff. I want to have a life, have a couple of friends, have some hobbies... But that means I will keep getting frustrated at work. I really don't know what to do other than to accept the situation, which I think is the logical thing to do. However I'm not doing that, am I?\n\nI don't know what I'm really asking. I guess, how do you balance life and work? Or how do you have a fulfilling life? Or some advice?..",

I have already taken the following courses for the minor:  \n-Intro (obviously)  \n-Data Structures / Intro to Alg.  \n-Discrete Math  \n-Computer Architecture / Systems  \n-Software Development Methods  \n\nAvailable to me for next semester are:  \n-Algorithms  \n-Operating Systems  \n-Principles of Programming Languages  \n-Data Analysis  \n-Data Mining  \n-Computer Graphics  \n-Probably Others I've missed  \n\nI want to be able to get my foot in the door for software development when I graduate; which classes will best allow this to happen?  Are there any missing from my list that I should look in to?

The starting compensation package I was offered was a little lower than my expectations, but a compensation increase was written into my offer that would have ultimately made the role worth while. \n\nAs I am approaching the increase however, I asked my boss to confirm the increase and was told that funding was tight and I would need to hold out until they were in a better financial position to bump up my compensation. I was not given a timeline or any indication that the capacity would be present in the near future. This puts me in a tricky spot because I had budgeted for the increase to make my personal finances work for this role (the base compensation barely covers my personal costs and the huge increase in commuting spending I needed to take the role).\n\nI really just need advice on how to approach my boss about this.

            "selftext": "So basically I started a job at the same time as two other guys. I\u2019m 23 and they\u2019re in their mid forties. \n\nThe company is using classic ASP and they want to have it all converted into a .NET environment. At first look of the application I decided that it would best if we implemented the following features:\n\nEntity framework / DB First\nMVC instead of WebForms\nSource control (TFS)\nManager/Repository pattern\nUnit testing\n\nThose are the major things which we\u2019ve had presentations on and ultimately the business has decided to go with them. \n\nThe issue comes with one of the guys who constantly states how his old ways of developing applications are better than what we\u2019re not implementing. He\u2019s the only person on the team who\u2019s having issues. Just yesterday he was saying how he \u2018preferred WinMerge\u2019 as he doesn\u2019t like Microsoft making code changes for you during the source control merge. And this how he reacts with with DB first of entity framework too. \n\nNot only that, during a code review yesterday I suggested he moved code into the manager as he\u2019s written the same thing 3 times and it could be unit tested. He replied \u2018why would it need to be unit tested and nobody would change the functionality\u2019. He just completely misses the point most of the time. \n\nI don\u2019t know how I can get through to him, he\u2019d be much happier writing code legacy ADO.NET SQL queries in the code behind instead of using entity framework and putting them in repositories to be reused. \n\nIt becomes an issue because he gets frustrated and begins to get rude with me about it. I\u2019m positive he doesn\u2019t like it that I\u2019m the junior dev bringing in these changes too. However, none of these guys have kept up to date with current technologies and so it\u2019s on me to bring these features into light. \n\nWhenever we discuss new features he always responds with nothing but negative things to say. And sometimes he doesn\u2019t even make sense. For example with the discussion to move to MVC from web forms one of his arguments against it was because \u2018MVC was new and therefore must have more bugs\u2019. Like what? It\u2019s been around almost 10 years\n\nEveryone else is happy, just this one guy. Has anyone experienced something similar? If so how did you solve it?\n\nUPDATE:\n\nThanks for all your replies.\n\nJust to preface this, I will offer some more details. I started at this company little over a month ago, they are using classic ASP systems and want to move to .NET. Me and two other guys have been hired to do the job, those 2 are contract to hire and I\u2019m permanent. \n\nSo I went to speak to the manager, I didn\u2019t go in pointing fingers and blaming him. I went in and explained that I would like to alter the way I speak to the guy to get a more productive conversation with him to find out why he doesn\u2019t want to change. However I did mention that I thought the way he spoke to me a few time were rude. \n\nShe gave me some advice on how to speak with him and explained that the business is in agreement with the ideas and that I have been very polite and patient with the guy and they appreciate it.  She also said that if I feel like he continues to be rude to speak to her more about it. \n\nSo it was a productive conversation. Like I said, I didn\u2019t want to go in pointing the finger and I didn\u2019t want to get anyone fired or anything. I just want to have more constructive conversations to why this guy doesn\u2019t like the ideas. \n\nSECOND EDIT: He got fired. I feel bad. But I think it\u2019s because of a variety of issues which the team had with him. ",

            "selftext": "Hi all, I'm a frequent visitor to this sub but wanted a throwaway to get this off my chest. \n\nAbout a month ago, a small startup reached out to me for a frontend engineering position on their team. Over the last few weeks, I've done multiple phone screens and did a coding project as part of the interview process. All of those calls and project went smoothly, and so they invited me for an onsite at their office. \n\nI didn't stress too much preparing for this interview - it would be great interview practice either way. However, literally the day before my onsite, I noticed that someone had shared an article that they wrote on a public tech careers group that I was in. I first clicked it out of curiosity, and it detailed their job search process over the last few months. The shocker was that they had just accepted a position at the same startup for the exact same role I was about to do my onsite for.\n\nThen I immediately checked the company's open job positions and noticed that the frontend engineer role was removed. \n\nA lot of options ran through my mind -- maybe they were hiring multiple people for this position? But why would they take that particular listing down? Did they not want to be awkward and cancel my interview? But a 4 hour interview involving all the top engineers and execs without the expectation of hiring would be a waste of everyone's time. \n\nIn the end, I decided to go do the onsite anyway as interview practice and possibly consider the job if I got an offer, but went in with lowered expectations. I almost expected one of the interviewers to mention that the position was no longer available, and if I would be interested in doing backend work instead. But no one mentioned anything about it, and neither did I. In the end, I felt like I got along with a lot of the interviewers I talked to, and left with a pretty positive feeling about how I did. \n\nNot surprisingly, I got a rejection from them the next day. In their email, they decided to \"move forward with other candidates\". Since it's still fresh in my mind, I have a weird mixture of feelings, but mostly annoyance since it feels similar to getting rejected from a safety school.

I will be here till late next year. I can't work here (visa laws, language barrier), but I am financially set until I move back to the states\u2013at which point I will be trying to get my first entry-level job, hopefully in a different state than the one I went to school, meaning I can't really leverage my existing network (profs, friends in industry, etc.)\n\nI have two internships: one that basically amounted to a bunch of one-off freelance-type projects building login pages and tweaking Wordpress sites. The other was with a municipal government writing Python scripts to pull data from legacy machines for use in GIS. I also had a TA job for a year before graduating.\n\nRight now, I am trying to take in the experience of being abroad while maintaining constant low-level anxiety about my employability back in the states when the clock runs out. I have been learning new stuff (JS frameworks, Ruby) and spending time on interesting personal projects. The entry level seems so competitive, though, that I don't know if this makes a difference, even if the projects are impressive.\n\nSo, the core questions: how do you stay employable during downtime? How do you prepare yourself for the job hunt when you'll be doing it in a different country or state?",

I graduated from undergrad last May, hired as a SWE1 by a Fortune 500 company thats been around since the late 90s doing iOS develop on an app that was just released last year. I say I am in a unique situation because, 4 months into the job, my team was relocated across the nation and only two of us chose to move across while everyone else, including our manager, left. So around the move time, we starting rebuilding the team. As a new grad, I interviewed my now manager, as well as two other new engineers.\n\nNow my only co-worker, who is a SWE2, moved with me has not contribute much since finding out about the team cross nation move. In terms of work, from the start I have been working with product and our engineering manager to weigh stories, convince them that we should do certain stories such as tech debt sooner than later. Especially since our manager left us, I took reigns of responsibilities that an engineering manager would have, coordinating with other tech teams, establishing best practices and standards. I effectively became the tech lead leading efforts to improve the code base architecturally, guiding our new hires, making key architectural decisions, establishing best practices, deprecating and replacing code and frameworks, developing new Swift-y frameworks for the other iOS apps in the company to consume, managing CI/Build Machine, and enabling the app to scale. All while only now being one year and two months into the job.\n\nMy goal was to get a promotion by my one year mark so I brought it up to my manager three months before hand. We got the paperwork up to the higher ups, but for the next weeks,  they have only told me it takes a while for a decision. I settled for a promotion by the end of the year. Come this Monday, my manager finally comes back to me and says that my promotion was denied because the mid cycle promotion cap was reached and that I have to wait till the end of the next cycle. My company has two regular promotion cycles, mid year and start of next year.  So I would have to wait 4 months to be considered for promotion again.\n\nI'd like to say that my work is what I value, not my title. But it totally sucks that my co-worker is a SWE2, not contributing that much, and I am essentially performing as a SWE3.\n\nI can comfortably say that if I left, the team would probably slow down in progression so much as I know 90% of the code base and was responsible for 100% of the mass efforts against improving app performance and cutting tech debt since the move. Even my manager admits I am the sole high performing member of the team. I want to stay with this team because it is a great experience for me as a new grad to essentially be a team lead. Consulting with others, I have so much leverage and that I should interview and take an offer to my current company. I'd feel bad, but its just what you gotta do to get them to realize. Hiring is expensive and treating employee properly is cheaper.\n\nWhat would you guys suggest/think?",

I liked my internship and I wouldn't mind working there full time. However, I would like to explore other companies while I have the chance as a junior.\n\nI spoke with the company on extending the deadline but it doesn't seem like I can do it. From what I gathered, their program for internships is small so they have to plan far in advance.\n\nRight now, I am applying to the big tech companies. I asked Google on their time frame and they said it would take 6-8 weeks. I don't think I can get that much of an extension with the company.\n\nI live in an at-will state so I can renege the offer. However, I don't want to renege on the offer because I would be interested in a full time position there.\n\nThanks,\n\nedit: forgot the question: Should I accept the offer from the company or wait for another company?",

EDIT: also bootcamp is not an option.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nSo my situation is, I'm in college  majoring in programming (Just programming,  not really any computer science) and already I'm loosing faith in the school. You see, I'm on my fifth semester and we've already had courses in fundamental programming, data structures, databases, and HTML/CSS.  However, simply because now we're on a new language (JavaScript) the school feels it needs to continue the routine of taking two to three months getting us acquainted with the basics all over again; I'm talking variables, loops, if/else conditions, etc. And *this* after doing OOP in Java making a JavaFX desktop app. \n\nHonestly, I'm just taking it for the sheepskin due to what I hear about HR departments. Having said that, I *know* based on what I've learned here that I need some substantial side projects, possibly a frequented GitHub account, and a good amount of practice solving coding problems to get my foot in the door. I know that in the end I'm going to have to teach and practice on my own.\n\nBut the problems is this: I don't have any flippin' time. My wife and I had our second child this past February, we both work full time jobs and mine includes weekends. If I'm not at work I'm watching the kids, and for those of you who have babies, you know they need constant attention. \n\nI don't know about you guys, but when I'm coding, or trying to write an app, or just playing around with problems on CodeWars/Leetcode, I tend to quit out of frustration once I face too many outside interruptions. And by interruptions I mean blood curled screaming because I'm not showing attention. So needless to say my progress as a software developer student has slowed to a crawl - I'm coding maybe three hours a week and it's usually on my lame homework.\n\nAnyway, my situation won't be changing anytime soon, it's just not economically feasible at this time. So here I see myself competing with others who don't have the same responsibilities and who are years younger (I'm 32). Does anybody think this dream is worth pursuing in my situation?\n\nThanks.",

Not only is there no website, no LinkedIn, or any kind of web presence, but they have A LOT of bad reviews from past employers on Glassdoor. \n\nNow, I know how a lot of people feel about bootcamp graduates, but most of the people in my cohort and even the cohort that very recently finished after my own all have jobs and I am starting to feel very discouraged and left in the dust. \n\nShould I start lowering my standards?

On the other hand, I feel like my knowledge base is not at the level expected for the company, and having been on the other side of the table when interviewing candidates from my prior career, I know how much it sucks to have your time wasted by someone unqualified.

I feel like I am actually best at talking and soft skills, and I'm still unsure what I enjoy doing the most out of the options. \n\nThe most straightforward path (as I live in the SF Bay Area) is to become an engineer and according to averages, make about 100k. I also am curious about technical recruiting and sales engineering, as I can incorporate my soft skills there. However, and maybe these are just outliers, a couple friends of mine told me about the money involved and it was lower than I had assumed. People often ask \"what is it you're looking for\" with these types of threads, and the honest answer is that while I want to work a moderate amount and do what I enjoy/am good at, I feel behind financially and shouldn't accept anything too far below 100k.\n\nSo I suppose my questions will apply to both technical recruiting and sales engineering - \n\n1) How hard is it to break into either of these two roles with no experience other than some retail experience and college student organization recruiting experience?\n\n2) Does anyone have friends in the area who are in either of these roles and how much do they make?\n\n3) Any strong opinions from those friends as to the positives or negatives of pursuing either path?

So basically, by the end of October.  However, the few companies I am really interested in working for won't get back to me until mid-November.   I am graduating in December so I am scrounging for a job, so I would happily take the first one, but it is my back up.  I didn't want to mention anything now because I wanted an offer in hand first.  But once I receive the offer, would it be bad if I asked for an extension right away? I could possibly need until about November ~20th to make a decision, first round of interviews early November then second round mid November.  Is the worst thing that could happen is they say no and we need an answer within two weeks?  I won't have any other offers by the time that two weeks is up.  This company was extremely fast and the other few companies that have mutual interest are working more slowly.   Should I be expecting them to offer an extension or is that rare? I can't really pressure the other companies to hurry up because they like to wait for all interviews to finish before making hiring choices. ",

After I quit and was ready to start at the new position told me that they had lost funding and couldn't bring me on.\n\nSo now I'm just job searching, trying to find anyone that'll take me, honestly spending about 8 hours a day on this.

            "selftext": "Not American, but need advice. I graduated from a not very good school a little over a year ago as a software developer. I took a job at a small company straight away, where I was really miserable.\n\n I found another job, which I started in July. It was a huge change. Friendly people, more professional, much more interesting work. It has 50 employees, but is 15 years old, and only within the last few years has worked towards having a real development team. The development team is currently a senior dev, two off-shore Indian devs and myself. They're all around 40 or 50 and very skilled from what I can tell. The senior dev is a fantastic person and always super helpful. So why am I worried?\n\nThe company is in a bit of an odd state right now. It was doing great right up until around the time that I was employed, where it'd been through a merger, and lost a significant client, which was, from my understanding, inevitable.\n\nI think I was hired for a few reasons. The criteria they stated to be critical during the job interviews were that the candidate should be able to understand content of the work and should be enthusiastic about taking the company to the next level in terms of code quality, version control etc., which I definitely am. So I was very happy to take the offer when it came.\n\nReality hasn't turned out that way exactly. The first month was very slow. My boss was away on vacation for the first two weeks, and they'd only prepared two tasks for me, which were done in two days. Also none of the code base was under version control, so I spent a few days uploading all the different projects. It was tedious work, since there were several copies from different developers of many of the projects. After that I was scrounging for anything to do. In the following months, I've been given a lot tasks I would consider to be not very interesting. For example, a misunderstanding from my boss meant that we received an entire web application from an outsourced developer in SQL Server, and I had to spend a week simply translating all the data access.\n\nToday I was invited by our COO along with the senior developer to a meeting with him about a task from a new, big client, which the company sorely needs. I was happy at first until the senior dev told me, he'd asked the COO to invite me too, which isn't the first time. It worries me, because I'm starting to see a pattern of all the critical tasks going to senior dev - everybody values his input including me - while I'm receiving these tasks that don't have much to do with getting into and learning the core of the company's software that it relies on. So at this point, I feel like I'm just there to take assignments, which would distract the senior dev from doing more valuable work. That's fair enough, but it worries me that I have to work on all these other tasks in different projects, when what I really wanted was to get to work alongside him on these more interesting tasks. Currently all devs are just sitting on their own, in their own projects. I'm not very happy with it, I miss actively working on the same code base with someone the same way I did as a student.\n\nMy manager and I had a conversation to assert how it was going after the first 2\u00bd months. He said I was doing exceptionally and surpassing all his expectations, which I was really happy about. I laid out my concern with not working on the more complex tasks. He claimed I was already doing some decently complex work in some of the tasks I was doing, and that I shouldn't worry, because those tasks would come with time. For some reason I don't trust that statement. I'm generally just worried that I'm not smart or skilled enough to be accepted as someone who can work on these tasks.\n\nFurthermore I spent a bunch of my free time doing things like setting up automatic build and deployment, because deployment is currently done by compiling on the developers machine, remoting into one of our servers and copy pasting the .exe file there. My manager was very excited about this, specifically because he'd had a headache regarding the Indian devs not being legally allowed to work with customers data, so this could solve that problem. The problem here is that the budget is closed, and he insists on setting up the build and deployment server on its own separate server. So all that work is null and avoid. It was a bit of a hit considering how important he'd stated it was to improve the quality of the company's software development.\n\nMost people could probably go on like this for a while about things that bother them in the workplace. I think what bothers me the most is that I feel depressed and worried that I'm not smart enough to actually get to work on anything interesting anywhere. I've been considering multiple ways of improving myself. Lately I've been solving a Leetcode problem per night and trying to combine personal interests and improving professionally by learning about crypto currencies. I also generally try to read about proper software design, and smart ways to make a lot of tedious work easier. I've also been thinking about going back and studying at a better school or joining meetups. I feel like if I'm this exhausted just trying to become a mediocre developer that can get to work on more interesting tasks than some of the things I'm currently doing, what are my chances really then of ever getting to work on something I find to be interesting?",

I am hoping to find a career that relates to one (or more?) of these topics \n* I have significant leadership and teamwork experience (I was a residential assistant for 2 years and captain of my sports team for 6 years leading us to compete internationally)\n* I love all things related to space exploration and my dream would be to work for NASA or another space-related company doing some sort of computer science research or software engineering job\n\n**Here are some specific questions I have:**\n\n* What sort of entry level jobs should I be looking for if my ultimate goal is to work for space exploration companies or in the field(s) listed above\n* What \"extra\" things can I do on the side to ensure I am continually growing my skills (reading journals, joining IEEE, hackathons, side projects, etc?)\n* In general what does a \"career goal\" look like (maybe an example of a goal you have set for yourself)? How do I put these down on paper? Are these big, little, etc?\n* Do I need a \"x year plan\" ? What does that look like?\n* I am not sure if I would ever want to advance to a managerial position as I like programming and computer science. Has anyone made the transition? What are the benefits/drawbacks? Do you still get to do the \"dirty work\" or are you mostly managing people?\n\nThanks /r/cscareerquestions for always providing great information.

However I have been working as a full stack developer for 2 years now and I am finding that my passion for programming is dying. I don't feel like doing anything to improve my programming anymore, I just go home after 8 hours and waste my time watching tv. I also resent the fact that I couldn't get into something more 'hardcore' like programming but I feel like I don't have it in me to get into it.\n\nWhat do I do?

            "selftext": "I joined a startup right when i graduated, and over the last 5 years i have ended up becoming the team lead for the dev team. Every single performance evaluation i have received an outstanding evaluation and i have a very good working relationship with our CTO/CEO. \n\nAbout 5 months ago we ended up hiring a senior developer Anon. Anon seemed like a great fit, and had some glowing recommendations and came from a company that did something similar to us.\n\nDuring our second one on one they told me that:\n\n* I wasn't qualified to be team lead due to only having 5 years experience.\n* They didn't feel comfortable with my decision making process.\n* They also found progress to be extremely slow for their liking\n\nWhich kind of came to me as shock, and when i pressed for suggestions and made my self open to recommendations and improvements i was brushed aside.\n\nSince then working with them is the single most draining thing at work.\n\n* Lately they have just gone straight to our CTO with anything, and when our CTO rebukes them and sends them my way. They just drop whatever issue they have, and avoid me.\n* Anon seems to fight and argue about every single task assigned, and often times try to overrule me on every little thing. During our last sprint planning session Anon basically said \"I don't think this sprint planning is working out\", and pulled up their own version of the sprint plan. Thankfully our CTO shut them down, but it still looks really bad.\n* Anon constantly tries to interject and become involved with absolutely everything. For example recently me and a coworker, were discussing AWS costs, and anon basically forces their way into the conversation, saying stuff like \"Our AWS setup feels immature, and doesn't seem fine tuned at all, but i have experience using AWS let me redo it all from scratch\". \n* Anon is constantly pushing us telling us we need to \"rewrite large chunks of our product\" because we have too much technical debt in this area in their opinion. When the people who work on these components and services have the opposite opinion. \n* Atleast once a week we get an email from Anon at 2-3am saying they will be late, because they spent all night doing me or another devs work because it was \"blocking\" them, and typically is an indirect jab at my planning skills. \n\nMost of the other senior developers apparently despise working with this person. Last time i went on vacation for a week anon more or less fought hard to more or less take over the role as acting team lead from the person i assigned it to, and i came back to chaos. Unfortunately several of the other senior developers, just don't want to fight or argue with this person so they get walked all over. Unfortunately as our company has become bigger and bigger our CTO has less and less times to take part in the day to day affairs of dev, so we loose that power check. \n\nI have offhandedly mentioned how difficult this person is to work with to our CTO, however i feel addressing or complaining to him about this person will come off as me looking petty. What should i be doing? I am really not the most dominant type of person. \n\nI apologize if this comes off as whiny, this is just really burning me out. ",

It is primarily a helpdesk job and while occasionally I get to do some cool switching and routing configuration I mostly do very simple things and run 5 or 6 linux commands. I am also pretty sure that I'm the only one with a 4 year degree here and I am starting to feel like this will be a dead end job making way less than my friends who are coding(who are all pulling 10-15k more a year than I'm making now), unless I return BACK to school to start learning certifications all over the damn place. I also miss the thinking and creative components of programming which is mostly absent in my current role. Am I right to want to start looking for jobs that are actual software coding jobs? Should I feel ashamed for being hired onto a company and wanting to leave after only 3 months? Would a software company who asks why I'm looking for a new job after 3 months understand my reasoning? I really value integrity when I work so this is really making me feel bad as the company that's hired me has been great, but I also don't want to spend my life replacing hard drives and just turning interfaces up and down.\n\nP.S.

            "selftext": "I'm a senior in CS at one of what they call top CS college. I interned at MS this past summer. Fortunately, I left with a return offer with a deadline approaching next week. I'm still in the process of interviewing other companies, all of which wanted to know when my deadline was. This was only about 10 days ago when multiple companies approached me with the first round interviews. I was hesitant to tell them that I have a deadline approaching quickly, so I haven't replied back to any of them yet. \n\nI've basically been asking (nicely) my recruiter at MS about extending the deadline so that I could talk to other companies; two recruiters were unexpectedly adamant about unwilling to give me an extension. \n\nI'm thinking about telling MS that I won't be able to respond back to them until I finish my interview process with other companies. I plan to get through the other interviews as quickly as possible so that I have all my options by the end of this month. So my question then is: how likely will MS take back the offer at the end of the month when all my other interviews go south and the only offer I receive(d) is from MS? \n\nI feel very fortunate to have been offered a spot at MS, but I feel like I'll only be able to accept the offer with regrets and doubts if I don't get the chance to look at all the cards on the table.\n\nThanks for y'all's wisdom in advance!",

            "selftext": "Hello,\n\nSo I finished my third year of CS, and was doing an internship over the summer, and it was supposed to go for 16 months. Some personal stuff happened, and I am no longer with the company. \n\nThus, I am now looking to fill the time. I don't want to go back to school January yet, since the courses I want to take require prerequisites from the Fall term, so I'd have to graduate May 2019 anyways. \n\nSo my current plan is to hopefully find other internship/co-op positions for the upcoming Winter term, and for the Summer term. Then, go back to school, finish my last 2 semesters, graduate. \n\nMy search for Winter positions hasn't been too kind to me, and the only place I've heard back was for an unpaid position (surprise surprise). It is for a Full Stack Web Dev position, working with rather interesting technologies that I think I would benefit greatly from learning. Of course, it is still unpaid. \n\nMy question is: given my situation, is taking this unpaid internship for the Winter term worth it? I am not too confident in my ability to land another placement for the Winter term, and I really don't want to continue being a part-time student, and I don't want to just sit around working on personal projects. \n\nAny thoughts or comments are definitely welcome!\n\n[Here is my resume](http://docdro.id/kTG6bfi), if any kind soul has suggestions on improving it. \n\nThanks in advance,",

I was wondering if it would be worth listing next to my GPA?\n\n- right now im currently double majoring computer science and finance. My GPA is 3.4 and the majority of my coursework has been computer science so far, but I was thinking that my double major might go against me. I feel that some recruiters think finance is boosting my GPA since it's arguably an easier major, and that there might be negative stigmas in general against people studying business. the majority of my coursework has been computer science so i  was thinking of not listing a double major on my resume if the company is more tech oriented.\n-  lastly, is 3.4 considered too low to list on a resume? I heard the rule was 3.0 and above, but I have also heard 3.5 is the cutoff. \n\nthanks for the advice guys :)\n\n",

            "selftext": "Hello!\n\nI have been out of school nearly 2 years, and I feel as if have approximately no useful or marketable industry experience.\n\n\nI graduated at the end of fall 2015 with a Bachelor\u2019s in CS from a small, low ranking college with a ~3.7 GPA.  I was excited to start my first job as a programmer/developer very early in 2016.  However, immediately after starting my enthusiasm was steadily drained by the fact I had no work to do.\n\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I asked for work and tried to stay busy and make myself useful and anything else that I could think of.  No matter what I tried, my job was simply \u201cBe here by 8:00 sharp. Don\u2019t leave before 5:00.\u201d  I felt useless, and it was driving me insane so I ended up applying for other jobs and leaving after about 10 months. (I don\u2019t think they were very happy that I left.)  I only got a few responses from any of my applications, and took a slight pay cut figuring that for my own sanity it would be well worth it.\n\n\nI\u2019ve now been at my new job (government work) for close to a year, and I absolutely hate it.  The environment seems to be the bane of all productivity.  The little bit of software development work we have is for a nightmarish legacy system.  Imagine a bug fix or update that should take 1-2 developers a week or two maximum morphed into a 12-24 month waterfall-behemoth process involving 20 people (only ~3.5 developers) with a price tag of $3.5 million.  Most of this time is eaten up through paperwork, meetings, project planning, scheduling\u2014an endless hot potato of passing around technical responsibility.  (I\u2019ve yet to see one of these tasks brought to completion no matter how simple, everything is always \u201cin the pipeline.\u201d)  Technical designs are reviewed by people that don\u2019t know how the system was coded or how the pieces fit together, and then we are lectured about how design element X is a problem because of [Insert arbitrary reason presented with inspiringly confident ignorance that makes no sense to any of the technical people, but is met with nodding approval by the council of potato passers.]\n\n\nThere are only a few actual developers in the group (us \u201cdumb young kids\u201d and a couple slightly more senior developers that were recently hired), yet the management and every non-developer has seniority over anyone with technical knowledge.  Things like getting an appropriate software development environment set up for a task are miserable (\u201cIt\u2019s in the pipeline\u201d).  Our computers are pretty locked down, and we can get fired for installing anything thing (we have to go through a lengthy process to get anything installed, e.g.  waiting two weeks to get an IDE installed only to find that the compiler that you requested along with it wasn\u2019t installed and then trying to explain to someone who is convinced you have what you asked for why you are actually missing most important part).  Currently we don\u2019t have any version control (\u201cIt\u2019s in the pipeline\u201d), and I have to take my code to a different computer via CD to actually compile.  It is also killing me to know for a fact that most people who are somehow \u201cintegral to the process\u201d have twice the salary that I do, and do nothing but make my job more tedious.  There are a hundred other frustrations (many of which are \u201cin the @#$! pipeline,\u201d whatever the @#$! they even think this means), but at this point I am just ranting.\n\n\nI am always miserable and exhausted by the end of the day, despite never having really been able to accomplish much.\n\nBut I am stuck\u2014for two more years.  I received a $13,500 signing bonus with a 3 year period which I do not want to pay back, and their 401k matching will be vested at 3 years.  Additionally, I feel like it would quite possibly make finding future jobs even harder if my resume showed that I left my first two jobs out of college each within a year.  EDIT: Maybe this just seems like a lot to me since my salary is only just over $50k/y.  This is also guaranteed by their offer to go up to $75k by the end of the 3rd year, which I am hoping will make it easier to negotiate a better salary at my next job.  (63k at the end of 2nd year, and 75k at the 3rd)\n\n\nSo I guess my questions are:\n\nDo you have any advice for dealing with a job that you hate, but are stuck with for the time being?\n\nWhat can I do while working full time to be prepared to land mid-level jobs at the end of this 3 years (4 years out of college)?\n\nDo you have any advice for down the road on how to ensure I end up in a more productive and less needlessly stressful environment?\n\nThanks!",

            "selftext": "Hello! Not sure if this is the right place to post this but here goes:\n\nUnfortunately this 'might' be a little bit of an essay, and I thank anyone who reads through this whole thing and posts a response :)\nTrying to keep it concise: I'm 30, currently running technical operations at a small (4 employees) recording studio in Hong Kong (where I've lived half my life. Hong Kong. Not the studio. That'd be weird). Love my job; being only 4 of us we all do many jobs, my main duties include audio engineer/edit/mix/master, network manager, IT support, data archive and backups, and more. Also I taught myself everything I know about this job with help from Google and trial and error, no degree or teacher. However the reasons I love my job have nothing to do with my career - it's JUST this studio and the people I work with (husband and wife and other relative who treat me like family). \n\nBasically due to certain events over the past couple of years, I'm now struggling with depression and anxiety, and it's got to the point where I soon need to move back to the UK to be closer to my family. I'm also very unhappy with the state of the film and TV industry and I've kind of lost interest in it; and I rediscovered a passion I had when I was a teenager - coding! I was obsessed with computing when I was a kid, learned BASIC on a commodore 64 and tore apart and rebuilt the family PC several times when no-one was looking to see how it all worked... but I had a big falling out with my IT teacher at school and I kind of left that passion for computing behind... but now I've re-discovered it and I'm addicted. \n\nANYWAY. I'm a little worried that even if I learn enough to competently write code enough for a profession, without any experience I won't know any industry practices, such as - are there proper standards for commenting code, rather than just whatever _I_ think is good? How do professionals indent their code, again, is there a proper standard? Are there standards for other things I should really be aware of?\n\nAlso, I get that to be a professional, you can't just know one language... When you are fluent in one language, say for example C++ which I'm currently learning (I have many reasons why I chose C++, not really important), how much time does it take to learn another language, say, Java, or C#? How proficient should I be in C++ before I start learning another language? How proficient in several languages is someone expected to be to get a job in the industry? I don't want to get ahead of myself, and end up accidentally mixing up C++ functions and syntax with Java for example. I know that all people are different and someone could theoretically learn multiple languages at once - but I've read several times that it's recommended to become proficient in one language to start with.\n\nI've also been learning how to use git and so by extension how to, in theory, write code with others, version control and all that stuff, so I hope that's a good start?\n\nI know that was sort of a textual-diarrhoea spew but I feel a little unsure, and it's a bit more complicated than the professional knowledge I've google-learned in the past :P\n\nMany thanks in advance!\n\np.s. obviously when I say google, I mean any resource I can get my hands on.",

Another factor is that I don't want to jump into a improper solution, despite not having any solutions up front.\n\nI can ask my boss to give me more time to research a solution, but I know inside that may not be the best solution.

So instead of picking up internships at large companies or hitting up career fairs, my first job search experience after graduation was go to the software jobs section on Craigslist and pick from a couple of companies there. \n\nBut even after I stopped using CL for jobs a long time ago, the quality of companies and jobs didn't seem to get better over time. \n\nI once explained the situation to a former co-worker and he told it to me like this: \"you're a hired gun\". That is, I get job offers only to fix up bad messes, work on side projects their main employees don't have time for, or otherwise stay for one project, rather than to keep me around for the long haul. However, I don't want to be that guy anymore. I don't want to work for a places that don't have anyone from above to give technical direction, that don't automate their testing, that don't have formal build processes in general. As it turns out, I'm mediocre at that. I need my own technical guidance.\n\nAnd what make that situation worse is I'm in a \"learning burnout\" of sorts. Spending my own time to learn the new tools and frameworks is taking a toll on me. I wouldn't mind doing this on company time, but local companies where I live expect you to know all the stuff beforehand. There was hardly anyone technical to learn from at the places I worked for.\n\nI need to find work at a larger company that has a good selection of developers, that can talk shop all day and teach me what I've been doing wrong that I have to catch up on. My resume gets rejected so that needs work first. I'm not applying to the best of the best in the tech hubs, just larger corporations in my local area. Some of them are all tech and some are in other industries, but with a development team still. \n\nNone of the types of places, where I'm supposed to go to grow as a developer, don't respond to my resume.

You can code virtually anywhere and people's talent doesn't depend on location. I've met plenty of great programmers who are Indian, or eastern European. I've also met plenty of terrible American programmers and seen messy spaghetti code that was produced in America.\n\nOf course, I'm not saying that bad work doesn't exist in countries where tech work is outsourced to. It certainly does. But the common /r/cscareerquestions notion that work that's outsourced to offices in Asia, eastern Europe, etc is of bad quality doesn't seem to make much sense to me. \n\nSo can someone explain 1) if this common train of thought is even true at all and 2) if it is false, then why does it exist?",

What do you think?**\n\nBackground on me: work at a Big4, think I'm pretty good at interviewing. I've also conducted over a hundred interviews (as the interviewer).\n\nLooking around at the interview prep resources, there's absolutely TONS of technical information--everything you need to brush back up on info you hopefully learned in college.\n\nBut I couldn't find anything really on overall interview meta-strategy, and I found pretty much nothing on general mental-game advice. I think this really terrible because based on my experience chatting with friends and reading online, the biggest issues (educated) people have with interviews is messing up problems they should've been able to solve.\n\nWhat do I mean by meta-strategy? Basically how you approach problem solving at a high level. The classic/naive example of this is \"don't try to find the optimal solution first\". But there's a ton more to talk about here that I'm not seeing discussed.\n\nWhat do I mean by mental-game? Nothing mysterious here, simply basic tactics to help you relax before and between interviews. Further, I think there's a lot to be said about concrete ways to keep your cool when with an asshole interviewer or when you make an inevitable mistake.\n\nLastly, as an interviewer, I think I can sprinkle in some other pieces of advice that I haven't seen elsewhere.\n\nI'm thinking about and would appreciate feedback on:\n\n1. Do others think this would be valuable for me to share?\n2. What format would be best for distribution? My current best idea is a video course on a platform like Udemy.\n3.

However, after receiving my flight details, I don't feel like going anymore. Two things:\n\n1. I said I didn't want to leave any earlier than time X and they scheduled it two hours before X.\n2. The return flight is god fucking brutal. I have a layover arriving at 6am Eastern and have to wait three hours at the layover airport before taking the second leg. I have another interview coming up the day after so I don't know if I want to go into it sleep-deprived. When they said they'd fly me back \"the evening of\" the interview I didn't know that meant arriving at 10am the next morning... causing me to miss other obligations\n\nAre flight times usually this bad? Maybe it's normal and I'm just a picky prick, but I just wanted to double check.\n\nAlso, would it be wrong to turn this down now after I agreed to go onsite?",

            "selftext": "I started my job in April about a month before I graduated. I was immediately put on a massive project, basically by myself with almost no collaboration or mentorship. This project is also very complicated, as it is a data ingestion pipeline that has a ton of interconnected and moving parts so there is a lot that can go wrong. I have been left to make most of the design decisions with the occasional input from others when I ask for it, but other than that there are no code reviews or anything like that.\n\nNow, after raising my concerns about all this repeatedly they are finally making some changes and in about a week I will get someone else to work on the project with me. Trouble is I think it might be a little too late. I have written over 10K lines of code and it will probably take anyone several weeks just to get up to speed with a basic understanding of this system.\n\nI am getting pretty overwhelmed with trying to maintain and add features to this code base, as it it volatile and I keep running into issues and there isn't anyone to turn to usually because nobody else understands it. I like being challenged but I feel like I am in over my head here, especially for a recent grad making a modest 55K.\n\nAm I justified in feeling this way or do I need to just suck it up and work through it?

            "score": 25, 
            "selftext": "**The Beginning**\n\nOnce, over a decade ago, I was a hell of a sysadmin. \n\nI moved from a career in desktop support at a major bank into Biztalk administration at a small company, eventually branching out to general Windows system administration after a year. There was much to be learned, and I accepted the challenges head on and met them with vigor, ultimately doing very well at this company. \n\nEventually the opportunity arose that allowed me to move into management, and with one child here with another on the way I decided the management money was irresistable, and moved in that direction. As a result, all of the sysadmin skills that I did *not* use on a daily basis to keep my personal computers running smoothly eventually atrophied, and since I am generally a Linux person, that meant almost all of them. \n\nIn October of last year, I was let go with a large severance, some savings, and a kick in the ass out the door. The company was entangled in legal issues and was cutting staff, and those that made decent amounts of money but were part of a cost-center were the first to go; that was me. What follows is the story of how a middle-aged ex-manager, with little relevant hands-on modern IT experience, eventually scored a job as senior admin with a local MSP.\n\n**How Not to Find Employment**\n\nThe search for a job comparable to my previous employment has been difficult and excruciating both financially and emotionally. For all the talk about companies needing people good at \"soft skills,\" it seems as though mid-level managers with those skills are a dime-a-dozen, thus my search was fruitless. I did find employment, but for a fifth of my previous salary, and did my best to fill in gaps with field contract work. Still, my mortgage dropped to two months behind, right along with my car payment. Weekly phone calls to the bank and mortgage lender were on the agenda; I was plugging holes in the Titanic.\n\nMost people don't like spam, but one of an HR department's primary jobs is sorting through spam from all manner of job-seekers. My initial strategy for a job search consisted of shotgunning resumes to companies with job postings on Indeed, Monster, and other job boards, as well as using recruiters to help sell me to businesses. I found that a single company's career site would allow me to make a profile and use that profile to apply to any and all jobs, so I often applied to everything I am capable of doing. Few companies responded, and those that did were the decent companies responding with rejection emails. Once, I even managed to elict feedback on a rejection for a junior developer application: I did not have at least five years of professional dev experience. After months of rejection, I was fighting off major depression. Something had to change soon. \n\n**A New Strategy**\n\nAfter so many months of being rejected, and reading similar experiences on Reddit and elsewhere, it became clear that, unless I gripped some hands and looked into some eyes, people would forget me as soon as my resume hit the can, and I would never get in front of anyone. The time had come to use those people skills that took forever to build (I am naturally an introvert) to leave enough of an impression that someone might think of me when something opened up.\n\nMy new strategy consisted of going to meetups of any and every kind. It did not matter that I have no knowledge of Mulesoft products or Salesforce development, those meetups were on the agenda. One of the recruiters I was working with also sponsored a networking event on a monthly basis; drink beer, talk to anyone from CEOs to fresh college graduates, and get noticed. These, along with meetups, were a high priority. After several of these types of events, I felt comfortable enough that I could break in on any conversation and hold my own. I did not carry business cards as I felt the experience of exchanging phone numbers or email addresses is far more active than simply handing someone a card and waiting. After leaving each of these events, I would take an hour or so to send a brief message thanking the person for their time and pleasant conversation, and thank the event sponsors as well.\n\n**All Job Hunting is Selling**\n\n\"All I need is an interview, and I can do the rest.\" This is what I tell recruiters during the inescapable first meeting at their offices. With confidence in my social skills and a new emphasis on meeting as many people as possible, I started getting interviews, wherin the second phase of my strategy kicked in. This is arguably the most difficult part, since it involves understanding how to read a room, knowing what a person likes and does not, and using that. I have never been very good at this.\n\nIn one interview, the hiring manager wore a Kermit the Frog t-shirt and jeans, so it was a reasonably safe gamble that this person would appreciate either or all of *Dr. Who*, *Star Wars*, or *Star Trek*. The final question from him at the end of the interview was: \"If you had a choice, would it be Harry Potter's wand, a light saber, sonic screwdriver, or Gandalf's staff?\" As a Trek fan, I quickly noticed that phasers were criminally underrepresented, and my response was indeed neither, that I would always choose the phaser. We all laughed, and the air in the room was relaxed enough that we chatted another thirty minutes about subjects unrelated to employment. \n\nMy next (and last) interview was a bit more gruelling. As I have mentioned, management work was not conducive to maintaining rarely-used technical skills, yet here I was trying to convince someone that I would be a good fit in the company that needed these skills. The recruiters I worked with gave me assessments and allowed references to be used, which put me ahead in a small pool of candidates for certain jobs, yet I felt uneasy about using these results. I compensated for this by highlighting a strong desire and ability to learn quickly, coupled with a strong motivation to succeed, as well as leadership goals. These are qualities developed over time through management of people and projects, and they were the only weapons I had against tepid and irrelevant skills. This particular company assigned personality and reasoning assessments, on each of which I did well enough. Again, I knew enough about the interviewer (and CEO) to mention how *Star Trek: TNG* can present a person with many nice examples of management wisdom, and again that started another long conversation post-interview. \n\n**Luck**\n\nThis interview was my last. I was convinced that it was a waste, that I had completely tanked. As I sat on my front porch talking to my wife about what I would do next, my recruiter called me and put it to me this way: \"You sold the shit out of yourself today. He loves you.\" I was truly shocked. Throughout the process I relied on confidence, positive attitude, willingness to adapt, and persistence. What is undeniable is that I also got lucky; this company was hit hard from a staffing perspective due to the recent hurricane in Florida, and as a result the CEO was willing to take a risk on someone like me. That I project an image of unshakable confidence went a long, long way. \n\nBut there is service after the sale. I made a series of promises to the CEO that I must keep, chief among them is that I will work diligently to upgrade my skills as fast as possible, and that I will become productive quickly. There is no doubt about this. Another promise is that his goals become my goals, and I align myself to the success of the company. At a larger corporation I might only pay lip-service to this, since I would be nothing but a replacable cog, but not here. This company is small enough that I feel comfortable setting and achieving that goal.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nEssentially, despite my atrophied IT acumen, I got a job as a senior admin at an IT MSP through confidence, people skills, and balls.

I've been with this company for a few years, and my most recent raise was from $130k to $140k this March.\n\n\nA few months ago (around July) I ended up with more responsibility as team lead, but with no increase in pay. The company knows I'm not going to leave because I'm applying for a green card under a VISA that binds me to this specific company. The green card will take a few years, so I'm in it for the long haul.\n\n\nI'm on good terms with my manager, and received nothing but positive feedback so far. I don't feel like I'm being grossly underpaid, but I do feel I'm being spineless if I don't ask for a raise what with the most recent change in responsibilities. But I definitely do not have the kind of leverage I would otherwise have if I weren't bound to the company for the next few years because of VISA status.\n\n\nThe quarterly review is this Friday, and I want to ask for a raise. ~~But I'm not sure what to ask for.~~ EDIT: I'm not sure how to approach asking for a raise (phrasing, angle, etc.) Any advice would be very helpful!!\n\n----\nEdit: Since there seems to be confusion - by change in responsibilities, I actually mean I had a change in title, which was officially announced and is considered a \"promotion\"",

I work for a relatively small start up that has a pretty narrow focus, but that focus happens to align with many ideas I have for side projects although they don't directly conflict with any current product or service that we provide and don't expect them to be part of any future product pipeline. These are not necessarily full fledged businesses, but definitely have money-making potential.\n\nI'm aware that using company time or resources to develop these ideas into a proof-of-concept is a no-no, but is there anything I should worry about in terms of developing these ideas on my own time? Should I worry about my company coming after any money I might make from these 'ventures'?\n\nJust wondering if anyone else has experience balancing these two things?",

I'm an Associate Software Developer in a relatively new but fast growing company in Texas. I've finished their \"bootcamp\" and am in the process of getting integrated into my team. The team in question is mostly the devs from another company that mine acquired last year that have been together for 10+ years so they're all pretty familiar with the codebase and each other as well as being pretty set in their ways. My question has to do with file and folder naming conventions in the codebase. When I clone certain repos from git, there are some files/folders that are duplicates just with different capitalization (ex ~/foo/Bar.html and ~/foo/bar.html or ~/folder/file.txt and ~/Folder/file.txt). Being that I am on a Mac and you cannot do that on Macs, when I clone, I only get the first one that it comes across. But then when Git compares my file to the ones on the remote, it compares it to *both* instances and thinks I changed one when I didn't. When I brought this up to the senior dev he told me it was just a problem with my Git configuration and that I had to figure it out on my own. Is he right? Is naming files/folders in this way common/widely accepted? It seems unnecessary and potentially confusing to me.\n\nEdit: Follow up question. How should I bring this up to the team as someone who just joined and doesn't really have much push yet without ruffling too many feathers, particularly with that senior dev I talked to about it already?",

            "selftext": "I graduated in Fall 2016 and have been looking for a job ever since. I've been fairly selective since I have pretty secure job outside of the industry right now and I only want to leave if the pay is right and it seems like a good culture fit. I've just been practicing for interviews, working on some projects, and trying to figure out exactly what I want to do.\n\nI absolutely killed an interview a few weeks ago. Didn't feel like I fucked up any questions and all the whiteboarding problems went pretty well. I definitely bombed a couple interviews about a year ago so it felt pretty good to actually feel almost competent for once. I got the offer the next day. The salary was great ($70k in a low COL city), the benefits were good, and they were offering me relocation assistance. Work-life balance seemed good and everyone I spoke to was friendly.\n\nThe problem was that the work itself was a lot more challenging than anything I ever thought I'd have the option of doing. Without going too much into it, they seemed to prefer someone with an electrical engineering background and someone with a stronger math background. I thought I'd be rejected on that basis alone since my math background is pretty weak and I have no exposure to EE. Obviously they thought I could learn what I needed to on the job but I still feel like I would have disliked the work and felt like a complete fraud every day.\n\nI convinced myself I'd be miserable and fail if I took the offer so I rejected it and it's been bothering me ever since. Looking back, I feel like an idiot turning it down. I'll probably have similar reservations about any decent job but finding that combination of pay, benefits, and culture probably won't happen any time soon. I also feel like there's a chance that I could have enjoyed the work more than I thought once I got past the learning curve. Then I just think about how good my potential career trajectory could have been if I did end up succeeding in the position. And honestly, $70k is still a hell of a lot of money to me at this point in my life.\n\nThe whole experiece has left me wondering if the field is even for me. I know impostor syndrome is a thing (shit, there's a post about it on the first page as I write this) but I feel like it might be more than that. I don't feel like an \"engineer.\" I don't think I think like one, have the talents or interests of one. I really hate and am bad at math. My interest in programming is that it's engaging and sometimes rewarding work and that I feel like I've been challenged and accomplished something when I finish a project. If I wasn't being paid for it, though, I'd never write another line of code in my life. \n\nI don't want to make the same mistake twice - either applying for a position I have no aptitude for or getting a great offer and then turning it down and wasting everyone's time. \n\nWas I right to turn down the position? If another opportunity like that comes along should I take it or would I just be doing myself and the company a disservice? Should I just focus on jobs that involve less technically complex work?",

            "selftext": "I am currently a senior in college majoring in software engineering. I'm living in a semi-major city in the Midwest with a job offer lined up in the same city for when I graduate this upcoming Spring, at a Fortune 500 company that I really like. I moved here from Europe for college and I always had the intention to move somewhere in the coast for various reasons: although I like the area I currently live in, it's too cold here, as well as the city is too small and I feel like the overall life and entertainment opportunities are limited. I've always wanted to move to California, Seattle, New York or Chicago because of how big, lively and diverse these places are. I know this might seem like a dumb reason, but I'm a very extroverted person and having things to do/people to hang out with outside of work is what keeps me sane.\n\nNow the thing is, all my friends are in my current city and I do really like the company that has offered me the full time position. I made friends instantly when I got into college, but everyone was in the same shoes as me back then trying to meet new people, so that might not be the case when I move to the real world after graduation. That's the thing that is holding me back the most to move away.\n\nSo TL;DR, I'm torn between looking for jobs in the cities I mentioned above, which would have as a tradeoff the possibility of working for a company whose culture I might not know, whereas I've already interned for my current company and I love what it has to offer. I just don't see myself living in this state for a long time, the weather is bad, cities are small and there's not much to do. However all my friends are here and I'm afraid of the unknown by moving elsewhere alone, but at the same time I feel like I would waste some of the best years of my early life by staying here longer.\nAny suggestions by someone who might have experienced the same things as me?

After searching around for a bit, I notice a lot of companies have open jobs for the role of \"data engineer,\" which I think fits me fairly well. For instance, I work in scala, work with big data, and have extensively used big data tools like spark, storm, kafka, hadoop, etc. But I also do good ole backend development that doesn't involve data sometimes. Furthermore, I barely know anything about machine learning so that rules out data science. \n\nThe terminology is a bit new to me, is there a significant difference between being a normal backend engineer and data engineer?

Im able to do some coding with automation/unit tests (Mostly JS and Ruby) but I want to get better.\n\nI graduated around 7 years ago, I was an average student (Comp. Science at a pretty decent university). I def. slacked off some and could've done better, but I didn't really \"enjoy\" doing any coding or feel that drive until after college. Still though im a good interviewer and have at least been successful in the QA field for a long while now. I did QA because I did not feel confident in my coding ability after leaving college (The university was VERY heavy on theory without actually much coding).\n\nAnyways, im looking to break back out. I work at a web-dev company now and have done a little bit of \"dev-soul searching\". I did the edX CS50x course to refresh (Still need to do the final project) and did both UT Austin edX Embedded Courses. I thought I liked low level....but maybe not that low of level. I've also done Colt Steele's Webdev course and basically all of the freeCodeCamp front and backend + Algorithmns (Beta).\n\nBasically the things I enjoy in coding:\n\n* I like \"lowish\" level stuff, or dealing with processing data. So i feel like anything on the backend.\n* Im \"ok\" at front-end, but I def. don't enjoy it. I have zero eye for design but I can code it fine. Just looks ugly as sin.\n* I like interacting with the database, I also like handling contents from the database (When learning node stuff in Colt's course). I feel like making the API's for the backend was interesting.\n* I think i'd like to honestly work in a heavy OO language. I am rusty and need to improve my OO skills, so I think this would be a good motivator to learn them. I enjoy \"structuring\" the program in typical OO fashion if that makes sense. (Deciding how everything will work together)\n* Im ok at linux, but someone mentioned in an earlier thread about working with AWS servers on Linux with C# (or maybe C++) im not sure what this entails but I like the idea of this.\n\nWhat kind jobs would fall under this umbrella? Clearly NOT front-end but back-end. But I guess there is more to back-end than JUST web-dev right? Im not against web-dev but I would really like to be in a more system level programming eventually?  Maybe cloud computing or some sort of data-type field? (data analyst or something?) or something in big data?\n\nSidenote: My GPA wasn't the best in college (around 2.5~). I regret it a lot...but given I have 7 years solid experience in the \"tech world\"....im guessing that's less of an issue? Im not gonna act like it wasn't my fault that I did very mediocre but I think I just had poor work/study ethic back then....now all the jobs i've had i've had always constantly good feedback.\n\nI think im just not sure what I want is called. Does anyone have any ideas?\nThanks!",

I've been blessed enough to get accepted to the 11/27/2017 Javascript Immersive onsite-cohort in SF. I have already reserved my seat. If anyone else reads this and is in the same cohort, feel free to send me a private message to connect beforehand! I'd love to get to know my classmates!\n\nI was wondering if anyone can give me tips to do beforehand, pitfalls to look for during the program, and perhaps things to look out for in getting a job and having a successful experience at HR, I've heard both wonderful and not so wonderful things about HR, about 80/20. I want to increase my chances to have the best 12 week experience of my coding career, with that said,  \n\n* 1) What made you successful in doing Hack Reactor?  \n\n\n* 2) What was your 'end result'? How did the interview process go and when did it seem to 'click' to you and give you confidence that you could go out there and get that 6-figure software engineering job?   \n\n \n* 3) I have less than 90 days before my cohort begins, what can I do beforehand to increase my chances of hitting the ground running from day 1.   \n\n\n* 4) What book/website/knowledge/topics should I seek and nail down hard (aside from basic, 'know how to code/know javascript') prior to the cohort start date?    \n\n\n* 5) I heard that there was a lot of pair programming involved at HR, how was the structure beneficial/not beneficial to you? What are some things to keep in mind if there are bumps in the structure? For example, if I get paired up with someone that's not so good at coding and I would have to pull their weight? Or I'm the one that's not that good and my classmate is pulling my weight?     \n\n\n* 6) What set you apart from other cohort members? What 1 thing did you learn the most from a classmate or a teacher that made the $18k tuition 'worth it'?    \n\n\n* 7) What were some advice you would've told yourself in week 1 by the time you hit week 12?    \n\n\n* 8) If you were to start the whole HR process all over again, what would be the 1 thing you would advise yourself? \n\n   \n* 9) The hours seem pretty crazy 9am-8pm Mon - Sat. How did you adjust to that schedule and what tip would you give in terms of maintaining composure? I am foreseeing that there will be times where I will be overwhelmed, if you encountered that situation, what did you do that helped you get over that hump?     \n\n\n* 10) Finally, aside from the hard work, pain, and struggles, what was the #1 funnest thing you did at Hack Reactor that made you cherish those 12 weeks forever in your coding career!    \n\nThank you all in advanced! Hope to hear some valuable replies/insight on it. And if any HR alum's are on here, I'd love to chat with you if you are open to it !\n\n",

I took the job I am currently in because it had enabled me to travel from my current location back home to visit family during some pretty major things that were going on.\n\n\nThere is a company that has expressed interest in hiring me when my current 6 month contract is done, and I really like the group. However, I am hesitant to go to it in the event that I get extended or FTE, because I do not want to look like a job hopper (though yes, everything so far is contract).\n\n\nMy aforementioned medical issues in no way impact my job, nor would they require any time out of the office for health reasons. They are simply something that has to get dealt with. My current job has no health benefits (though FTE would).\n\n\nBasically, I am afraid that, despite only being in this industry for about two and a half years (at contract completion), I will look like a job hopper. But in your opinion, is this the case, or simply a matter of having been a contractor (once with no possibility to go FTE. Another that I left out of fear of stagnation.

            "selftext": "I'm a senior majoring in Computer Science with a concentration and Web & Mobile Applications. I only have 3 semesters left, including the semester I'm in now.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo, recently I've been contemplating if I even enjoy to program. I created a mobile game this past summer, and I enjoyed that; not the coding part though. What I enjoyed about making making the game was coming up with ideas on what the game mechanics would be like, how the UI should be laid out, etc. I guess you can say the design aspect of it? That got me thinking that maybe I'm in the wrong field because this isn't the first time in my college career in which I questioned my field of choice, CS.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBack in my sophomore year, I started to create AMVs (Anime Music Videos), and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Just to give you an idea, here is one of these best AMVs ever, [Just Funkin' Dandy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhh-0od8VRQ). I haven't edited any AMVs since my sophomore year since it's very time consuming and so is school. I eventually want to get back to it whenever I have enough time.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn my junior year, I rediscovered Magic: The Gathering (MTG), and haven't stopped playing since. MTG is one of the most popular card games in the world, and people can play professionally as their career. The reason why I like my MTG, and why I think about it almost every day, is that I can be creative about the type of decks I can create. There are thousands and thousands of cards to choose from, so creative is far from limited. Sometimes I come of up of crazy ideas for cards that the company (Wizards of the Coast) could make.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe point of my paragraphed stories is that I **LOVE** to create, but I don't like to program at all. I'm okay at programming; enough to get me by, but I don't want to do it on a daily basis. I don't even care to practice my programming skills, but I do anyway so that I won't fall behind in my classes. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nAlso, I recently just got an internship as a Software Developer Intern with a startup company, and it kind of confirmed that I don't care to for programming.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMy **QUESTION** is, what are some career options I can look into? I love to create. I get excited about abstract art, storylines for certain stuff (movies), cooking (another form of creation), cinematography, music, etc.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI know that this question is **SUPER** broad, and has been asked many times, but most of the people who ask this question still want to step into something technical; I don't. The hard part for me is that I'm too close to graduating. Anyway, thanks for reading if you've gotten this far into the post.",

I joined 2 years ago (after grad school) and have been pretty happy. There is a married couple on the team. The female joined before I did, while the male joined a year ago.\n\n* The female engineer likes to bring up very sensitive topics over lunch and she didn't like my comments. My comments were in line with HR requirements but not liked by her. The female engineer was on the same level as me, while her husband is much more senior (this is one of the topics she likes to bring up.) She wasn't able to go for promotion due to some company specific rules, which I sympathize. Then she left the company. \n\n* The male senior engineer and I work along the same path. Since he joined later, I own the most high profile and high revenue project. There is some concern (from at least one teammate) about the senior engineer not performing at his level, but I understand since his projects didn't happen to work out. I can sense from his eyes he wasn't happy that I own such a major project while being 2 levels below him. I also made some \"mistake\" correcting him, which makes him unhappy... \n\n* 6 months ago, I approached the senior engineer for feedback on my promotion. The feedback was mostly negative even though my technical impact is well known among the teams and even the company (I am on a confidential top performer list with extra bonus). Still I was heeding his feedback to help others more. I created a lot of infrastructure stuff and specifically helped the couple on their projects.\n\n* I was a little hesitant when I asked the male engineer for peer reviews. But I think I helped him quite a lot and he would be appreciative. Much to my surprise, he made very negative comments on my promotion. He even said I have diversity issues. I am confused and upset since these comments were not communicated with me earlier when I talked to him right before I went for promotion.\n\nI am utterly confused about what I should do. My biggest fear is that no matter what I do, he will be blocking my further career advancement. The way he provided feedback didn't seem sincere or even constructive. And I feel physically sick being in the same meeting with him. Will my staying on the team be a complete waste of time?\n\nHope you guys can shed light on it! Much appreciated\n\n\n\n\n\n",

For example, if I apply to some companies like Facebook or Google and apply to different positions within their company (i.e. applying to Google, Youtube, and Waymo) for different positions, do I only get to interview for one role at a time? I applied to both Google and Youtube's new grad position and was contacted by one of them, but I'm curious if this means that all other roles that I applied to at these companies will be put on hold. Do companies usually just have one department reach out, and if thats the case, what if  *I* prefer one company over another? And what happens if I ultimately don't get accepted by the division I'm interviewing with, can I ask them to consider me for the other roles I've applied to based on how far I go in the interview process?\n\ntl;dr If I apply to multiple roles at a big company (like Google, Facebook) with many divisions, can I only be considered for one role at a time, or can each division contact me if they're interested in moving forward?\n\nThanks.",

I never planned on working through the school year but it took them so long to hire me that i was just really getting into the it by the time school started. I've been working hard to try and manage my internship, senior project, other classes, and social life. But I feel like everything is suffering because I cant give anything the full attention it deserves.\n\nI've worked for them for 3 months at this point and the amount of value that I perceive it giving me doesn't seem worth it anymore. I do not feel like I'm learning much any more from them; my shifts are generally spent finding random bugs/features to implement without much challenge. So now I've got the experience to talk about and put on my resume and cant help but feel that my time would be better spent really making my senior project shine. At this point the internship just seems like my lowest priority and its not fair to them. Am I underestimating the value of having an extended internship on my resume? Should I just suck it up and slave on?\n\nAt this point I'm really leaning towards quitting but I dont know how to go about it. The office is an open floor plan so telling the one or two people necessary that I'm submitting my two weeks notice seems rather awkward in front of everyone. But sending them a message on slack seems unprofessional. Also, in your opinion do I need to finish out my two weeks?\n\n\nThanks for your time and your feedback everyone.\n\n\n",

            "selftext": "Hello, community! First, let me explain myself.\n\nWho am I: I'm a currently working in ventilation systems engineering, my main area of focus is the autonomous ventilation systems - I'm working with the configurable industrial controllers (Corrigo, etc.) and PLC's (Unitronics), and build the electrical system to power and actuate the mechanical components of ventilation systems (for both standalone systems and system networks). My academic background is MEng in Robotics and Cybertronics.\n\nWhat I'm interested in: Over the last 4 years I've been doing a lot of embedded electronics, the most interesting platforms for me are mBed and Arduino. I've completed multiple complex Arduino projects, throughout the latest one I've designed (both software and hardware) a ventilation system controller on ATSAM3X IC base (uC of Arduino Due). I managed to design and produce professional PCB and enclosure and actually did sell multiple controllers to the clients that were not able to buy an industrial controller.\n\nWeb design: I also do have some experience in web development. I've gained some HTML and CSS experience while I was making websites a while ago (CMS of course).\n\nWhy do I think I need Electron: Firstly, for IoT applications. Recently I came across multiple examples, where people did interesting things with Arduino and ESP8266. Namely, stuff, where ESP8266 is used to create a server, and then the Arduino, is controlling the server by sending simple AT instructions to the access point (ESP8266) and receiving GET requests from the web page. All that's needed is an Arduino, ESP8266, jQuery, and an HTML file. The process is better explained here: http://allaboutee.com/2015/01/02/esp8266-arduino-led-control-from-webpage/ .From what I see, I can use Electron to create a dedicated desktop application for such things (the idea is to have a professional looking desktop application instead of simple HTML file that has to be opened in the browser). The other area of interest is applications involving serial hardware control. The idea is to create applications that will access the serial port of a PC to manipulate the data from microcontrollers, possibly creating interfaces, etc.\n\nPS. I do have the time to invest in javascript learning, and HTML and CSS polishing.\n\nSo, is it worth it?",

If this is not the place, please forgive me.\n\nAbout my situation:  I was a business major.  I'm currently 27.  I'm currently working at an international trade consulting firm and I'm finding it's not for me.  I'm offering \"services\" and \"helping\" companies begin to start selling their products internationally but what we offer is marginally helpful to our clients.\n\nI'm also finding that I'm not enjoying trying to force people to buy or commit to things that they aren't automatically inclined to do.  It doesn't feel right to me and I'm adverse to it.  I'm both a mix of introverted and extroverted, I relate well to others and I've been told I'm likable.  These are a few typical items to do well in the business world but I'm honestly miserable and I don't know if it's a product of the workplace or my natural inclinations.\n\nI do want to be involved in a growing industry.  I want to have job stability. I've taken work placement tests that say I'm a good fit for the software programming world.\n\nHow do I decide if it's worth the additional schooling at 27?  I'm more than willing to put in the time and the effort and maybe even keep my current job while doing so.  I just feel as if I owe it to myself to not be miserable my whole life.\n\nThank you all for any insight you're able to provide!",

Since my time in the office was so short, the company allowed me to continue working with them throughout the semester as a part-time remote employee. Although my contract doesn't state an expected number of hours, I told them verbally that I would shoot for working 20 hours a week. I've been a remote employee for 5 weeks now.\n\nI'm rather worried at the moment because I'm not being productive. Due to classes, I can't attend our sprint planning meetings, and I really underestimated how helpful face-to-face contact with my coworkers and manager was, so I really don't feel like I'm a part of the team. I've only submitted a couple of PRs since I started working remotely, none of which have been merged in yet, and getting clarification on PR feedback can take up to a whole day due to timezone differences (I'm on the east coast, and part of the team is in Europe).\n\nMy manager hasn't outright told me that I'm not being productive yet, but he expressed a little concern over my pace in our last meeting two weeks ago (he was at a conference last week). I have my next meeting with him tomorrow afternoon.\n\nI graduate this semester, and I really want to work for this company after I graduate, but I feel like my pacing is going to lead them to not offer me a full-time job afterward.

There is definitely a reason why they didn't go for the hire although I can't really think of any red flags to be honest with you. Although I'm not a rockstar dev, I'm definitely experienced for a Junior dev out of college. Sure I can explain to them that they just hired two senior developers, and that they didn't need me because I'd be more of a burden for them. Or maybe because they didn't get enough funding to hire me. But those reasons, even if they are true to some degree, will make me look desperate. Let me know what's a good approach to companies asking me why I'm leaving the company. ",

I've learned quite a bit from my internship so far, like basic MySQL commands and about Selenium (the browser automation tool in Python that I use to scrape data). When I joined, 8 states could be scraped by the system; now it's at 35 states.\n\nEven though I'm satisfied with the day to day work, I still feel inadequate; I feel like this internship isn't impressive enough when I'll be talking to companies during career fairs this year. This has been my only relevant experience outside of the classroom (~3.2-3.3 GPA).\n\nShould I be worried that my internship isn't enough to talk about to impress/ talk with companies? Part of me thinks I might be overthinking things and part of me thinks that my one measly internship isn't enough to impress recruiters/companies to land a full time position.\n\nI'm going to a big career fair tomorrow so that's what's making me worried.\n\nThanks in advance for any input!!\n",

I have made more sites than I can count. In 2013 I decided to learn JavaScript to help step into the world of development. I really enjoy working with JavaScript and have been studying and practicing through my own projects, tirelessly. Despite passing my 4yr anniversary of starting this journey I still feel overwhelmed and like I'm never going to be good enough. I've spent probably an average of 2hrs a day studying and applying what I've learned for that 4 year period. \n\n\nI pick up contract gigs as a means to earn a paycheck and gain valuable \"unpredictable\" experience. Meaning I don't decide what I am building but rather I need to create a solution for a client and I never know what challenge I will come across each day. I can pretty much tell you what every method in JavaScript does (with some exceptions) so I am confident in my knowledge of JS, and this whole experience has been great but I find myself struggling to come up with solutions for sometimes even basic problems. Where I stop and wonder how the hell I'm going to solve this where I ultimately Google the problem to find a solution. I see so many memes about copy and pasting from stackoverflow and it's so damn real and it completely destroys my confidence in myself. I feel stupid. My friend with 3mo into a boot camp is solving problems faster than me and with less googling. \n\n\n\nHow do I break through this wall? What is the best way to strengthen and become confident in my skills? I know practicing and writing code is step one, but I feel like despite endless effort and endless client work I'm coming across stuff I've never had to do and because of that I don't even know the first line of code to write to begin. I would greatly appreciate some guidance here. I'm overwhelmed and often consider working in a restaurant for the rest of my life instead because my self doubt and imposter syndrome takes over. I'm generally a confident person, but development has really taken a toll and even has begun to give me anxiety. Has anyone here encountered something similar? How did you personally get past this?

I want to be at a place where I can actually code. I want to be a full stack web dev in the future and this SharePoint route isn't helping.\n\nOne of my friends I made through the bootcamp hooked me up with a job opportunity offering me 15/hr. It will be a fast paced environment and it will be in ASP.NET (C#). I feel like I would learn way more there and I also feel like i can prove how good I am and end up making more after not too long.\n\nRight now I have a lot of money saved up so that's not a problem. What do you guys think? Would you take a pay cut from 22.50/hr to 15/hr to do something you really enjoy? Or would you wait for another opportunity to arise? Problem is if I stay at this SharePoint gig any longer I fear of getting fired for being terrible at this crap lol.",

            "selftext": "Hi,  so I graduated a little over a year ago with a degree in mathematics and statistics from a pretty good university here in the UK.  My degree included a couple of computing modules but these were in R and honestly I can\u2019t really remember the language all that well (I didn\u2019t really enjoy it). Just before my final year I started teaching myself python, purely out of interest and really enjoyed it. I also started earning money online through something you could think of as card counting (earns money gambling, legal, frowned upon by bookies etc, but importantly this is not actual employment). Once I graduated I continued to do this full time while deciding what I wanted to do with my life. Well now I have finally decided, I really enjoy coding, and would like to find a job doing this so how realistic is this and where do I begin? \n\nI have 0 work experience and although I have no issue explaining exactly what it is I did for the last year, it\u2019s difficult to explain and would require an interview to get across, this couldn\u2019t really be put in my cv. I have a degree in maths and stats, not CS, how much does this matter? I don\u2019t know how many languages I know because I don\u2019t know what counts as \u2018knowing\u2019 it, for example I would say I\u2019m most comfortable with python, as I know everything I\u2019ve seen, but with me not learning from a course or whatever I\u2019ve never completed one and therefor can\u2019t say \u2018I\u2019ve completed X python course\u2019. \n\nI\u2019ve used a little JS, HTML, C# and MATLAB and feel like I could pick any of these up pretty quickly, I generally learn fast. I see other people\u2019s CV\u2019s and they have like 10 languages on though so mine would look terrible in comparison. Do I need to learn more languages and if so which? I was thinking java?\n\nMy GitHub has some projects on that I\u2019ve done, but there are a couple not there since they need logins to use. Generally the ones not on there are web scrapers and some scripts that work with API\u2019s and XML feeds. They take this data and put it into a pandas data frame and use various things to analyse it and tell me what to do.\n\nSo what would be a realistic job for me where I code? I\u2019m not looking for huge pay, no exaggeration I would be willing to work for minimum wage if it was a remote job so I could continue the work I am currently doing (it\u2019s not very time consuming since I have wrote scripts to help me so wouldn\u2019t distract me from my job). I just want an entry level coding job for experience and to have consistent money coming in each month (for applying for a mortgage purposes etc). \n\nI\u2019ve been applying for remote software dev jobs (maybe 20-30 so far) but I haven\u2019t heard back from most. I had 1 interview over basically Skype where I shared my screen and spoke to a guy for like 40 minutes. It went well but I didn\u2019t have the experience they needed, he has actually got back to me since though about possible contract work. This is a good sign right?\n\nAny suggestions? Thanks\n\nHere\u2019s my GitHub:\n\nwww.GitHub.com/lukegarbutt",

Not exactly software development (still waiting to see whether I'll get a chance to assist the main team on their industry-specific software suite or not) - more of a sysadmin type. Shameless plug: I got this position through a relative.\n\nOverall, I have about one year to prepare myself before this project is over and I'm back searching for yet another job). The problem is, I can't decide between full stack (with emphasis on backend) web dev and mobile dev. I've read that web dev is getting a whole lot harder to break into, now that almost everyone could quickly whip up their own page using something like Wordpress+plugins. I also haven't browse the Play Store in a long, *long* time, so I don't know if it's still a big mess or not (ie. full of shovelwares and shitty clones). It'd be nice if I could semi-support myself with some apps, but I definitely won't hold my breath for that.\n\nI'd appreciate any advice/resource that would put me on the right path.

In this review I was basically told they didn't know how i was getting on as they didn't check work. I was given 4 objectives to meet in to be reviewed in 3 months time.\n* Learn the product in the clients prospective (we have a support shift that was not in my contract, so why are they adding this to my objectives in the first place)\n* Be proactive with problem solving, aim to solve issues before getting others involved (Again another thing to do with the support shift)\n\n4 months later (today)  I have another review, where i felt they did nothing but compliment me. Couple of small things here and there, agreed I've improved my knowledge of the flow of the product but as i hadn't been assigned work to do with the main product it was difficult to improve this. I am fully expecting to start negotiating how much of a pay rise it would be only to be told in 3 months they will reassess. \"We believe you are now at where we thought you were when we hired you\"\n\nI am on \u00a323k/y. Someone who started 2 months after me just has a inflation rate pay rise (i did not get this) And had a \u00a32k pay rise during the last review as the company had employed new staff who were not as competent on the same salary as him (he started on \u00a320k/y). So he is now on \u00a322.6k/y where as i am still on my \u00a323k/y. I had about 8 months experience prior to coming here so I negotiated a better salary.\n\n\nSorry for the wall of text, also bit of a rant but in summary should I just leave? I feel severely undervalued here. It is a small company with just 14 employees for context.\n\n\nSeeing people on here being told they are undervalued as a graduate at $80+k/y is really depressing...

            "selftext": "I feel like as a new graduate I've had a fairly easy time getting interviews. Unfortunately, I've not had an easy time passing them - most of the \"prestigious\" companies rejected me pretty quick without even giving an onsite.\n\nFortunately I did manage to get an offer from what I would consider an ok company. The salary is quite competitive for my city, but their interviews were fairly easy, the nature of the work does not seem hugely challenging, and I kind of might get bored there. So my plan is stay there for about 3 years to get some money (I am not from a wealthy family at all), while improving myself and then trying again for those companies I failed the interview with as a graduate.\n\nWhat I am curious about is whether it will become harder over time to get an interview at these companies. Yes, on one hand more experience seems like an advantage over a new grad. However, I feel like new grads get interviews more easily because there is more unknown about them. Could be an idiot, could be a genius, could be anything in between. And companies decide it's worth it to interview them in the event of the occasional great programmer among them. Whereas if you failed an interview with them before, got into a much less competitive company, and are now applying again, that sort of makes your apparent skill level more determined, even if you spent the last three years improving yourself (since that isn't visible on your resume).\n\nWhat's your opinion? And if you think it does get more difficult to get interviews later on, do you have any thoughts on how to counter that? Most advice here is for new grads (do projects, internships etc.), does that apply well to this situation or is there something else you should be doing instead? Only additional thing I could come up with is to build your network, which might later lead to a referral.",

Their understanding of bash and Linux was almost nil, and their best coder mainly knew python. The software they need has to be in c++, and I'm pretty good at programming in ROS. I think my skills will be a huge asset to their team, and I can tell they want me.\n\nThey said I'm going to get paid through contact work as well as getting equity. How should I do this?

I have plenty of project experience with Rails, Java, Python (data science and django) and unix, but no verifiable professional experience.\n* learning and using other technologies is important to being a well rounded engineer and truly being able to discern the right solution for any given problem.\n* money maximization is not a justifiable reason to sacrifice having new experiences.\n* I'd really like to end up working at a non-profit or something at least environmentally focused.\n\nThe problem I'm facing is that it seems like most open job positions listed on indeed, or even peeking through the monthly hacker news \"who's hiring\" posts ask for at least a few years with tech I have no professional background in but would love to (Java, Python, PHP, Rails). How do I even get through the mass resume scan process if my background in rails is a year long school project and a github project I slapped together in an afternoon?\n\nShould I try to start smaller first by finding something closer to me to build resume years of experience numbers, or would it be better to get into a different location with a .NET job until I can network and find something closer to what I'm looking for?\n\nMy biggest fear is getting pigeonholed to the point where I can't achieve one or any of my bullet-ed goals or experiences I'd like to have above.\n\nAny and all advice appreciated.",

I decided to switch over to programming when the oil industry crashed here (Calgary). So far, with previous credit I have about 1.5 -2 years left in my degree.\n\nTo be honest, I'm unsure about sticking to school and racking up more debt, going through academia all over again and possibly having a harder time finding work when I graduate. Then again, there's always a huge risk in trying to move through the industry without a CS degree. The company is fast growing (literally quadrupling revenue every year) and I get along quite well with the CTO/Senior Engineer. The pay isn't exactly amazing but it isn't bad for a starting salary with no prior experience either (~40k CAD).\n\nI was hoping to get advice from people who might have had a similar situation?",

            "selftext": "Three months ago I started a new job as a jr. developer for a small consulting company that works mostly for health insurance companies. I took the job because it was a big pay increase ($40->$55k) from my last job, which I didn't dig and felt desperate to get out of. However, I think I jumped the gun too quickly and really don't dig the new job either.\n\n- The company of only 60 people is full of nepotism. The CEO's wife is the majority owner and his three kids work here, and many of the other employees are personal friends/ex-coworkers, alumni, etc of the other employees. It makes me uncomfortable because I did not know the company was like this, and I feel like I am one of the only people who works there who isn't somehow connected to the owner. To my left, the bosses' son's friend. To my right, the bosses' son. WTF.\n\n- The commute kind of sucks. It usually takes me 45 minutes to an hour to get home after battling the elevator, long walk to the parking garage, congested city traffic, etc. I know to some people this is normal, but I am used to 20 minute commutes, and this particular city sucks and is not even a nice place to hang out in.\n\n- I have no synergy with my co-workers. There are only a few people on the same project as me, and they are doing entirely different things (I am mostly doing sql crystal reports and maintaining a legacy system, they are developing a new platform). I have tried my best to be friendly, start conversations asking about them and how they are doing, and build rapport with any devs that I can, but all of them seem very disinterested in being friendly or offering any help/guidance. It's like a weird clique that I can't break into. My invitations to their D&D night or even walks to pick up lunch get lost in the mail it seems. Really, I feel almost no effort by anyone to get to know me and make me feel part of the team. I don't really care because I don't need to be friends with my co-workers, but this amounts to me barely talking to anyone for most of the day. Basically, I feel very much as an \"outsider' culturally and there is not really even much I can do to change that because there aren't even that many opportunities to socialize with the other developers, and my efforts so far have been met with very lukewarm, disinterested response.\n\n- My direct supervisor is always busy or working from home and not reachable, and the senior dev that would be my biggest resource (I work on the system he made) acts like I am a complete idiot annoyance when I ask him anything, even though I only even brace myself to do that when I literally have no other option (usually it's something I don't have access to). Both are overworked but at the same time don't even seem to acknowledge that maybe they should try and integrate the new employee a bit. I do have a \"career mentor\" assigned to me, but he has nothing to do with my actual project or anything technical; he seems more like a risk elevator to spy on me for HR, more than anything.\n\n- We don't even have assigned desks and have the awful open office to the extreme feel (even conference rooms are all glass). I am usually not even sitting near any developers because 80% of the company are business people working on other projects. So I feel extremely isolated, with no team feeling, yet while also being in a loud environment surrounded by people. So I get all of the garbage of the modern open office design with almost none of the benefit of being able to openly ask other developers for input or even hear what they are working on. I could skype people, I guess, but it would be awkward and essentially asking random people not on my project to stop doing their work and look at mine.\n\n- I realize that I don't really dig consulting work because it is the constant struggle of a project manager who has no idea how long anything I do actually takes, telling me I should have those things done in much shorter time periods. I feel I would much rather work internally for a company where it is more about getting done what needs to get done then forcing projects into made up budget hours.\n\nOther than that the work isn't HORRIBLE since I do like writing sql reports, and these are getting pretty advanced and challenging (in a good way. And I don't have to work crazy hours (at least so far). But mainly, it just doesn't feel like a place I can call home.\n\nSo anyway, I just interviewed at a company that I think would be a much better fit for a similar position. The company is a lot bigger (1,000 employees, fortune 500 engineering company), with a shorter commute, similar tech stack that I like, and one of my friends works in the same department, so I would at least have someone interested in talking to me there. I am pretty certain I can expect an offer soon from what my insider friend has told me.\n\nBut I am stressing that my switching jobs I am screwing up my career hard. This wouldn't be my only short term job since my last two jobs were one place I was at for only 4 months when I found out that they were expecting 60+ hour weeks on my meager $40k/year salary, and another that I was only at for 1 year because I didn't like being temporary employee status when I had been there an entire year.\n\nSo reddit, how much am I fucking up my career and how shitty is my attitude?",

The math and physics courses required for the major make me feel like I'm gonna be spending all my time studying. Even Calc 1 has been pretty hard. \n\nI'm pretty good at programming, I've made three iOS apps, got a 5 on the AP test, and came in first place in an app competition sponsored by Google in NYC. However, my other academics aren't that good compared to everyone else in Engineering.\n\nPenn State has a major called Information Systems: Design and Development (ISDEV). [Here is the ISDEV Academic Plan](https://ist.psu.edu/students/undergrad/majors/istbs/isdev/plans)\n\nThis seems much easier than the [CS Academic Plan](http://www.eecs.psu.edu/students/undergraduate/Computer-Science.aspx) and looks to have more of an emphasis on actual programming.\n\nSo basically my question is: if I do end up switching to this, how will it affect me once I graduate? Will most companies just ignore my app if they see that I didn't get an actual CS degree?\n\nI'm gonna try to power through my courses now but if I start getting Cs then I might have to switch since the CS GPA requirement is like a 3.2\n\nThanks",

Hope you don't mind.\n\nI'm currently a CS Major in my senior year of college, and I'm above a 3.0 at the moment. But while I'm pretty good with understanding theory, my work ethic is kinda terrible, and I think that part of my decent grades was from lucking out in terms of teammates. And after a stint doing part time app development work, I realized I don't really enjoy development, and I didn't get as far with the app I was working on as I would've liked. Also, I do digital artwork as a hobby, but I'm finding that it's eating up an increasingly large chunk of my free time, I enjoy doing it a lot, and I think I could eventually probably make money off of it if I keep developing my skills and growing my following. Obviously, this kinda presents a problem with parental expectations. (Disclaimer: They pay the chunk of my tuition that scholarships don't cover)\n\nNow, I don't want to drop out of college or go penniless just to pursue my passion. I want to stay afloat, at least for awhile. While I think I can probably graduate college with around the same grades I currently have, that one bad experience with development does make me wonder if I can actually be able to stay at a company doing developmental work for at least a year without being fired.

I am now in my first fall semester. Odds are good I can complete this program in 2 years. I commute to this school to mitigate costs. This particular college only has a CIS program, which is what i'm currently in. The problem is that I am starting to get cold feet with the program after noticing some red flags, (only one professor teaching every single class, job postings online for an assistant professor go unfilled, even in the middle of a semester, the major only has less than 100 kids in it, professor having to cancel classes for the semester because no one was enrolled in them, also telling kids that if they make it to the junior level and senior level classes, it will most likely be 'independent study' classes) so I've been thinking of transferring in the spring semester to a university that offers a CS program. The only problem with this is that I would most definitely be shooting myself in the foot in terms of cost, as I would be going from around 27,800 dollars (13k in my name, rest in my parents) in student loans for both years of my undergraduate studies at my current college to a 23,000/year cost of attendance at the college that offers the CS major. I didn't receive any financial aid the first time I applied to the CS college when first considering where I should transfer after my associates, so I assume I won't be getting any this time around either. Let's assume I will be taking on the entirety of the cost of attendance, though I know no one usually pays sticker price. That's 46,000 for my undergraduate, right? Well, as it turns out, the CS program's junior and senior level classes all depend on the first 2 principles of computer sciences classes, (ITEC 120 and ITEC 220), meaning that since both of these classes, as well as a first year programming intro class that must be taken a semester before ITEC 120 can even be taken, means that it will be impossible for me to graduate in 2 years. I've crunched the schedule for awhile, and it's looking like that I will need 3 years in total to complete the CS program. I wouldn't be commuting to this college, so I would be taking on the full cost of attendance of room and board as well as tuition. That's 69,000 sticker price for the CS program. I would obviously be working through college to help mitigate debt, but i'm having a hard time justifying my switching my program due to costs. \n\nI personally enjoy the broad spectrum of technology that my CIS program encompasses, but I feel as if I would be missing out on vital development and programming classes, as well as math classes that I would have a harder time learning on my own if I ever decided to go down the programming path. I've seen CIS constantly get snubbed by CS majors as inferior, and that I obviously should have picked CS, as CS majors can do everything that a CIS major can, yet a CIS major can't do most of anything a CS major can. Is it worth trudging through a subpar college program just because it is significantly less costly? Should switching majors to CS be justified? Could I simply just teach myself the parts of CS I missed out on while I pursue CIS and be perfectly fine and save myself money in the long run? Maybe it's too soon to judge a program in its first semester? Has anyone been in a situation like mine before?\n\nI'm at a loss and really seeking any guidance or input. Anything, even the slightest thought, would help me out.",

After high school, I didn't pursue any higher education and have been basically consulting/working remotely. \n\nAround early 2014, I submitted my resume to a recruiter (was low on clients/work) and forgot about it as they never got back to me. Last week I get an email from them asking for a phone interview. I wasn't expecting anything and I didn't even read the job description thoroughly except for the main title 'iOS Developer' and i just replied back with a time for phone interview along with my resume(which is just full of clients/apps I've worked for, no education section at all) just to test the waters. \n\nI passed the ph. interview and now they are looking for an in-person interview. They are offering me 90k + bonus. It's one of the big companies in Canada (it's a household name here but don't really want to name them). \n\n**The problem**\nSo after the interview, I read the job description (yes i know...like I said I don't do this often) and everything is fine, I'm experienced with/comply with every requirement except for one: a degree in comp sci/soft. eng. or similar field. \n\nNow I've never had a proper 9-5 and I'm not worried about the interview except for one thing: What if during the interview they ask about my education? I'm not sure how to answer that.\n\nI've developed 40+ apps in last 6-7 years. I'm not saying I'm very experienced of course not, but I do feel like i'm much farther ahead in terms of experience than the average college kid who just graduated CS. But I've got this complex that I don't have a degree and it's going to kill me if they reject me just because of that.\n\n\n**Question**\nI guess my question is: Should I just let them know now? Or first thing during the interview and clear it out of the way? Or just hope they don't ask me? What if they get angry at me saying I wasted their time when the job spec clearly stated I need a degree?\n\nIs / was anyone else in this situation? Please share!",

Also been almost a year since I graduated, tho I didn't have much in the way of instructions on the languages I have to work with (HTML, PHP, CSS and Javascript - none at all on those last two), and could have been a better student when it came to the one they focused on (Java).\n\n\nI started with little to no experience, just what I got from an online course. Thing is, as time passed I grew more comfortable with HTML and CSS codes, throwing the bare-minimum PHP and a bit JS to help with effects and plugins. As things are now I can get a layout done fast enough, but I struggle with plugins a LOT more than I wanted... I feel I should have the hang of it by now, it's always the same ones (carousel, sliders). Also, my boss being a person that focuses more on getting things done than the actual process of making them, is someone who rarely can be of help with more complicated stuff, as if he doesn't know much about the stuff we work with either (we are the only developers of the agency for now). I had to implement a login system for an application in Laravel a few weeks back, and he provided no help other than \"look it up online\". Not being able to get it done on my own, he said we could have a look at it later. \n\n\nSo I feel like I need to step my game up, but I don't know what to do:\n\n* I need to get better at PHP and JS so I can go full-stack (It has been said that I should go full-stack, but not exactly how), but I don't know if I should focus on JS (what everyone seems to like) or PHP (what my boss likes)... or some third option that I don't know about;\n\n* I also should study some database stuff at some point, other than the back-end coding, but don't know where to start... I just don't remember much from what I got in college;\n\n* Some stuff from other areas should be nice too, software development, mobile applications, but it seems like it's just not going to happen at this rate (I know it's doable, just doesn't look like it from where I stand);\n\n* Is it actually any help trying to invest in something other than web-development, or is it better to just focus on this area? \n\n\nThank you all in advance, hope you have a nice week.\n\n",

First, I'll provide some breif background on myself and by job: \n\n* I have a Masters Degree in CS from a university in the United States. I graduated with this degree in May and have been working at my current company since then.\n\n* The company I work for is a well known (in name), mid sized, international retailer. I am really happy with where I work; I like the company and the people.\n\n* My role at my company is **Database Administrator**. I believe that I am adjusting to the role well and I am certainly learning a lot. All of my feedback has been great and I know that my managers think highly of my work, so far.  \n\n**So what's the problem?** I was not hired on as a DBA, I was hired on as a Software Engineer. In fact, in the HR systems, my title is still listed as \"Software Engineer\".\n\n**So why are you a DBA now?** After a couple of days at work, I was asked by my manager about my database experience. Having had lots of academic work in DBs (it was my Master's research area) and an internship that included things DBAs do. They asked if I would be able to fill a need they had at the DBA role and I accepted.\n\nI still have the itch to write code and I think I may want to be a full time developer one day. \n\n**My Questions**:\n\n* Should I be concerned about my future ability to gain a developer job? (I'm guessing this is \"YES\" but just looking for a confirmation)\n\n* If I want to protect my ability to do development in the future, should I ask about picking up some light programming work, like small bug fixes? Maybe consisting of ~4 hours a week?\n\n* BLS.gov rates the salary expectations for developers and DBAs to be about the same. Job outlook gives a slight edge to the DBA role. What do **you** think about this? Mostly interested in earning potential, honestly.\n\n* How do employers view the DBA role as opposed to that of a developer? Does either role lend itself to more (different) career opportunities?\n\nThanks for taking the time to read and reply! :)\n\n^Mods ^tag ^as ^appropriate ",

            "selftext": "I am currently a senior studying CS at a top CS program in the US, and will be graduating this December. I am struggling to decide between two offers I've gotten, and would like some insight and advice on how to decide between the two.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Company:** AT&T\n\n**Industry:** Telecommunications\n\n**Offer:** $75,000\n\n**Location:** Chicago, IL\n\n**Bonus:** $3,000 pre-tax, paid out within first 30 days of employment\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI was an intern at AT&T last summer where I worked on primarily web development and some database applications. They have a \"technology development program\" where you work on a team for 18 months and then decide if you want to stay on that team or join a new team for a more permanent position. The work I did wasn't too interesting, but as an intern I didn't really expect them to give us any super new or exciting tech to work with. Also, a lot of the people I had to interact with were either working remotely or located in cities across the country, and there wasn't many people locally who were on the same team as me. I did made a lot of good networking connections with my manager, other full time developers, mentors, and clients. The company has an office building in Chicago, but its HQ is actually located in Dallas, and I've heard that a lot of the new and more interesting tech to work on within this company usually happens in Dallas. \n\n\nThe perk of working here would be that I could live at home in the Chicago suburbs for a while (preferably no more than 6-8 months I'm thinking) and commute to work by train, which is what I did over the summer. The commute is about an hour long, though. But with the option of living at home, I would be able to save up a lot of money fast which could help a lot for when I decide to buy a home or invest in my financial future, and the idea of not having to worry about rent or relocation is a big plus. I already have a good idea on the kind of work I'd be doing here, and it seems to be pretty similar to the work I did over the summer, and I would be working with the same people under the same manager.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Company:** Target\n\n**Industry:** Retail/Ecommerce\n\n**Offer:** $74,000\n\n**Location:** Minneapolis, MN\n\n**Bonus:** $3,000 post-tax, paid out at least one month before start of employment\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTarget also has a \"technology development program\", but within this program I would have basically two rotations of roughly 4-6 months each, and I get to choose which team/department I want to have my rotations in. After the rotations, you can pick which one you want to work with the most (or choose a brand new one too) and join that team for a more permanent position. The really cool perk of Target is that they are trying to integrate a lot more newer technologies and are willing to put even new hires into teams of their choice. For me personally, I really like the whole VR/AR scene and I spoke with an engineer working with that technology and it seems like a really cool project they're working on and one that I would be able to be a part of. With both companies, I think it's equally easy to change teams even after the end of the program if there is another team you'd rather work for. The company flew me out to their headquarters in Minneapolis and I really enjoyed going through the different buildings they have downtown and talking with the engineers, and overall I really enjoyed how big of a presence this company has in the city and the culture/environment of both the company and the city itself. \n\nThe offer I got from Target is pretty much the same as AT&T, but I'd have to relocate to Minneapolis (they also are giving me a relocation bonus that I'd be able to use before starting) which is far from my family and also isn't a very tech-based city. This also leaves me with a lot less room to save money, since I'd have to worry about living on my own, rent, food, and all the other expenses of moving into a new city. But if I were to move out here, I would get an apartment downtown and would have a very short commute to work. I also feel like the work I'd be doing here could possibly be more interesting, especially since they seem to be very big on utilizing the latest technology.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhat should I be primarily focused on when deciding between these two very similar offers? What should I be considering short term and long term between these two opportunities? This is a major life decision and I only have two weeks to respond to both companies, and I just have no idea where to even begin.",

Unfortunately, none of the [available programs](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxMmLC_xSTYiQUVTa3FuZHNyZkpCcFlqbVpFUWpLTlhyeGJZ/view?usp=sharing) seem to be related to Computer Science.\n\nLooking over the offerings, my thought is the generic \"Associate of Arts\" would be the best available option for transferring to a four year university.  I imagine the degree would satisfy a lot of general education requirements that traditional students would be taking in the first two years before starting in on their Computer Science major.\n\nI've reached out to my in-state universities to inquire about how this would transfer, and while they are trying to be helpful, the community college is one they are not familiar with (I live in WA, and the school is in Ohio).  The bottom line is they'll have to see how each course transfers individually, likely by comparing syllabi.\n\nMy question for you, fine redditors of r/cscareerquiestions:\n\n* Do any of you have recent experience transferring a general Associate of Arts degree to a university to complete your BS in Computer Science?  How do you feel it prepared you?  Was there any trouble going from an \"Arts\" degree to a Science degree?\n\nThank you for your thoughts!",

            "selftext": "Hi all, \n\nI am a 23 year old software developer who has always loved the North American culture compared to England's, and would relish the chance to live and work there. I know USA and Canada are different and within both, the average lifestyle varies significantly between states/provinces. But too be honest, I think I would just need a decent sized city so I have people to meet. For example, it could be New York, Vancouver, Toronto, Denver, Dallas, Phoenix, Orlando, or Calgary, etc....\n\nAbout me: I have a first class honours degree at a UK top ten University in IT Management for Business. And I have a total of around 2 and half years of full time experience working as a full stack software developer, for two different companies. The tech I have mainly worked with at these jobs has been the MS .NET stack (I even passed an official MS exam a couple of months ago), but I enjoy any kind of dev (Java, Python, Swift). In terms of personal projects, I have an app on the app store, but I would say this is my weakness and I am working on it.\n\nSo, I guess my question is, how do I make my American/Canadian dream a reality? From what I have read, in order to get a working visa, I need a job so that a company can sponsor the visa. Which is obvious and makes sense, and I can attempt to do that through online US/Canadian job websites. \n\nBut does that mean I need to be an outstanding top-1% software developer genius in order to get a company to pay extra to hire me over someone who doesn't need a visa? Although I am not a coding genius, I still have confidence in my ability to be able to bring value to whatever company I work for. And I also feel like I have impressive qualifications and a decent amount of real work experience for my age. So if what I have right now isn't good enough yet, I can accept that. But then my next question is, what is good enough? What level of qualifications / experience do I need? I get that more is better, but it would be useful to get an idea of how attractive I need to be as a software developer to make getting a job in North America, as a software developer (requiring a work visa), realistic.\n\nAnd a couple of minor questions: Is either Canada or the US an easy option for me to focus on? Because I genuinely think it would be awesome to live in either country so I don't mind which one. Also, are there any easiest paths to achieving my dream which I'm not thinking of?\n\nThanks a lot for taking the time to read my post, and if you have any questions, please ask. Any advice would be appreciated, thank you.",

            "selftext": "So I just graduated in May with my B.S. in Computer Science, and had a job already lined up that was offered to me in November. However, due to poor financial performance, they rescinded all offers they made during finals week.\n\nSo I started looking again and found a job in the Hartford, CT area. Things were going pretty well for a while. I was brought on full-time originally to help with a specific project, and I even created an internal tool for them. However, last week, I was laid off without warning (during what I'm guessing was a mass lay off, as they mentioned other lay offs the day before, which was my birthday). They told me it was because the company was undergoing a \"realignment\" (whatever that means). I should have seen this coming considering just a month ago, the old CEO retired and a new one came on board, and we just reached the end of the project I was originally brought on to assist with. I have since seen reviews pop up on Glassdoor suggesting this is not the first time they have brought on a batch of new hires and laid them off a few months later.\n\nPerfect timing considering I just moved to the area to be closer to the job and my girlfriend moved in with me. Now we're both jobless and I'm not sure what to do. The problem is that Hartford, CT is very heavy in the insurance software business, which is what I was working in.\n\nI had previously been looking in the Boston, MA area, but came here for this job because I was running out of money and needed to take the job. I would love to be able to look in the Boston area again, but I signed a 1-year lease, so I'm sort of trapped here until I either go broke and become homeless or reach the end of the lease.\n\nSo far, the available jobs I've seen in the area don't look good. There's a lot of full stack jobs, but I have no real experience in web development and am generally disinterested in it. The other jobs all require 5+ years experience (which normally, if the tech stack fell under my expertise, I would ignore) or have a massive tech stack, most of which I know nothing about.\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions about how to get back on the horse and find something before I run out of money?",

I plan to take a 4 years undergrad bachelor degree, after which I'll take up MD-PhD degree in a graduate medical school. However, there is a chance my application to medical school won't succeed as it's highly competitive. I'll then rely on my bachelor's degree to find a job and this is where the dilemma kicks in.\n\nCurrently, I've accepted computer science as my intended major. Reason so is due to the high demand and salary for computer scientists, and comp sci is something I developed an interest in, especially in the area of AI. I also feel that it will be something I wouldn't be bad at due to my strong standing in math and logical thinking. \n\nHowever, upon further reflection I realised I have a real strong passion in biology and medicine. I also don't foresee myself being comfortable with sitting in front of a computer 8-5 everyday. Thus, I'm thinking of changing my major to computational biology as the modules offered come from both comp and life sciences.\n\nThe dilemma comes in here, as I'm unsure whether majoring in computational biology would be helpful. I believe the comp sci(machine learning)/data analytics background of comp bio will aid me in landing a job in the market, but my concern is competing with those who major in comp sci or data analytics, and that I'll lose out to them. A career in research is possible, but the relatively low paying nature of research jobs in S'pore compared to comp sci/data analytics natured careers (as far as I've heard) and the need to obtain a Master's or PhD to ascend puts me off. (Yes I know the contradiction as to why I'm willing to further my studies for a MD-PhD but not for this. The medical sciences is a very huge interest for me and being a physician scientist is not just limited to research but also encompasses the role of a physician. That's why I'm willing to sacrifice a few more years for the much greater rate of return)\n\nTherefore, should I stick with computer science or change to computational biology?",

(I take my prescription at night.) As it stands now I am a successful student, and a successful employee at my current job that unfortunately has some low capped weekly hours due to institutional policies along with being at minimum wage. \n\nI am nervous as I already see plenty of people post things such as putting out 500 applications with no replies, or not finding employment for over the year and having issues even keeping themselves housed and fed.\n\nI'm terrified of being swallowed up by student loans, and scared of having to stop taking my prescription for months at a time and relying on other medications that have given me some rather rough side effects.\n\nHow should I go about finding internships/jobs in my shoes? Switch medications until I get the job and deal with the ill effects? Disclose it once a drug test is mentioned and risk losing the offer? Fake the test and risk what ever penalties I may get if caught?\n\nI'll admit, I should have done more research into what legistration was currently in place for my state before looking into this option of treatment but.. well nothing else has worked, and this has. I don't think protection during the interview process will be protected by state law anytime soon. Maybe I just need to be told to deal with my conditions because that's the way it is currently.

The problem I have always found though is motivating myself after coming from work everyday to continue working on any project for that matter. \n\nYesterday however, I ran into Udacity's full stack web development nano degree. Coincidentally, the course is in Python, the same language that I am using to build my project in. And while the course is kinda expensive but I can totally afford it. Plus the lineup of projects that they mentioned seem intense enough for them being worth the money, I think. \n\nI just wanted opinion from people who have taken that nanodegree course(or any other Udacity course for that matter) as to is it worth investing time into. The way things work with me is that I tend to commit to a project better if I have invested something into it(money in this case), the motivation to stick in that case is usually higher. \n\nCould also use some other opinions/ideas for making a move from one kind of role to another.

Usually I get automatically screened out from larger companies (I'm talking a rejection email in 30 seconds).\n\nHere's my resume: https://imgur.com/QMrTU9h\n\nI imagine the biggest critique will be my lack of projects.

I have no firm offers from any of them yet, but am pretty confident in my interviewing skills and knowledge to get at least a few offers.\n\nSo here's my question - if you know if all companies give you an offer and you have a definite last choice, do you still go through with the interview with that one and let them do the ~$1000 process of flying you out and putting you in a hotel, etc, or is that unethical at that point (in your opinion)? I realize I might not get other offers so it's in my best interest to do so but I guess it makes me feel bad... thoughts?\n\nE: Thanks everyone, good points.

The interview consisted of 4 rounds - 3 technical conversations and 1 behavioural. I'm pretty sure that the technical part was ok, but now when I look back I think I messed up with a behavioural part. I was quite exhausted after first 3 rounds, so my brain didn't work that well during the last one. The reason why I'm worrying is that I think that I might have left the impression of a bold, persistent and task-oriented person who doesn't really care about people that much. The week has passed already and a recruiter didn't respond to my email about status update. Is there any way to fix this? Should I perhaps send an email explaining that I really care about a team and people, and that I can adjust and adopt to whatever environment they have? Or should I just let it go and forget about it? I want this job badly, this's never happened to me before. Thanks in advance.\n",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone ! As mentionned in the title, I just finished my Master's in Marketing. I would like to get a data analyst job (in the filed of Marketing) and I am thinking of taking about 2 months to learn a new language before actively looking for job opportunities (I'm at my parents' so I can take some time for me). I did two 6-months interships in Market Research and I did analyze data even though I did not run the analysis by myself.\n\n\nThe issue is: the only tool I know to do data analysis for the moment is SPSS ibm software (which I learned at uni) which I can use for t-tests, clustering, ANOVA and few other things. Now I know the BASIC function of SQL (select/from/where/groupby) but it is not enough to get a job in the field. Also I feel like SQL is not great to actually analyze the data and compute ratios for example (but maybe I am wrong ?).\n\n\nI had a job interview last week for a junior data analyst position and was given an exercise which consisted of analyzing a database and evaluating the impact of a promotion campaign. Although I found the exercise to be quite easy in theory, I realized that SPSS isn't exactly the best tool for this kind of exercises and that I should look into new methods. The recruiter asked me if I could do the analysis through Python / R / SQL which I can't for instance. After doing some research, I came to the conclusion that I should learn Python and how to use the Pandas library.\n\n\nSo here are my questions:\n\n* Do you think that learning Python / Pandas is the right choice (or maybe I should look more into SQL tools)? It would be my first language, although I had introduction classes to HTML CSS and SQL in the past\n* If so, should I start with \"general\" Python tutorial or go straight for Pandas tutorial ? \n* Do you think two months of following tutorials is enough to have a enough knowledge to do simple analysis ? \n* Last one but I'd say it's the most important: do you think it is realistic to aim at such positions without a more comprehensive knowledge of programming ?\n\n\nThank you for reading, fellow redditors :)",

I have been working through an online Web Dev code \"camp\" for about 9 months now and have gotten to the point where I am fairly good with Ruby. Also taking a C++ class at the local JC. ( And for whatever it's worth, I've completed CodeAcademy's HTML, CSS, and SQL crash-courses). I know I'm certainly not yet at the level where I would qualify for a \"full stack developer\" position, but I would like to think that I know enough where I might be useful to someone somewhere. I'm just trying to figure out where a good place to start would be. What kinds of job titles could I be scoping out and targeting? Ideally I'd like to find something where I'm dealing with code daily so as to complement my learning. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Oh, and I live within commutable distance to SF if that matters. Thanks!",

The post-bac program is just the core CS courses from the BS program. So I've taken OOP, data structures, algorithms, low-level programming and machine organization, all that good stuff. I also have a pretty good amount of web development experience from a part-time student job I have working with a local startup.\n\nI'm starting to look for a full-time job, and am having trouble getting callbacks.  Out of the maybe 100 job applications I've submitted so far, I've received 4 callbacks, all from external recruiters, and only 2 of which were actually regarding the job I applied for.  I feel like there's some problem here - most likely my lack of a CS degree, and I'm trying to work past that.  Usually I get automatically screened out from larger companies (I'm talking a rejection email in 30 seconds).\n\nHere's my resume: https://imgur.com/QMrTU9h\n\nI imagine the biggest critique will be my lack of projects.  My work contributions are all private, and my class projects seem too standard to bother putting on my resume.  I'm pretty tied up with work and class at the moment, so it's hard thinking of anything impressive I could do just to show off on my resume.

I do enhancements, updates, bug fixes, etc to these applications as needed. All these applications are owned by one large client. I am one of two front-end developers that works on these applications.\n\nEach application has its own project manager who will request work to be done from the appropriate developers. We will be given a deadline to get it done (rarely do we get to do the estimates on work for some reason) and often this deadline includes initial development and bug testing etc. Basically the deadline before these changes go to production. I get the impression that these deadlines are set by the client  and the project managers have little say on when things can be done.\n\nThere is a big issue with our team getting deadlines that are much too tight were we are basically bug testing often less than a week before something needs to be going to production. Often we are bug testing and making fixes hours before the changes are going to be pushed to production. This team has seem to operate this way for years.\n\nThings have been steadily getting worse in the fact that several applications need changes, bug fixes, etc all at the same time and all with very short deadlines often where a bug needs to be fixed, tested and deployed in less than a work week. I have had some days lately where bugs were discovered the day changes needed to go to production and we were expected to have them fixed and working by that afternoon.\n\nThis work is on top of my mountain of regular updates on two other applications that I am expected to do. I can't get it all done. Something has to give deadline-wise. My boss who oversees the whole team tries to help me priorities the tasks, but they don't do anything about all this \"last-second we need to get this fixed right now\" situations that we always have.\n\nI am not sure what I can do about this situation since it isn't a temporary thing. It has been this way with the client for years. The client is so large that I think the team doesn't dare tell them that their deadlines are unreasonable.\n\nHow would you guys approach this work environment? I have tried talking to my boss about the fact that I can't get all of this work done at the same time only to be met with the response of \"what can we do to make sure it does get done?\".\n\nTL;DR: my team has a workflow of not giving enough time to get the work done, then fixing everything the day or two before the changes are going to be pushed into production. I am being asked to do more work than I can possibly get done by the deadlines that are all around the same time. This type of workflow has been the norm with this team for years. How do I go about improving my situation?\n\n",

Before that I was in general IT. Anyways I learned the Apex product pretty fast and impressed the senior guy. When he left over disagreement with a new PM, he asked me to join the contract about 6 months later (2016). The money was nice so I made the decision to leave my old company for the new job doing apex configuration. I left on good terms i believe. Anyways, I worked the contract for 1.5 years now and it is ending. I've kept in touch with coworkers at the old company and one of which is now the PM for the old project and he asked me to come back. More Apex stuff but it looks like they are trying to move the existing site/data to a new oracle product (and more popular and lots more jobs). So I definitely am interested. Besides maintaining the oracle customization and configuration, I develop  several c# desktop application and enjoyed working on them. They are a source of pride cause I made it myself from scratch. I fell like i have 2 years of c# development experience.\n\nTo get to the gist of it, I only enjoy coding desktop app and console app to take care of small automation. I don't really enjoy developing web application that seems to be the only job available in the market. Is there anything I can do to branch out to similar roles with other languages?\n\nI feel so defeated and anxious since I've been job searching that I might just go back.I feel like I should also take the offer to join my old company and work to learn something new on the side (there is a lot of downtime in the office).\n\nTlDr? I like building C# desktop app that automates simple process, I don't like building webapps. Are there similar position with other language in the CS field? Should I go back to my old company for a year and learn the new language/do open source project with it to pad resume?",

            "selftext": "The views on it are fairly diverse and I frankly could never find any one place that shares a standard view of it. I'm curious what the spread of opinions around these parts is; I've noticed that this sub in particular tends to be a wee bit more critical with regards to that process than most. And to be clear, by \"technical interview\" I mean the whole process of asking individuals a series of questions about the fundamentals of CS, algorithms, or coding on the whiteboard.\n\nMy own opinion? It's not a good way to recruit and one I think should never be used. Endless false positives, false negatives, and poor correlation between merit as an employee and technical interview performance.\n\nFor mid-level/senior-level professionals, the reason should be fairly obvious; algorithms learned back in college play a very small role in their overall job and while they absolutely know enough to know when and how they should go back and learn an algorithm or set of algorithms as needed, it is a pointless exercise to have them try to regurgitate low-level tasks as if they took that class just a little while ago. [Like this](http://www.unlimitednovelty.com/2011/12/can-you-solve-this-problem-for-me-on.html).\n\nFor entry-level professionals, it's just as bad although not for as obvious of reasons. It really serves as little more than a pop quiz of whatever information you might have been expected to learn over the past four years. Any range of awkwardness of questions being asked or being unable to recall within a small period of time and no resources to reference a specific \"clever\" solution to a problem is the most common thing in the world but also likely to disqualify you from employment for that specific position.\n\nWorst of all though, is that it seems to devalue any form of experience. Any interview or interaction I've ever had with Big X companies (make X as small or large as you like and the number will still be fairly valid), has gone something like this:\n\n\"Tell me about yourself and what you've done.\"\n\n\"I've worked on so-and-so project, accomplished so-and-so in the process.\"\n\n\"Ok I don't really care, here's our little puzzle for you to solve and if you can do it you'll get a job.\"\n\nAnd in that situation, being able to solve their little puzzle, often by studying the exact kinds of questions they ask (I've even seen websites that have full lists of the questions they tend to ask, or seen lazy entry-level engineer interviewers that just rip from CTCI because that's all they know how to do), matters more than actually having a history of being productive. \n\nI've seen it too often justified as a necessary screening check to get rid of all those people that \"can't code at all\" even though they have a degree - or because of not having one at all. But anecdotally I see little to no truth to this. The places I've worked where it's always purely behavioral/resume interviews tend to have programmers suited to the task and to the market rate that they are offered, and rarely is there a blatant lack of coding prowess that is holding them back. And I haven't seen any particular overwhelming concentration of talented programmers at \"technical interview\" firms either. In all cases the people that seem to do the best work are the people who do the best work. There's not really any very simple pattern to establish here. Couple that with the fact that one of the best technical interviewers I ever knew is this guy who is a serial liar (with fake references for every job) who gets fired every few months for incompetence and goes and finds a new job pretty much instantly because he can solve a few coding puzzles, and I wonder if there is any merit at all to using it as a filter.\n\nFrankly, the only factors I can say that are most strongly associated with technical interview prowess are an attraction to competitive coding (leetcode, hackerrank, etc), male youth, and techbro personalities. Most other factors seem to be almost incidental and while most people like to say they've never had bad experiences with a hire they screened through the technical interview process, I really start to wonder if it's causal or even true. I have certainly seen nothing of the sort myself.\n\nKnowing that lots of people see it lots of different ways, I'm interested in seeing what the rest of you have to say about it all.",

            "selftext": "I'm 30 years old and have worked nothing but soul-crushing jobs so far. I'm now at a crossroads and am trying to decide on a career path. I've always enjoyed computers and initially went to school for information systems, but dropped out quickly, then enrolled at a community college to quickly get an associate's degree in programming. For some strange reason, I didn't work very hard to get a job right away when I first graduated back in 2013. I guess it was sort of like I was postponing adulthood or something... I don't know.... I just moved back home when that happened, and always thought I wouldn't be able to find a job in that field in the small area I had grown up in.\n\nAnyway, I live in a rural area as you can tell where it's very hard to find a job as a programmer, but would be willing to relocate - even to a bigger city, I just don't think I could ever live in a massive tech/population hub area like in California or New York. It's just not me. My resume has no programming jobs on it, just an internship I did at the community college I went to, but I've been working on a game in Unity in my spare time and have a link to that on the resume. I may be partial, but I think the stuff I've done is actually pretty impressive, especially the enemy AI that does some pretty nifty things. All that said, I have a few questions and anyone taking time out to answer me would be doing me a huge favor. Programming isn't my be-all end-all. I've considered a lot of things like health care and the trades for example, but I don't think I would fit in with the \"salt-of-the-earth\" people that the trades attract, and I'm tired of all the \"sure-fire\" health care careers that I look into and find out that they've gone bust in my area because colleges pump out graduates (I think this has happened to ct/mri tech in my area, which was something I was really banking on). So here are the questions: \n\n1) Anyone know much about programming/software development outside populated areas? Is it still in demand in slightly less populated areas? Are the hiring criteria more or less stringent?\n\n2) You hear a lot of conflicting info about computer programming. I've heard that if you can program your way out of a wet paper bag you can get a job, and also heard the exact opposite. I need a general idea of what the job market is actually like from people who are on the inside of the industry.  Not these stupid internet articles that give bls data with no context.\n\n3) If I've gone 3 or 4 years since graduating with no programming job, is that going to be a problem with me getting a job? Any suggestions if so?\n\n4) Anyone know if it's even possible now to get a job with an associate's degree in this field?\n\n5) I don't have to work in computers. I had a long-standing idea that I'd go into ct/mri tech at my local university. I've heard the radiological sciences including sonography and ct/mri tech are more saturated than all the job articles let on. For Christ sake though I need to figure something out. Should I just throw caution to the wind and do that instead? I'm sick of all the research ad nauseam!\n\nMany thanks.",

So that means I have NO interview experience at all; I'm in my senior year and applying to jobs, and I never prepped for these interviews over summer because I had some other post-college plans. \n\nAnyway, I had my first 30min phone interview w a start up a few days ago and I totally thought I bombed it. Struggled the \"tell me about yourself\", and when he asked me more technical stuff like \"what is a class\" and \"what is inheritance\" etc, I really struggled answering them. Not necessarily bc I didn't know what they were, but I forgot how hard putting thoughts into English is. I gave him a very weak and unconfident answer, but it was still technically correct I guess. I read through this sub a lot, so when he gave me a \"design etc etc\" I think I did a decent job explaining my thought process. Honestly, outside of the fact that I was having a full on panic attack after my horrible answers, it was also kinda fun. \n\nWell I somehow got an in-person interview that won't be until the end of next week, but I need to prep. I was really going to use this company as a learning tool to interviewing bc they're not exactly #1 on my list for places to work, but at the same time after reading more about them I like their product a lot and the small start up environment seems really better aligned to what I like. Also I don't want to spend the 2 hrs embarrassing myself in front of the entire dev team...\n\nI've been reading through this sub more, and I know there are a ton of resources for DS and algorithms, so I don't think I need those linked, but in terms of when I'm physically there I'm nervous about how to act/talk/just be I guess. I'm normally extremely laid back but at the same time can be anxious, very humble (I don't know shit apparently after that phone interview lol), pretty introverted, and I think behaviorally I'm on the safe side. What other more specific questions should I ask them there? Should I bring a few copies of my resume? Is this going to be like a bunch of short technical interviews with the team? Ahhhh\n\nI have another phone interview with a much larger company tomorrow that I actually do want to work for. I dug up my old Java and C++ books to review those basic class/inheritance/object/variables/etc REALLY basic stuff just to know how to explain them. The thing is most other interview resources are focused on algorithms, and I'm trying to get through the phone interview first and i don't think they really ask for algorithms and stuff. There's only so much you can focus on in a half hour so: what are the main, key software stuff I should look to absolutely know? Also, how in the world do you answer the \"tell me about yourself\"...I'm so used to really laid back lab position research interviews that this industry stuff is like next level wtf. And to top it off tomorrow's interview is like a webcam/phone convo? ugh\n\nI know this sub is full of resources, I've saved a few and there are a lot I've seen that I never saved (like a huge github repo of EVERYTHING you need to know?)\n\n",

Never formed a relationship.\n- Second, 3 months at a startup, CEO said if I ever needed anything don't hesitate to ask, so I'm assuming he means a reference. However, I think the reason why my time there was so short was because I didn't produce an output to their liking. They never mentioned this, they cited money issues for letting me go. I've gotten better, but I hesitate to include him as a ref. \n- Third, current job - wouldn't want to use them as a ref if I'm still working for them.\n\nWhat do you guys think?

However, I have a very strong interest in geography and maps and feel I would love to focus my career in that direction. I have one free elective left, and when I spoke to my advisor about my interest, she recommended I take a GIS course to familiarize myself with all of the software and was extremely enthusiastic about just how many industries use geographic software and for so many purposes. I will be trying to get into that course if I can. Until then, I've started the Coursera UC-Davis Intro to GIS course, have downloaded ArcGIS, and am going through the interactive ArcGIS book. My favorite courses I've taken so far have been Numerical Methods, Database Design, and Adv. Data Structures and Algorithms. It seems like a lot of that stuff is used if I go this direction. \n\nSo, my question is, what sorts of jobs should I expect and in what industries? What can I be doing to focus on that path? What CS skills are needed in these sorts of jobs? Any other advice you can give me? Thank you so much for your time and your input.",

Every single performance evaluation i have received an outstanding evaluation and i have a very good working relationship with our CTO/CEO. \n\nAbout 5 months ago we ended up hiring a senior developer Anon. Anon seemed like a great fit, and had some glowing recommendations and came from a company that did something similar to us.\n\nDuring our second one on one they told me that:\n\n* I wasn't qualified to be team lead due to only having 5 years experience.\n* They didn't feel comfortable with my decision making process.\n* They also found progress to be extremely slow for their liking\n\nWhich kind of came to me as shock, and when i pressed for suggestions and made my self open to recommendations and improvements i was brushed aside.\n\nSince then working with them is the single most draining thing at work.\n\n* Lately they have just gone straight to our CTO with anything, and when our CTO rebukes them and sends them my way. They just drop whatever issue they have, and avoid me.\n* Anon seems to fight and argue about every single task assigned, and often times try to overrule me on every little thing. During our last sprint planning session Anon basically said \"I don't think this sprint planning is working out\", and pulled up their own version of the sprint plan. Thankfully our CTO shut them down, but it still looks really bad.\n* Anon constantly tries to interject and become involved with absolutely everything. For example recently me and a coworker, were discussing AWS costs, and anon basically forces their way into the conversation, saying stuff like \"Our AWS setup feels immature, and doesn't seem fine tuned at all, but i have experience using AWS let me redo it all from scratch\". \n* Anon is constantly pushing us telling us we need to \"rewrite large chunks of our product\" because we have too much technical debt in this area in their opinion. When the people who work on these components and services have the opposite opinion. \n* Atleast once a week we get an email from Anon at 2-3am saying they will be late, because they spent all night doing me or another devs work because it was \"blocking\" them, and typically is an indirect jab at my planning skills. \n\nMost of the other senior developers apparently despise working with this person. Last time i went on vacation for a week anon more or less fought hard to more or less take over the role as acting team lead from the person i assigned it to, and i came back to chaos. Unfortunately several of the other senior developers, just don't want to fight or argue with this person so they get walked all over. Unfortunately as our company has become bigger and bigger our CTO has less and less times to take part in the day to day affairs of dev, so we loose that power check. \n\nI have offhandedly mentioned how difficult this person is to work with to our CTO, however i feel addressing or complaining to him about this person will come off as me looking petty. What should i be doing? I am really not the most dominant type of person. \n\nI apologize if this comes off as whiny, this is just really burning me out. ",
