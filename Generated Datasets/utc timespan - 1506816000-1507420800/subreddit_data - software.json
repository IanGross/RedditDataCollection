This is a must.\n* A way to write and easily access detailed descriptions. Markdown is preferred for formatting. Nice if it supports attachments.\n* Doesn't focus on dates/durations. These are personal projects done in my own time. They will be done when they'll be done. I may chose to spend my time on something else and I don't want to be shamed by the tool that I'm behind the schedule.\n* Nice if it supports basic task statuses (open, in progress, done).\n\nI want something to keep track of *what* needs to be done, not *when* it needs to be done. Most tools I tried that provide task dependencies are built around Gantt charts. They provide nice visualization of dependencies but almost universally lack detailed descriptions and are way too attached to calendar.\n\nI like [OmniPlan's Network view][1].\n\nIf only dates/effort could be replaced with descriptions.\n\nMacOS or web-based.\n\nIs there such a thing?\n\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/IQRic.png",

I find that using HTML and JAVA is fairly easy, but I've only really used them within the confines of educational platforms like codeacademy. I'm ignorant in the actual logistics of putting up websites. I feel stupid asking these questions, but here it goes. \n\nIf I were to install the WAMP software, and host a website, would the website only be up when my computer is running? Would it be wise to use a second computer simply for running the server if I wanted it to be up full time? Does hosting a website bog down a router and make my data usage go way up? Should I make sure I have unlimited data and a really good router? If I have a website up, and I start to get lots of traffic, does monetizing them with ads really generate much cash? Could I see myself making a substantial amount of money by building up websites and selling them? (All this assuming of course that I had enough experience down the road to make decent stuff.)\n\nThis is just a hobby for me. I'm not really that interested in just getting a job coding. But if I could pay rent by doing this, or just pay for steam games and the occasional vacation that would be pretty sweet. ",
