Essentially we're looking to create an application/Outlook extension that would classify emails into various categories  like \"Important/Not Important\" or \"Project email, Contract talks, Trash\", we're not totally sure on categories at the moment, if it could be user defined it would be more useful I guess. But yea that's the general idea. \n\nHow could one approach such a problem, is text-mining the right approach or should be we looking into AI/Machine Learning techniques or a combination of the two? I read a bit about Bayesian Probabilities and how using previous results sets you get a matrix table of probabilities and that's used to determine where new data would be categories. Is this the best approach or are there alternatives we should be looking at? How do we even get the first set of probabilities if that's the way we went, would we have to go through a bunch of emails and classify them manually to get an initial result set? \n\nAnything you think might be useful to learn or look at would be great, thank you.
