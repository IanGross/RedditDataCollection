So far it seems to work; I'm just wondering if there's anything I should be doing differently.  \n\nAlso, is this the best way to be working with large files?  I tried it with an 8.6 MB file and had to abort because it was taking so long.  Is there a more efficient way?\n\nEdit: I've been informed that one rookie mistake I'm making is writing a TSV-parsing program at all, when a perfectly good one already exists.",

I know what nginx does, but my understanding of gunicorn and gevent are guesses at best. Afaik, gunicorn is a python server that spawns gevent threads based on how many CPU cores and blocking i/o you have, and there's one gevent \"worker\" for each request currently being handled?\n\nSay I want to port the API currently running on Django to Sanic or APIStar:\n\n - APIStar uses their in-house uvicorn which uses uvloop... I'm assuming uvloop is the thing that manages all the callbacks and is needed to make `await` work, and uvicorn is the analog to gunicorn to spawn just one uvloop per CPU core since it's asynchronous, is this anywhere close to correct?\n - Sanic is built for uvloop, but on their deployment instructions, it just says to just run it with `app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=1337, workers=4)` which seems to be a departure from previous deployment patterns... How come it doesn't need something like gunicorn/uvicorn? Does `app.run()` take care of whatever it is that uvicorn would've been doing? Is systemctl still used here, or do I just run it and leave it?",

The user will query for a specific # and they'll get all the data associated with that.  As such, I'm not if the logic to search for the proper file (assuming they contain multiple entries) would be very feasible.  \n\nMy data consists of 200,000+ unique python dictionaries.  Searching for the 154,493rd entry if they're all jumbled 5 per json file would be very awkward and I definitely cannot fit them all into 1.\n\nTherefore, I chose to just create individual json files for each dictionary.  Each dictionary will contain a decent amount of information as well.  \n\nQuestions:\n\n- Are there any inefficiencies from having many JSON files vs few, in terms of storage?  Will 5 individual JSON files be the same capacity as 1 with all 5 dictionaries?\n\n- Will it be more efficient to search through many files or try and write logic that can determine the proper file to search for X entry?",

            "selftext": "I have a small python application that is distributed to several users. Right now we manage a lot of configuration options via hard coded values in our GitHub repository. This works, as long as everyone that is running the script pulls the most recent version of code from GitHub. It's...cumbersome, but has worked while we were small. We're not as small any more and this architecture is getting difficult to maintain.\n\nThe new plan is to migrate our configuration to dynamodb and have the distributed scripts pull from here to get the latest configuration. We are planning on using the [serverless framework](https://serverless.com/). An advantage is that we can completely eliminate the `git pull` step that some users had trouble remembering. \n\nHowever, we're running into a bit of a problem in figuring out the design for how to do this. We'd like to use the [Python RESTApi with dynamodb example](https://github.com/serverless/examples/tree/master/aws-python-rest-api-with-dynamodb) to accomplish this. The problem is, we don't want everyone to be able to write/update/delete configuration options. That is currently managed via GitHub where only select members of the community have permission in GitHub to merge changes into the repository. We do want everyone to be able to get configuration options though. (Like anyone could now by just cloning the repository)\n\nIt looks like roles are set in [serverless.yml](https://github.com/serverless/examples/blob/master/aws-python-rest-api-with-dynamodb/serverless.yml), but this looks to be a single role where everyone connecting to the API would be able to do everything. \n\nIs there a way to have two different credentials? We'd like to have the readonly credentials embedded with the script on GitHub. By default, anyone running could pull the latest configuration and run the script as expected. The second set we envision having in local OS environment variables, and if these are set those would be used to do the update/create/delete options. I'm open to other ideas if OS variables aren't appropriate.\n\nHow can I set this type of architecture up so that everyone gets the default readonly options but selected instances of the same script can use the write functions if they have permission?",

In essence, it just reads from stdin.\n\nYou can view the GitHub page [here](https://github.com/budgebi/pipeable) and you can install the package with `pip install pipeable`.\n\nI'd really appreciate any feedback on the documentation and/or any general commentary about the package itself.

            "selftext": "We're making a project for college where we have to send data via TCP using the socket library. Both the client and the server are written in python 2.7 using the socket libraries. \n\nThe length of such data is variable so we thought about sending the frame size before the frame itself so we can recv() the frame size. We could've used a synchronization sequence but decided against it (probably not the smartest choice).\n\nAnalyzing the TCP packages with wireshark we see a difference between the sum of the payloads and the received data length (which matches the size sent by the server). Even the sum of the packages size (including headers) is less than expected. The packages size is 1514, the payload size is 1448 and the difference between frame size and received frame is a multiple of 66. This causes problems when trying to process the data and read another frame. \n\nOur first concern was that we were reading payload data as if it was part of the TCP headers, but given that even considering the whole TCP package size as payload we are nowhere near the frame size (the difference is about 5KB) we think this is not the case. \n\nWe never serialize the data before sending, could this be the cause or make the symptoms worse? The data length sent by the server is calculated using len() of the data string, and I personally think this could be affecting our results. \nOne of my teammates observed that when our data length is consistently under 27KB, we have no problem receiving the packages. \n\nThanks in advance.

If someone can push me to the next step I would greatly appreciate it.\n\nThe concept is a simple squares program that works like the squares/money game you may have experienced before watching a football game with friends. There is a number grid with 0-9 on the x and y axis. Each person pays a dollar for each square they want. The score at the end of each quarter determines what square is the winner. A tie of 7-7 would mean the person who owns 7x7y wins. \n\nI want to be able to send people a link and let them pick squares. It would be great to have a login component. So user logs in, all users see the same grid, and the grid updates as people select a square. \n\nI've learned some very basic python, installed python and pip, ran through some tutorials on python. Should I be using Django or flask? Should I host it with heroku? Should I consider firebase? What do you recommend for a database and frontend? If you were tasked to make this, how would you start? Also, is this a decent project to start learning python for web apps?\n\nSorry if this is super vague and not actually a small project. Would really just like a little advice and direction.

My usage scenario involves data analysis involving bioinformatics, and I have several ongoing projects in a remote cluster. My current methodology is mounting cluster locally using sshfs, and then use them as local pycharm project directory. This method however hogs pycharm resources to keep up with file syncing, and thereby preventing pycharm from doing certain basic tasks like syntax checking, variable typo checking, etc. Also, I have remote  python interpreter set up in pycharm, but I don't use it currently. I have been using local interpreter to run code locally with test sets before executing them in cluster with real data. Git version control is possible here as well but quite slow at times.\n\nI realize sshfs is not the recommended method and now trying to do it the right way (I think) using pycharm's [deployment] (https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/deployment.html) feature. In my tests so far, however, the way deployment works is that you work on local copy of files, and then these files get synced to remote cluster. However, I don't see an option to locally see directory structure of remote projects, or to choose which remote files are permitted to be edited locally. Also, unlike sshfs. method, deployment method doesn't seem to allow remote version controlling either.\n\nI think there must be a better way of getting this done. Here is my wish list of features, ideally:\n\n* Be able to manage code remotely (currently working)\n* Execute code remotely (currently working)\n* View directory structure of the project (even if I don't get to edit them)\n* remotely manage git version controlling (not sure if this is possible). I tend to forget to commit if I have to use git via command line.\n\nOr, if there is a better method to do these things, please let me know.",

So the next hurdle is \"how\" to adequately support multiple Python versions across a *very* large number of hosts ... including some legacy hosts that we \"just can't get rid of, yet\" (hint: old 32-bit libraries that folks have yet to figure out how to fix).\n\nAnyway, I regularly come across \"simple\" differences such as Python 2.6, versus early 2.7, versus reasonably current 2.7. And, not surprisingly, there's difference in the languages that often catch me off-guard. And, there's always hopes that I could at least use something from \"\\_\\_future\\_\\_\" to make my life easier ... the problem is, what, exactly?\n\nHere's one I regularly hit, for example\"\n\n    # Because there's Python 2.6 out there, still...\n    with cd(last_run_path):\n      with hide('stdout'):\n        pass\n\n...when I'd rather just...\n\n    with cd(last_run_path), hide('stdout'):\n      pass\n\nMy *assumption* for something like this is that I might get lucky enough to find a python module (or update) that would allow me to just use a \"from \\_\\_future\\_\\_ import *foo*\" type declaration and, hopefully, cut out some of the pain. But, I'll admit I'm still a little weak on that full understanding, and [those sorts of docs](https://docs.python.org/2/library/__future__.html) are still a bit daunting (not to mention, 2.6 is clearly EOL'd at this point, and we \"can't\" quite update it on systems right now).\n\nSo, that all said, any help is appreciated to help me over this \"knowledge hump.\" How do other people do this in large production environments? Are there any good resources someone can point me at for \"best practices\" or similar in managing python installations across large installations (even from a devops perspective).\n\nThanks in advance!",

I've also installed NLTK though aside from running through the examples, I didn't really know what to do with it, lol.\n\nThat being said, I'd love to get some thoughts on how others got started with NLPs. I don't really see how I can take the route of say.... When someone says, \"how many users are online\" OR \"what are the total users online\", how do you go from that to knowing to run a function to count the total number of users online? That's where I get a bit lost because I can see how to do that with exact matches and some wild cards, but I don't see how to use the NLP to just know that both of those sentences should mean the same thing.\n\nI'd really love some insights on how to use a NLP.

I'm also finding that the work queue is becoming more of a stack, and one person's project can slip through the cracks and pushed down the list because someone else is shouting louder, and the other side of that is that it's difficult to give progress updates and finished products often seem to arrive randomly from the point of view of my users. \n\nI've been trying to find a software project management tool that'll help me organize, and also give feedback to my users whenever they want to check up on progress but I'm not having much success.\n\nI'd also ideally like to have a bug tracker in there and integration with GitHub, but the latter is a luxury\n\nI've looked at a few things like MS Project, but it seems to be more oriented towards general project management and not software projects. Additionally, a lot of the packages I see out there are cloud based and have a monthly fee, and that doesn't work for the budget I have for this - it's far easier for me to request a one-off payment for something than a recurring fee and I don't want to be left with no access to my project if someone loses a grant.\n\nWhat I'm looking for needs the following:\n\ninstalled locally, and not on the cloud\n\na single price for an (indefinite) license. Open source would be great, but not a deal breaker.\n\nless than 10 users (probably closer to 5)\n\nup to 10 projects, with milestones, and some way of submitting brief progress reports\n\nthe ability for other users to login and read progress, add to projects, request features and submit bug reports. Even better if they can be emailed whenever the status of their project gets updated\n\nsome way of generating reports of how much time (days, not hours) per month has been allocated to which project.\n\na simple UI - not all my users have strong computer skills\n\nedit: I should have said that it has to run on windows, that's all we have in the lab. We have too much hardware - microscope cameras, aquisition rigs, video monitoring - that's unsupported by any other operating system\n\ndoes anyone have any recommendations?\n\nthank you in advance",

            "selftext": "So I've recently dived into competitive coding, and discovered that I'm indirectly being forced to use some weird, horrific language called C++.\n\nI absolutely adore python, but its lack of simple (but important) data structures like BBSTs (sorted containers in general), bloom filters, etc is painful.\n\nHeaps and hastables are easy and fast since python includes them.\nI've used this elegant piece of python I found via this subreddit for making trees\n\n    def tree():\n        return collections.defaultdict(tree)\n\nDoes anyone know of similar, short and elegant snippets for other data structures?\n\n\nAnother huge problem is the painfully small recursion depth. Even with `sys.setrecursionlimit()`, solving a dynamic programming problem with python almost never works. [This answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/26873813/2570622) explains why python has such a low recursion limit, but a reason like\n> Guido doesn't want a language where deep recursion is idiomatic. (And most of the Python community agrees.\n\nis weird and unpythonic! Last time I checked, python was open minded and was not about forcing programmers to use it only for simple problems.\n\nAre you guys using python for competitive coding? How do you get around these issues?\n\nThanks.\n\n-- --\n\n- I can't use [Jenk's Sorted Containers](http://www.grantjenks.com/docs/sortedcontainers) because Competitive Coding doesn't allow importing libraries like that.\n\n- I remember Raymond Hettinger mentioning in an old talk that they're looking into adding useful data structures (like bloom filters) in Python, but I haven't found any follow up material.\n\n- [David's PyCon talk: Generators: The Final Frontier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1twn9kLmYg&index=51&list=PLIoJ3PkAEIvwnkJjvixHIYOH0ErGKBxFc) shows a wonderful way of \"hacking\" the recursion depth by using lazy evaluation, but doing that in competitive coding makes debugging hard and code run significantly slower.\n\n- Competitive coding isn't a good indicator of programming problems that one faces in real life. But being forced to use an ancient, poorly designed, overly verbose, dangerous language like C++, just because the Python community chose some hand wavy reasons to omit good features, makes me sad.",
