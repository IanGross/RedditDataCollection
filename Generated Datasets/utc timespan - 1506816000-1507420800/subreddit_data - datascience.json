I recently had a problem cross my desk that I had trouble framing, and thought I would appeal to the subscribers here for help.\n\nThe problem:\nWe give out discount codes in our emails the way many companies do. We noticed that the incremental revenue (revenue per customer) on some of these code-centric campaigns was lower than the holdout groups, leading me to believe that some of the customers receiving codes would have placed an order regardless of having received a code.\n\nI wanted to test this hypothesis.\n\nFor example: Customer A orders every Monday and spends an average of $20 per order. His order patterns don't change upon receiving a code, but he'll use a code if given one. All of a sudden, due to discounts, we're getting an average of $15 per order from this customer because of the frequency with which we send codes.\n\nAny idea how I could approach this problem?",

Before you roast me and tell me to go use the search button or the wiki, please know I already lurked through it. \n\nKeeping that in mind,\n\nI'm a senior in undergrad (3 year bachelors where I'm from) in a B.B.A. specialised in Business intelligence. Since the term is pretty broad and based on what I read here I figured it was pretty similar so thats why I'd like your inputs on what to do next. \n\nFor my undergrad profile, I'm in top school in my area (Eastern Canada) with a > 3.5 GPA. I'm participating in many academic competitions and just recently came back from a student exchange in Singapore. \n\nIn my school, BI major has classes that ressemble a mix of IT,math,Finance and marketing. Essentially we will learn SQL and NoSQL through Microsoft Server, SAS through data projects where we learn to extract format and analyse data,Tableau to visualize , Java where we develop applications and on my end I took a VBA class (I was going in finance until very recently). \n\nWhen I speak with recruiters, the response I get will be that they are super interested in hiring anyone with a BI oriented degree. For example: I went to see a big hedge fund this week and they were recruiting for Private Equity positions and I asked them if they needed BI majors and they were almost begging me to apply (at least that was the feeling I got).\n\nThat being said I'm really torn between heading to do a masters degree and working next year.For the masters, I have two options that I'm considering: Studying at my local university or going to France and studying at a Grande \u00c9cole (their Ivy league). I'd like to highlight that I'm bilingual (English and French) so there wouldn't be a language barrier. \n\nSo heres where I specifically need input: \nI read about the war between Python and R on this sub (I feel that I would want to learn one eventually) but for the moment is SAS sufficient to work ? \n\nWill I learn significantly more by going to do a masters or by working \n? \n\nWill I be at a significant disadvantage compared to actual programmers or math majors ?\n\nWill the masters significantly boost my salary ? (The statistics aren't widely available on the schools website since the programs are so new) \n\nTL DR: currently in school torn between grad school and work; know SAS but no R or Python don't know if it puts me at a massive disadvantage. Any input is appreciated :)\n\n",

            "selftext": "I'm currently a non-technical professional (healthcare middle manager) with a desire to change careers. I have an MA in English and a year of doctoral work, so I understand academia, but I never followed through. I also have a decent amount of STEM training (calculus through multivariate, differential equations, introductory linear algebra, discrete math, C++ programming, data structures, engineering stats), but that's now 10-15 years ago, and I'm pretty rusty.\n\nI actually started down this path looking into web development in Python, but before I made much headway, a work project led me to look at the publicly-available Medicare cost reports for nursing homes. While looking into how exactly I would extract and analyze the data, I read up on SQL, Python, and pandas, which led me to articles on the current state of data science. For the first time in a long time, I found something that made me go, \"I want to do that.\"\n\nSo long story short, my actual math, stats, and programming chops are just not there. I can remember bits and pieces of my college courses,  but I haven't touched the material in over a decade. I've read a lot of this subreddit, and I came across [OSSU's Data Science Program](https://github.com/ossu/data-science). After a lot of hemming and hawing, I finally started, but thumbing through everything, I realized that this is approximately 4 years of material following the stated guidelines, which are admittedly quite lax (5-12 hours of work a week).\n\nStill, that's a long, long time, but I also realize that this is a field full of PhDs, so there has to be something said for the knowledge base required to perform the work. I have 2 major questions:\n\n1) Can anyone comment on the quality of the coursework and actual course layout? I really like the introductory linear algebra course. I really feel like I'm getting insight into the material, not just learning to solve homework problems.\n\n2) Short of enrolling in a structured program, which isn't an option right now, is there any other (faster) way to get a solid foundation to be able to work as a data scientist? A lot of online MS programs assume a technical background that I don't have.\n\nI'm not desperate to get out of my career by any means, but it's definitely something I want to transition away from in the future, and I'd like to start pivoting now, whatever that looks like. Data science just seems like the most interesting avenue at the moment.\n\nI realize that you can make a pretty good living running queries and generating reports, but that's not particularly interesting to me. To use an example I'm familiar with, while you can find very useful information doing queries from the Medicare cost reports (e. g., average nursing wages), the much more interesting questions to me aren't nearly as simple and, from my uninformed perspective, seem to require more sophisticated tools:\n\n* Are there relationships between amounts and types of spending and profitability?\n* Can a nursing home's cost report be used to predict its 5-star quality report?\n* Is the nursing home industry going to see expansion, stagnation, or contraction in the coming years?\n\nAny insight would be appreciated!",

So I've figured out what I should learn and it's definitely something I want to go into and would get passionate about. I love what I do, but i think I want to try something different and challenging now.  etc.\nI just need a few clarifications.\n\n\nMy background\n  I have a BSc in Information technology. I currently work as a Systems/Business Analyst for one of the top 3 ERP companies. My domain is mainly in supply chain mangement. I have about 7 years experience as a systems/business analyst.\n\n  I have a somewhat intermediate knowledge with programming especially in Java. Because i do maintenance and sometimes I have to debug and I write scripts with Jmeter for automation testing. So my algorithms and SQL knowledge i would say is intermediate. On the side I also do freelancing of web development. Mostly just wordpress sites.\n\n\nSo I understand I need to learn Python and maybe R. I was very good in mathematics and physics in high school.  I Had an A in all the mathematics and statistics courses I took in college. But I might have to have refresher courses which i think I would grasp easily.\n\n\nSo my plan now is to increase my side income (I create contents for people From Articles, to graphics, social media content etc) and I also have a small business on the side) for the next 6 months and learn all I have to learn to go into Data Science or Machine learning. After 6 months, quit my job and get a masters while still self studying and working on ML or DS projects. I come from Philippines and did college there so getting a Masters either in Europe or the US will increase my market value if I have to get jobs in western countries.\n\tSeeing my Background and domain experience in Supply chain Management, \n\n\n\u2022\twhat would you advise to get a masters in? And what areas do you think I can focus on while self studying and working on DS and ML projects ?\n\u2022\t What path would you advise me to take? Data Scientist or Machine learning Engineer.\nLooking forward to anything you can advise me on.\nThanks\n\n\n",

            "selftext": "Hi everyone, \n\nI have two job offers and I'm having a really difficult time choosing which one (it\u2019s a wonderful predicament to be in).  I'd like to get your opinions on how I should go about making this decision.  I recently graduated with a B.S. in math and I've been wanting to work in machine learning and artificial intelligence.  My dream job in the future would be working on the cutting edge in the fields of data science/ML/AI, in a large tech company like FB, Spotify, Google, etc.  I am from NYC.\n\nHere are the factors between the two companies:\n\nType of company: Tech startup vs. government contracting (consulting gov agencies) firm\n\nSalary: 83k vs 90k with similar benefits.\n\nLocation: NJ (1 hour from NYC, where I'm from) vs. Washington D.C.  \n\nSize: Similar, <50 people\n\nCulture: I visited the office of the tech company and it seems to have wonderful people/culture.  On the other hand, I did not visit the office of the D.C. company and I don\u2019t have a great idea on their culture.  In fact, I only had 1 phone interview with them before they decided to give me the offer (only because they were pressured that I already had another offer and would be accepting soon).\n\nPeople I\u2019d be working with: Tech firm has 1 other data analyst whom I will be working in tandem with, along with product managers. Gov firm has a few other data analysts, mostly working on the lower level analytics.  I will be the first hire in the gov firm with focus on more of the advanced analytics, and will be mentoring others.\n\nResponsibilities: \n\nTech firm: \u201cData analyst\u201d title, working mostly with AB testing and experimentation of apps, building reports/dashboards on KPI\u2019s/metrics, building models for customer LTV and predicting churn, as well as pricing optimization. Explore how advanced analytics can be applied throughout the company.\n\nGov firm: \u201cData scientist\u201d title, developing data analysis solutions that include ML/AI to client problems such as giving input on data infrastructure, and building machine learning models (very high level overview of responsibilities, as it is dependent on the client problems).  \n\nI am from NYC so in terms of location, I am leaning more towards NJ to stay close to friends and family.  I\u2019ve always wanted to work in tech as well, but the government job seems to have more of a focus on ML/AI than the tech firm.  On the other hand, I\u2019ve heard that government jobs don\u2019t have as much flexibility with the work, as it is all about meeting client needs.  \nAre there any other factors that I should consider?  Is there anything else I should consider in regards to working for government clients and how that could affect the kind of work I\u2019d be doing?  Just looking for any kind of input that could help with making my decision.  Ultimately, I don't think either choice would be wrong but I want to optimally position myself to work on even bigger things in the future.\n\nAlso, thanks to the data science community here in Reddit.  I\u2019ve been browsing a lot in the last year and have learned a lot from this sub.  So happy to finally achieve my dream of landing a DS-related job and I would be happy to share my experiences.  \n\nUpdate:\n\nThanks for all the insights.  I decided to accept the offer at the tech firm, main reasons being proximity to home, culture that supports personal growth and fun, and wariness of red tape at government firm.  As someone pointed out, there's much less uncertainty working at the tech firm and I'm sure I'd be happy there.",

            "selftext": "Hi all, first time posting here. I'm new to data science in general, and most of my stats background is practical and applied, not very academic. So I'm a little lost on this thing right now.\n\nI'm learning the ins and outs of scikit learn and found that there doesn't seem to be a straightforward way to calculate p-values for coefficients without either doing it manually or pulling in another library. I Googled around a bit for the reason behind that and came across [this thread from r/PyStats](https://www.reddit.com/r/pystats/comments/3c6idg/sklearn_stderrorspvaluesttest/).\n\nThe relevant part is here: \n\n> The point of sklearn is ML and, in the end, ML really only values accuracy. Whether a model or an individual feature/predictor is \"significant\" is not relevant.\n\nHow true is that statement? In applied ML, do organizations typically not care as much about p-values for coefficients, so long as the results are accurate? \n\nThanks, and apologies for the noob question. I'm still learning!

            "selftext": "Hey /r/datascience!\n\nI'm a n00b here, and I'm looking for some suggestions.\n\nI'm building a new ETL, and starting to focus on the \"E\" step. I have not been able to find an existing project which seems to cover my requirements, so far. I could build my own, but I'd love to not reinvent the wheel if I don't have to.\n\nThis service extracts data from several different APIs, for hundreds of different companies each. Each one of these API calls can then dynamically generate an arbitrary set of additional API calls in turn, to be launched in parallel.\n\nA hypothetical example: I call an API to grab all x subreddits from Reddit. Then, for each of these x subreddits, I then call the API again to grab all y posts. Then for each of these y posts, I again call the API to grab all of the z comments.\n\nGiven this hypothetical, you can see that you end up with a tree of execution, where each node in the tree can produce n number of additional child nodes, to be processed in parallel.\n\nWhat I am talking about here is some mix of a web crawler (except more constrained to well understood, but varying APIs) and a batch processor. I need each of these nodes logically separated like this, so that if one fails, it only stops execution for the possible nodes that come after, but not the nodes at it's same level.\n\nI've looked into building this as a set of microservices, using an event bus to schedule jobs for a pool of workers. Then I could record the state of each of these paths, and track when something fails, and be able to debug and retry.\n\nI would love some suggestions for this, or an idea of other projects that look very similar, so that I might gain some inspiration from them.\n\nThanks!\n\nEdit: I've looking into Airflow and Luigi, but they seem better as proper workflow orchestrators. Perhaps even as the rest of the ETL, once the data has already been aggregated from these various APIs. Another was AWS Batch, but it's not very mature, and the UI stinks. If you disagree with either of these interpretations, by all means, lemme hear why :)",

I would prefer not to just throw in a covariance mateix and select from there.  I\u2019m aware of a good deal of the LA behind PCA why it is not considered a factor selection method-but as pca maximizes variance along a new set of axis closest to the data space-could i use the loadings to select the variables with the highest degree of variance?\n\nso in a nutshell: for an experiment where the variability and correlation between the variables is the only set of selection criteria, can pca or another analgious method be useful from a more statistical perspective?Thanks for your input!",

But yea that's the general idea. \n\nHow could one approach such a problem, is text-mining the right approach or should be we looking into AI/Machine Learning techniques or a combination of the two? I read a bit about Bayesian Probabilities and how using previous results sets you get a matrix table of probabilities and that's used to determine where new data would be categories. Is this the best approach or are there alternatives we should be looking at? How do we even get the first set of probabilities if that's the way we went, would we have to go through a bunch of emails and classify them manually to get an initial result set? \n\nAnything you think might be useful to learn or look at would be great, thank you.

So while i was trying to figure out what i want to work on I started taking small random projects (excel/translations/data entry) on freelancer.com (lol) two of which led to a remote \"position\" in two start ups. \n\nThe first is kind of irrelevant, but the second was a start up developing an AI platform for logo recognition (which they succeeded and they were acquired by a very big company) where i spent almost two years. Initially my role there was \"data entry\" (tagging/annotating logos/videos using their program) then i was kind of in charge of myself and a group of four regarding this data entry (plan how to distribute work to do it faster and meet the strict deadlines) + checking/reporting on the after-training results if they seem logical or odd or any other observation (nothing that needed more than common sense and basic maths understanding) and in the end i was offered to join their QA team. Of course at the time i didn't even know what QA is or does since i was never involved/following the cs or it field, but anyway i suffered from a burnout and had to stop working for a few months. \n\nSo fast forward some months ago, their offer still stood but I was still considering what i want to do and anyway i decided i wanted to be involved with data science. I was researching what and how but nothing seems clear enough. I know that my education isn't enough to be looking to become a data scientist and I never aspired for a big career anyway but I want to work on something relevant. I always had an interest in data and very good understanding of maths and statistics but i never really occupied myself with those other than my studies with the exception of some statistics i was checking myself.\n\n\nMy maths level is typical ce stuff i.e calculus, linear algebra, integrals, matrices, regression etc (it's been years so i dont really remember clearly what ive done) and i know there are more complex stuff i need to catch up but i think it's just time that i need. Regarding coding i almost lack any coding background, which i hate to not know what i don't know, so i started teaching myself python. Of course i know that i don't have fundamental knowledge in cs which makes me feel stupid, I always hated application without knowing the theory. Machine learning, algorithms, neural networks are stuff i also lack almost any real knoweldge. \n\nIn a matter of months i'll be moving to the UK anyway and this is where I need your assistance. I know I can't learn/refresh everything in a few months and don't have yet a clear view on the aspects of data science but also i don't clearly know what my knoweldge should be for a given position. I mean i'm not even sure about what positions exist. From my understanding till now what suits me better is less formal coding more analysis but not too deep in maths yet.\n\nSo what i really want from you, judging on the above, is to guide me by telling me what position i should go for and what is needed for that. I know i can \"fake\" these two years as having a proper position eg operations manager or qa if i learn python by then. I think i can focus and learn 2-3 of the following in the given time (i know believing you know and applying it in a real job can be far from each other): python sql visualization maths\n\nTry to learn python by finishing an online course on python for data science and try to experiment with it?\nOr instead try SQL?\nTry to learn the most out of these or focus on specific tasks? Or instead master VBA excel and study those while working?\nFocus on refreshing maths or visualization?\nShould i try and fake i know more on these that i already know and work+learn or no?\nThanks\n",

            "selftext": "I always hear people telling me R has a higher learning curve. That's pretty much a signature statement for them. But python is much, much more complex. They have lists, data frames, arrays, tuples, dictionaries, LISTS of dictionaries, and I'm probably missing a bunch of other forms of storing data. For R, it's almost dumbfounding how straightforward it is. You have vectors, and you can still create dataframes. Also, you have the tidyverse, which makes working with data easier than a day at the golf course. \n\n\nMuch of Python's packages are dramatically more complex as well. Take web scraping. You have to use beautifulsoup/bs4, and then you have to import lxml, and then you parse it with some arbitrarily complex code. On R, you just read_HTML, use rvest to read it in, and you're set. You can literally [scrape a page in R in less than 6 lines! ](https://youtu.be/gSbuwYdNYLM?t=166) They pull an entire table from Calpoly's admissions site, in SIX LINES! [The same operation in Python is quite arbitrary and is a frivolous venture](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/web-scraping-tutorial-python/). Look how long this freaking tutorial is, just to scrape the simplest page! What is worse about this example is that rvest will look for ALL tables, in the entire page, and then you just specify what you want. But for python, you have to use a ridiculous for loop to loop over every single table you want. This pretty little example makes it seem like you're going to have a gleaming and wonderful output, which really isn't the case. \n\nHere is some code for a 'simple' webscraping script for Python I found on the web on the suggestion of an expert Python programmer: \n\n#########################\nfrom urllib.request import urlopen, Request\n\n\nfrom urllib.parse import urlencode\n\n\n\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n\n\n\nurl = 'https://opir.fiu.edu/instructor_evals/instr_eval_result.asp'\n\n\n\ndata = {'Term':'1171', 'Coll':'%', 'Dept':'','RefNum':'','Crse':'','Instr':''}\n\n\n\nr = urlopen(Request(url, data=urlencode(data).encode()))\n\n\n\nhtml = r.read().decode()\n\n\n\n\nsoup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'html.parser')\n\n\n\n\ntables = soup.find_all('table')\n#########################\n\n\n\nYes, this is SO much simpler than R, especially to a novice who has barely ever programmed (/s)! Plus, the code doesn't work, and results in a nasty error: \n\n\n**'UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xe9 in position 5779573: invalid continuation byte'**\n\n\nDo you really think a novice is going to understand what this is, or how to solve this issue? \n\n\n\nIn addition, installing packages or libraries in Python as a beginner is downright infuriating. After installing Python, you have to literally MAP pip to your environment variables on your PC. This took me several hours working on an older machine (I have no control over the OS used on some of the machines I work on), as it wasn't easy to locate, and even when I found it, it simply wouldn't accept the directory without extensive troubleshooting. The alternative isyou can download Anaconda/miniconda, but then, depending on your IDE, you have to go into your settings and choose which interpreter to use... The default, or the anaconda. \n\nIn R, guess what you do? Go to packages, click install, type the package, done. Then you click the checkbox to enable it. No interpreters, no editing environment variables, or spending hours fussing over errors you get with Python. Anyone got wonna dem Staples EASY buttons ?\n\n\ntl;dr: Everything is more complex in Python. R is the boogeyman to those who haven't put the slightest effort into learning it, but Python involves doing far more work for the same result, with much more frustration **if you are a novice**. I have no doubt that in eight years, after working with Python for years, that I will have a sufficient grasp on it. But as a novice, Python has a lot more to learn than R does. I'm not saying Python is a horrible language, but I am saying that it most certainly isn't as novice/user friendly as it claims, and it's a bit harsh that the data community makes R look like the boogeyman when in reality, it's the friendly neighbor willing to help. \n",

However im very confused with the path I need to take to work in your field. I have a lot of questions and they're all very jumbled, bare with me please.\n\n-What university majors/programs should I take? Mathematics, statistics, computer science, economics, am i going to need a combined or double major?\n\n-Is it useful to take any buisiness/finance (or even a science like chemistry) as a minor?\n\n-I've seen a couple undergrad Data Science programs, but im skeptical (maybe wrongly so) that it would be too broad or not be as applicable as for example a degree in computer science would be. If i see a program labled data science does it contain everything i need and should i just jump right in?\n\n-Is actuarial science a possible pathway? Is it similar at all to data science?\n\n-Will i need a masters or phd to have success in finding a job? Or will a bachelors do just fine with coop programs/internships being very important?\n\n-I'm likely to go to university in western Canada, ie: UBC, UVIC UofA, UofC, SFU etc... So if anybody has any insight or experience with any of those schools and their programs that would be insanely helpful!\n\nAs you can tell im super confused but also very curious, hopefully my rambling hasnt come off as too naive.

The main method involves dividing coin price movement over a long timeframe (one or 2 years) to different phases and ignoring short term noises. Crypto Currencies are traded just like stocks so the system will be similar.\n\nI started learning data science in python for this and other similar purposes last month (I am doing undergraduate in computer science and have strong programming knowledge but my mathematical knowledge is bad (Upto A Level Maths)). I want to create a system for it because it will be faster and it will remove bias and i can experiment other stuffs too. I learned the basics of data science and charting from udemy and now have started doing Machine Learning Courses in coursera and datacamp along with quantopian and financial courses from udemy. Because of my weak mathematical background - i have been doing some extra work on Theoretical Machine Learning courses.\n\nWhere should i focus more of my time on to create such a system? I want to complete all these courses but i want to learn enough to create a system like this first if it is possible (Easier to continue learning when you have something for it) Is learning Machine Learning suitable for a task like that (I have done some basics and i am not sure yet)? Should i focus on Machine Learning related programming courses more (datacamp) or the theoretical part too (The coursera course which is a bit harder)? What field inside Machine Learning (if yes)?

Hence this question; \n\nCould you give me any tips or pointers as to how I could create the best possible take-home assignment? \n\nWhat I've come up with; \n\n- Give the candidate a cleaned-up dataset and notebook containing customer activity over an n-week period\n- Task the candidate with creating a classifier that predicts wether or not a given user will churn. AKA will this user be a loyal retaining customer over a certain period t, or not (= churn) \n- Ask the candidate to clarify their presented solution, which algorithm(s) they might have used and why. \n- Ask the candidate to determine and list the importance of each feature in the churning model   \n\nWhat I could use help with; \n\n- This is a very practical assignment, perhaps little theoretical insight is demonstrated. Should I put more emphasis on the algorithms the candidate might use? SVM, nearest-neighbour, gradient boosting... Perhaps ask for them to make a comparison and choose what they think is the best possible option? \n\n- I feel I should incorporate a few steps; The first question should be easy, the second of reasonable difficulty and the last one preferably frustratingly hard. Ideally this last one tests the candidates ability to handle hard situations and how they mitigate and communicate them. The perfect answer would be something along the lines of \"I tried to apply approach A, B and C to little avail. I feel that if we want to meet the goal represented in the question, perhaps we should be concerned with ingesting specific data. For example a user's X and Y datapoints would be a good place to start.\" \n\nThanks in advance!\n\n\n \n",
