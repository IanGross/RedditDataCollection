Unfortunately I had to notice that it isn't that easy to get an overview about what implementations exist because all lists I could find were pretty old. So I have created my own and thought I'd share it here for anyone else who might be in the same situation. It's a pdf since it's going to be part of my thesis. If anything is missing feel free to extend the .tex file.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nI reworked the list so it now also lists which sensors are used per approach and a few quick notes on what it is about.\n\nI would also really like to update the wikipedia entry and have tried to convert the list using [pandoc](https://pandoc.org). Unfortunatly that just produced a lot of nonsense for me.

From that image I can get the rototranslation of the camera wrt the pattern, which means I can get the angle between the camera and the ground. How do I get the position of the vanishing point in the image (in pixels) from this information?\n\nFor now I can consider only the vertical position, I expect that the horizontal position can be computed using a similar process.\n\nMy reasoning is that if the camera is perfectly aligned with the ground (angle between camera and ground is zero) then the vertical coordinate of the vanishing point is ImageVerticalSize/2. If there is an angle, then the vertical coordinate should be ImageVerticalSize/2 - focal_length * tan(angle). However, the result I get is not correct, even with a small angle I get a position that is several pixels off. What am I doing wrong?\n\nThanks!",

My current thinking is since the object is a circular, \n- I can define a ROI, \n- use an algorithm from the OpenCV tracker class to detect the movement of the ROI,\n-  detect circles within the ROI \n-  Draw a line on the centre coordinates of the detected circle\n-  Calculate Velocity (bonus)\n\nMy issue currently is that I don't think this method is robust enough. - - For example, there can be multiple circles in the ROI, this isn't much of a problem as I can just define to find for the biggest circle. But I struggle to detect circles within the ROI anyway\n\n- I've tried implementing other techniques such as background subtraction but I'm not sure if this works best for my use case. This is because, I'm not sure you can define a certain part of the frame to perform background subtraction on. if you're using the whole frame, there are other moving objects in the frame such as the lifter and people walking in the background etc.\n- Regarding estimating the velocity of the bar, I'm completely stumped and not sure where to start.\n\nTL:DR Essentially, I'm trying to define a region where the plates on the bar are in a video and track the barpath in the video. How do I start?\n\nThere are similar apps that achieve what I'm trying to do but I'm trying to create a simple lightweight version for personal purposes.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKx_No-yDww\n\nAny ideas are welcome.\n\nThanks,\n\n",
