Stack parameters, for example, but there are quite a few others\n\nDoes anyone have a good example of using the CFN CLI that works the same way as the console? The primary use would be updating the stack template (ie, upload a new template, and then click next-next-next-next-next...).\n\nIt seems like to do that, you have to make a request to the API, get the stack details, parse out a bunch of stuff that isn't necessarily easy to parse in bash, and then feed it all, unchanged, back to the update command.\n\nOr am I mistake about that?",

The function body can be viewed [here](https://gist.github.com/behrangsa/49a3aca294ba8324255b3df0e75b6eb9) (`01 - home.js`), but for completeness I have copied it here too:\n\n\tmodule.exports.handler = function (event, context, callback) {\n\t    let body = `\n\t\t<!doctype html>\n\t\t<html lang=\"en\">\n\t\t<head>\n\t\t    <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n\t    \n\t\t    <title>Serverless Home</title>\n\t\t    <style>\n\t\t        .hidden {\n\t\t            display: none;\n\t\t        }\n\t\t    </style>\n\t\t</head>\n\t\t\n\t\t<body>\n\t\t    <h1>Lambda, API Gateway, and Cognito</h1>\n\t\t    <h2>Federated Authentication with Twitter</h2>\n\t\t    <div class=\"hidden\" id=\"login-panel\">\n\t\t        <a href=\"/dev/api/auth/twitter\">Login with your Twitter account</a>\n\t\t    </div>\n\t\t    \n\t\t    <div class=\"hidden\" id=\"logout-panel\">\n\t\t        <a href=\"/dev/api/auth/logout\">Logout</a>\n\t\t    </div>\n\t\t    \n\t\t    <div class=\"hidden\" id=\"profile-panel\">\n\t\t        <p>\n\t\t            Your email address is: <span id=\"email-address\"></span>.\n\t\t        </p>\n\t\t    </div>\n\t\t    \n\t\t    <script src=\"https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.2.1.min.js\"></script>\n\t\t    <script>\n\t\t    \n\t\t    function isLoggedIn() {\n\t\t        // TODO: Implement\n\t\t        return false;\n\t\t    }\n\t\t    \n\t\t    function getEmailAddress() {\n\t\t        // TODO: Implement\n\t\t        return '???';\n\t\t    }\n\t\t    \n\t\t    $(document).ready(function() {\n\t\t       if (isLoggedIn()) {\n\t\t           $(\"#email-address\").text(getEmailAddress());\n\t\t           $(\"#logout-panel\").removeClass('hidden');\n\t\t           $(\"#profile-panel\").removeClass('hidden');\n\t\t       } else {\n\t\t           $(\"#login-panel\").removeClass('hidden');\n\t\t       }\n\t\t    });\n\t\t    </script>\n\t\t</body>\n\t\t</html>\n\t    `;\n\n\t    callback(null, body);\n\t};\n\nNothing special here. It works as expected.\n\n### 2- `GET /api/auth/twitter -> obtain-request-token.handler` \n\nRedirects the user to Twitter to get user permission to authorize my app to use the Twitter user's account. This part also works and the function definition is shown in the [same gist](https://gist.github.com/behrangsa/49a3aca294ba8324255b3df0e75b6eb9) (`02 - obtain-request-token.js`). \n\n\t'use strict';\n\n\tlet oauth = require('oauth');\n\n\tlet CONSUMER_KEY = 'USE YOUR CONSUMER KEY';\n\tlet CONSUMER_SECRET = 'USE YOUR CONSUMER SECRET';\n\n\tmodule.exports.handler = function (event, context, callback) {\n\t    let oa = new oauth.OAuth(\n\t\t'https://api.twitter.com/oauth/request_token',\n\t\t'https://api.twitter.com/oauth/access_token',\n\t\tCONSUMER_KEY,\n\t\tCONSUMER_SECRET,\n\t\t'1.0A',\n\t\tnull,\n\t\t'HMAC-SHA1'\n\t    );\n\n\t    oa.getOAuthRequestToken(\n\t\tfunction (error, oAuthToken, oAuthTokenSecret, results) {\n\t\t    if (error) {\n\t\t        console.log(`Error: ${JSON.stringify(error)}`);\n\t\t        callback(error, null);\n\t\t    } else {\n\t\t        // Do not log token and token secret in real-world scenarios\n\t\t        console.log({\n\t\t            oAuthToken: oAuthToken,\n\t\t            oAuthTokenSecret: oAuthTokenSecret,\n\t\t            results: results\n\t\t        });\n\n\t\t        let response = {\n\t\t            statusCode: 302,\n\t\t            headers: {\n\t\t                'Location': `https://api.twitter.com/oauth/authenticate?oauth_token=${oAuthToken}`\n\t\t            }\n\t\t        };\n\n\t\t        callback(null, response);\n\t\t    }\n\t\t}\n\t    );\n\t};\n\n### 3- `GET /api/auth/twitter/callback -> auth-callback.handler`\n\nI am stuck here. In particular:\n\n* I don't know how should I use Cognito and which Cognito APIs I should call here to add the user to an Identity Pool, get a session or a JWT that I can use from the front-end to call my protected APIs\n* I don't know how to make my API Gateway end-points protected\n\nDoes Cognito even support this functionality out of the box? With Auth0 the whole process is quite simpler. I glimpsed through [Firebase's docs](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/twitter-login) and even that looks quite straightfoward to use with Web Apps.\n\nI have written this proof of concept using Serverless. The `serverless.yml` file is also in the same gist and the `tar.gz` archive.\n\n---\n\n## Update:\n\n[Here](https://gist.github.com/behrangsa/500c61ae2e938a3910b6b8b7c2d3497a) is an example using Express and Node OAuth. As you can see, it is quite straightforward to implement the [authentication flow](https://dev.twitter.com/web/sign-in/implementing).\n\nThe problem is how to delegate this to Cognito so that I don't have to store access tokens, etc. in a custom database.\n\nProtecting the end-points using Custom Authorizers should also be simple as there are a few examples and blog posts out there that show how to implement one.\n\nThe only parts that are not obvious how to do are:\n\n* How to use Cognito to redirect the user to Twitter?\n* How to handle the Twitter callback using Cognito to populate the IdP?\n* How to use Cognito for session management (e.g. for SPAs that only use APIs to communicate with the backend)?",

I want to run these systems with minimal on-host data protection so I want to isolate them as much as possible. I also want them to access resources on our internal network so I need them to connect back over VPN. The very little internet connectivity they made need should also route through our internal network so they can leverage our existing security controls. I also want to avoid S3 traffic traversing back over the VPN.\n\nI'm aware of the concepts I need to make this work, but don't see if and how it can fit for this use case.\n\nIn theory I can leverage an S3 endpoint to control traffic and update the route table to send 0.0.0.0/0 back over the VPN. However, in order to access resources at my premises, I believe I'd have to use our internal DNS servers. My guess is that this would break whatever logic AWS uses to use the S3 endpoint.\n\nIs there a way I can do this all?",

Even ls -ltr on a small directory is taking 10 seconds to complete. Using cloudwatch metrics, i can see that my burst credit balance is 0B and my permittedThroughput is 131 kB/s. \n\nThe site was fine during testing, but over the last week of people actually using the site, i can see my burst credits and permittedThroughput both decreasing till basically 0 (today) making the site inaccessible. \n\nI am using elastic beanstalk, with wordpress entirely mounted on an EFS volume. The size of the EFS volume is 2gb, and not likely to grow much more. \n\nHave i picked the wrong filesystem? I had no idea that performance would drop so drastically, and assumed there was some baseline that was better than the throughput of a floppy disk... It all seems to be mostly based on the amount of data in the filesystem itself (bizarre to me, and im having trouble wrapping my head around this concept).\n\nWould EBS be a better solution here? I am planning on rolling out a CDN to do caching for the website but I am not quite there yet. I am not sure what is using up all those burst credits, is there a way to tell what process is using the all the credits up? is there a way to set a certain amount of IOPS i want. I can pay for whatever, its not a problem. Just want to fix performance. I cant seem to adjust the EFS settings (if any) after creation.\n\nIn this case, i was using EFS because i may want to scale out the website later. As i understand it, if i use an EBS volume, i cannot mount from more than one host, so it makes scaling out impossible (except for instance size (scale up)). \n\nany feedback appreciated.",

We have roughly 500GB of images that we display on our website and use for training some CNNs. When we train a model, we also create some images and data like saliency maps that we then display on our website for review. \n\nIt seems that common practice for web hosting of images and the like is to use S3, but our images aren't all public assets. Some are restricted to certain user accounts, so we currently use our website to authenticate requests to image assets that are stored on the file system, but I'm not sure if we would be able to do this with S3.\n\nIf we go with EFS, then it will be simple to store, access, and serve these files across our machines, but EFS seems a bit pricey and I'm concerned that with limited burst credits and low base thoroughput that it might add significant lag to the website. However, our website is relatively low use.\n\nAlternatively, if we can use S3 for serving assets securely, then my thought was to use S3 and EBS with a data pipeline for synchronizing images. If we scale to use many machines at once for running models then I would need to create duplicate EBS volumes for each machine, and each one would need to synchronize back to S3?\n\nDoes anyone have any input into this situation? I am new to AWS so I may be unaware of other services/features that would solve my problems. \n\nThank you.",

For example:\n&nbsp;\n\n\n        - Namespace: 'aws:ec2:vpc'\n          OptionName: Subnets\n          Value: !If [ publicorprivatesubnets, !Join [\",\",[!ImportValue myEc2PublicSubnet1,!ImportValue myEc2PublicSubnet2,!ImportValue myEc2PublicSubnet3]], !Join [\",\",[!ImportValue myEc2PrivateSubnet1,!ImportValue myEc2PrivateSubnet2,!ImportValue myEc2PrivateSubnet3]] ]\n\n&nbsp;\nI want to add on a !Ref value within the template itself to all of the myEC2**** subnets. The myEC2**** come from an exported value from another stack. For example, when I created my base VPC + subnets, it created ELBInternal-99, 99 being the unique ID. The ID will be entered during the stack creation of Cloudformation. So I want to do something like this, but it doesn't work:\n\n        - Namespace: 'aws:ec2:vpc'\n          OptionName: Subnets\n          Value: !If [ publicorprivatesubnets, !Join [\",\",[!Join [ \"\", [ \"!ImportValue myEc2PublicSubnet1, \"-\", !Ref vpcStackId ],!Join [ \"\", [ !ImportValue myEc2PublicSubnet2, \"-\", !Ref vpcStackId ],!Join [ \"\", [ !ImportValue myEc2PublicSubnet3, \"-\", !Ref vpcStackId ]]], !Join [\",\",[!Join [ \"\", [ !ImportValue myEc2PrivateSubnet1, \"-\", !Ref vpcStackId ],!Join [ \"\", [ !ImportValue myEc2PrivateSubnet2, \"-\", !Ref vpcStackId ],!Join [ \"\", [ !ImportValue myEc2PrivateSubnet3, \"-\", !Ref vpcStackId ]]] ]\n\nmyEC2***** will come from an exported value from another stack, vpcStackID will come from the value enter during Cloudformation wizard.\nI want the net result to be, with a vpcStackID of 99, to be:\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\nmyEc2PublicSubnet1-99,myEc2PublicSubnet2-99,myEc2PublicSubnet3-99\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAny ideas?\n\n",

I was looking into the ELB, and wondering if we can use health checks to automatically route the traffic from one wfe to another if it goes down?  But otherwise keep the traffic to a specific wfe until that happens?  Also, looking into ELBs I see that the way to enter it in DNS is to create a CNAME for it, would the CNAME be the current existing site collection URL?  We are using host-based site collections, would I have to create a CNAME for each one?  We are trying to make this as transparent to the end-users as possible.

(as opposed to cloud formation or maybe a mixture) I am starting to look at this having done 2/3 of the Associate certs (which doesn't go into this level of detail) and would be really interested in peoples opinion on how they do this, particularly around deploying ec2 instances to multiple regions 100% automation including automatically setting unique hostnames / specifying each region separately etc.\n\nThe other question I have if that is ok is around security, if you ARE using Ansible how are you dealing with this? I know that you can use ansible-vault OR you can simply use an IAM role attached to the controller I guess.\n\nThanks",

However, we need something operating ASAP, and Connect fits the bill nicely as it's quick to deploy (it only took minutes to get something up and running with our on hold messages and the basics setup), and cost effective, and non contracted. That's the big selling point right now, as it doesn't lock us in. We can use it for 2, 3, 6 months, doesn't matter. If we find another solution elsewhere, we can drop this at no penalty. If it works, we can keep it. \n\nI'm just curious to hear any feedback about using it within Australia if anyone else is yet? Any pointers or advice from your deployments?

Conversely Citus distributes shards across multiple machines and then queries are performed in parallel by communicating over a network. My assumption would be Aurora is much faster as long as your data can fit into a single machine, is that true? At what data scale does it become necessary to scale horizontally by sharding?",

            "selftext": "My team and I are still fairly new to AWS and we've been having some performance issues with an application that we're developing. We're having trouble debugging the issues and I'm wondering if we've made some assumptions that we're unaware of.\n\nThe application is a TCP Server which runs using ECS on a c4.large instance. Whenever a device connects to the server we publish a message to an SQS queue using Rebus service bus.\n\nOur application works perfectly fine when a device connects every few seconds. We begin to see issues when we ramp this up to about 5-10 connections per second, which is the requirement of our production environment. We are able to simulate the connections with system tests.\n\nThe problem seems to be that Rebus times out (we have given it a 6000ms timeout) when sending messages to SQS. This doesn't make a lot of sense to us because Rebus' SQS integration uses the AWS SDK which should be capable of sending hundreds of messages per second.\n\nThe strange thing is that when I run this test in my local development environment it runs fine. The TCP Server runs locally and sends messages to the SQS queue and I never see any Rebus timeouts.  \n\nThe only way that I can recreate this issue locally is by connecting my machine to a slow WiFi connection. I start to see the exact same behavior. This would suggest that the latency between my wired connection in my office and SQS is lower than the latency between EC2 and SQS! I refuse to believe that so it must be an indication that somewhere, something has gone wrong.\n\nWe have also tested running the application in a dedicated EC2 instance without Docker as we were worried that the network bridging could be an issue. We still ran into the same issue.\n\nAny ideas?",

            "selftext": "Hi All,\n\nI've seen this issue a few times, but never with a resolution, so I figured I'd ask this again.\n\nThe TiWorker.exe process, \"Windows Module Installer\" by description, kills my CPU on a regular basis.  This is a Server 2016 T2.small instance that is fully up to date.  It seems like every other Monday as soon as my instance starts (starts at 7:30AM local), it starts hacking away at the CPU and a little bit at my root volume.  I've disabled every cleanup task I can find, and told Windows that when it must run automatic maintenance, to do so at 3PM - once I've built up plenty of CPU credits.  But this morning, the CPU gets drained of all its resources in about half an hour, and there's nothing I can do to stop it, other than a full stop then start of the instance.  It feels like it's every couple weeks, but my [CloudWatch report](https://s3.amazonaws.com/tpsbucket001/Capture.PNG) says otherwise (though I know it did happen more frequently through the summer).\n\nIs there any known issue in EC2 for this AMI (ami-f1b5cfe7)?  Or a fix available for the OS?  Pretty much any thread I can look into?  There were only three hits for TiWorker in the AWS forums, and to no avail.\n\nThanks\n\nPS: I tried to post this on AWS support forums.  Despite having an AWS account for years, I've never posted in the forums, so I had to create a forum account - and was \"too new\" to be allowed to post.  Ironic, isn't it?",
