We welcome posts that aren't as suitable for /r/crypto, such as basic cipher-cracking challenges and discussions of simple data hiding.\n\n## Tips\n\n* **Submitting a question** about codebreaking or sharing your own puzzle? Read the [**Frequently Asked Questions**](/r/codes/wiki/faq).\n* **If the ciphertext is in a picture**, please consider transcribing it before posting. You'll get far more responses that way.\n* **Hide spoilers** using `[spoiler!](/st \"The Titanic sinks at the end\")`, which renders as [spoiler!](/st \"The Titanic sinks at the end\"). This is the preferred method, since it still works when a comment is viewed in the inbox or when subreddit stylesheets are disabled.\n* **Solved?** Use the flair button on your post to indicate when someone has successfully solved a puzzle you've posted.\n\n## Related subreddits:\n\n* /r/crypto: Strong cryptography (where neither brute force nor knowing the encryption method helps very much)\n* /r/ARG: Alternate Reality Games, which often involve codes and ciphers\n* /r/solving_reddit_codes for reddit-based ARGs and codes such as A858\n* /r/ReverseEngineering: When you're trying to crack a program's algorithm for something\n* /r/puzzles: Puzzles in general\n* /r/CracktheCode: Crack codes to win prizes (sometimes games)\n\n## Elsewhere\n\nIRC channel, staffed by /u/bowiz2:\n\n* Join #\\/r/codes on irc.freenode.net\n* Or use the web interface: http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=/r/codes\n",

I noticed that it was also in ROT13 and you will note my results at the bottom. I have no experience with wargames and was only able to work through level 1 with the help of other forums.\n\nI'm not sure where the clue \"WaterCactus\" comes in to play but it may be a key.

They aren't worth much, and it seems there are only one of each type in the dungeon. They don't stack with each other, meaning they're all different \"types\" and each has a different description, which will disappear permanently from the game should you die and lose it or decide to sell them. Here are those codes. Good luck, everyone!\n\n[Cryptium #1](https://i.imgur.com/5y4vrpy.jpg)\n\n[Cryptium #2](https://imgur.com/d6Lbe5m)\n\n[Cryptium #3](https://imgur.com/u8AJt8X)\n\n[Cryptium #4](https://imgur.com/r1EzwXB)\n\n[Cryptium #5](https://imgur.com/4waz7Wi)",
