You can use 3D Touch to quickly start scanning. Any tag scanned will open with the appropriate function selected. What I mean by this is sms tags open an sms window with the information filled in, email does email filled in, location tags show map, contact cards bring up contact import, etc. Other NFC apps just show text or open the URL. \n\nI have an update in review adding in multi scan, Apple Watch remote, and HomeKit ability. \n\nIf you want to see anything extra or run into any issues, let me know!\n\nThanks for checking out the app!",

            "selftext": "This past summer, I got my first personal MacBook Pro (13in nTB 2017) that I bought with my own money from working long hours in a restaurant.  It's been pretty great so far.\n\nI'm just thinking back to my days in elementary school and how Apple really pushed for putting Macs in schools.  My school district (up until high school) strictly only used Macs.  I would be surrounded by a Mac environment at school, and then when I got home, everybody used a Windows machine.  Funny thing is, in elementary school, I thought Macs were made for children with their simple and unimposing form factors.  Not to mention that the OS had a dock full of giant, fun, icons.  \n\nNow I'm looking back at Apple's history of MacBook line-ups, and I'm wondering which Macs were used in my elementary school, when I first encountered Macs.\n\nSo I think I'm talking about the range from 1998 - 2008's, a pretty wide range, but really not sure when my elementary school would switch out equipment.\n\nAs for the iMac's, the computer lab had the white, plastic-looking ones.  I think the iMac G5.  We had a couple of iMacs that had the swivel neck, but the computer lab mainly used the G5's.  In the classroom, we used the lighter blue iMac's (1998) with the plastic shell.\n\nThe laptops are a little hard for me to remember, because we didn't use them as much.  I remember specifically that the Mac laptop cart that the school used had Macs that could close securely with physical latches.  I remember this because I would keep playing with the latches and fidgeting with them.  This is the hardest one for me to remember, but I think it might have been the first MacBook Pro.  But then, I asked myself why my school would get MacBook Pros for elementary school children.  Not really sure on this one, but could have also been a PowerBook, since the MacBook Pros didn't come along until later.  Same question remains though.  I do, remember, however, in 4th or 5th grade, we got a chance to use the all-white MacBooks.  Definitely remember those -- I would sit by the laptop cart and play with the MacBook charger tips, and when I touched two of them together, it would create a spark (lol).\n\nAnybody else's elementary school use Macs?  (Our family wasn't that rich, but the school district we were in was pretty affluent).  What do you guys remember about your first encounter with Macs?\n\nSide note:  Anybody else play Nanosaur in school when the teacher gave us time to use the computers?\n",

And when I say crap I mean, taking a few seconds for safari to open a new blank windows, messages taking a few seconds to show my keyboard etc. and my battery life went to crap, I was losing 30-40% in an hour or two of light use. \n\nIf that\u2019s what you\u2019re experiencing, I highly recommend you all try restoring it on iTunes(I know we all hate iTunes). I did that two days ago and since then, I feel like I have my old iOS 10 iPhone 6+ back. It\u2019s performing great. No lag or anything of that sort. \n\nI didn\u2019t restore a backup from iCloud either. That may or may not have played a role too. I know when I had the iPhone 4, restoring from backups was causing battery drainage problems, so I didn\u2019t do it. It sucks to lose progress in games but i felt like a non laggy phone was more worth it than my saved game progress. \n\nI know y\u2019all have heard this before, as a solution, so I just wanted to pass along that doing this brought life back to my phone, because I was super ready to pick up the 8 or X if it didn\u2019t get better. But it did, so if this helps any of y\u2019all then I\u2019m happy :). \n\nHave a good day y\u2019all. ",

            "selftext": "I've had Google Drive forever for photos and Google Docs. I recently backed up everything to iCloud and started using Numbers. \n\nA couple of observations: Numbers is super annoying on phone when putting in formula and getting a range of cells: the formula bar covers the cell you want to select, so I end up typing in the range. Also, Numbers is weird, odd for the purpose of being different?\n\nAnother thing: Google Photos is really fast at uploading/synching photos. Apple Photos took 1.5 weeks to upload my library. It seemed to keep stopping. To check status, I had to go into preferences to find out where it was at. I thought my MacBook Pro was going to overhead just uploading. Also, I chose \"save space on MacBook\" but the library is still massive, hardly any or no savings at all in space. This is hard on a 256 GB device.\n\nCall me an idiot, but I find the implementation of iCloud confusing with having the docs in the cloud, but then they are local on my computer...with Google Drive, even local editing seems to make more sense/seems more intuitive.\n\nWith that said, someone mentioned MS OneDrive. MS has really stepped up their game. 1TB for $69 a year and MS Office included. For 5 people, it's only $99 a year and 5TB. That's a steal. And the interface is quite nice for MS.\n\nIt just feels like Apple is a bit laggy in the cloud game. Just the horrendously slow backups are no fun. For just under $3 a month more, one can get MS Office and Office 365. Add a family plan and its a no-brainer. \n\nHow have your experiences been with the different cloud services / opinion on price and value? MS feels like a tremendous deal. I realize everyone is different and one particular service is best/fine for them.",

Or even cooler, perhaps a hybrid laptop/iPad, that would run iOS when in a touch-mode and macOS when in a \"laptop\" mode.\n\nBottom line: as Steve Jobs once quoted Alan Kay, \"People who really serious about software should make their own hardware.\" Microsoft took that chapter from Apple's textbook with the Surface, and now I feel that Apple needs to take a chapter out of Microsoft's textbook for the future of the Mac.",

That was taking so long to load the initial set up that the computer froze.  I tried leaving the computer overnight doing an internet reinstall but that says at least a week left to download. My last hope now is to use an external 3.0 drive with a partition. That's where my problem lies. I've got a lot of data on the drive and no where to store it and Mac os won't let me just format one partition to the journaled format so I can create a partition.

            "selftext": "**Tldr at bottom** \n\nHello all. I apologize if this isn't the right sub to post this in, and if it isn't, would someone please direct me?\n\nMy mom got an automated call from \"Apple Inc\" saying her iCloud account was attacked. She kept getting the call from different numbers (both legit Apple Store numbers, one in Queens, NY, and the other from the Midwest). After a few robocalls, my mom pressed 1 to find out more information (and to speak with someone.).\n\nThey claimed her iCloud account was attacked twenty-five times, from Europe, no, Russia! And they needed to know if she had a laptop. She said no, but her sons do (**never ever tell people who call you anything personal**). My mother was semi-convinced this was real, because the caller knew her name, my name, and my brother's name (the person on the phone didn't seem to indicate to my mom whose iCloud account was attacked. Maybe all three! (\"No, mom, that's not how that works. None of our accounts are linked,\" I explained later.)\n\nAnyway, my mom eventually called me. I was kinda annoyed because it was obviously a scam (I wish horrible things upon those guys.), but it didn't sound like my mom told them anything compromising, as they wanted someone with a computer to speak with. \n\nFor those who don't know, the above is textbook for a [spoofing-based computer-lock scam that ends with the elderly paying hundreds in prepaid cards to scammers who gain remote control of your computer and lock you out](https://www.macworld.com/article/3185485/security/ignore-that-call-from-apple-about-an-icloud-breach.html).\n\nMy mom said they kept calling after this, every half hour for hours. The person she spoke with said they would until they spoke with me or my brother (laptop owners).\n\nThey called when I got home. Inspired by pro and petty revenge, I thought I could toy with the scammer, but even he didn't know what was going on.\n\nI pressed one after the automated, yet somehow Indian-sounding message. Another, Australian or English automated voice then reminded me I had been put in a queue in between crappy sounds that tried to be music. The conversation I had with scammer was short. \n\nScammer: \"Hello. How may I help you?\"\n\nMe: \"How may you help me? You keep calling. What is this about?\"\n\nScammer: \"...\"\n\n(I can't even lead the guy anywhere because he's given me nothing to go on. There is dead silence for a good twenty seconds. I'm tired. I guess I can't play around.)\n\nMe: \"Please stop calling. This is a scam.\"\n\nScammer: \"No.\"\n\nMe: \"I will be calling the federal bureau of investigation and the police.\"\n\nScammer: \"You can talk to them.\"\n\nMe: \"Please stop calling\". I hung up.\n\nThere doesn't seem to be a way to get scammers to stop spoof calling that I can find (for the layman. I have no idea how one can trace IPs and whatnot.). I know I shouldn't have pressed 1 the second time, but I thought if they knew they weren't getting money here, they would stop calling.\n\nI was wrong. They called again. I'm going to be pissed if they call in the early morning.\n\nSo, anyone know how I can get these scammers to stop calling? Will the autodialers stop if we keep ignoring the calls? \n\nThank you for your time.\n\n\n**Tldr: phone number spoofing scammers claiming to be Apple kept calling my mom. I eventually picked up a call and asked them to stop, they said no and it looks like they may keep calling. Can I stop it? Do they stop on their own? Ty for any advice.**\n",

            "selftext": "In 2004 Apple made tech history by introducing the world's first 17 inch laptop. Until its discontinuation in 2012 due in large part to declining sales, it was the company's laptop flagship; packing in not just a physically larger screen than the 15's, but also a larger battery, better speakers, more expansive keyboard, more ports, and larger storage and ram potential, and more powerful CPU and GPU options, all made possible by the larger internal chassis volume compared to the 15.\n\nI had one of these back in the day and loved it. High resolution is great and all, but there's definitely something to be said for physical screen size. Nowdays you can have both! It used to be that 15 was the largest size high res laptop panels came in, but now there are 4k 17 inch panels available. \n\n17 inch laptops have always been for serious power users; people who basically want a desktop replacement machine. In my experience, 17 inch laptops are fundamentally better suited for this purpose than 15 inch laptops. More screen size, better spec potential, more ports built in (hell, even an optical drive is still common on 17 inch windows laptops), etc... comes together as a powerhouse. Personally I would love to see what Apple could do today if they reentered this market. Their supply lines have improved over the last half decade, and it would show some refreshed dedication to professions/power user customers who have felt more and more neglected in recent years.\n\nFor what such a machine would potentially be capable of if released today, I'd say the new [4k Razer Blade Pro](http://www.computershopper.com/var/ezwebin_site/storage/images/media/images/razer-blade-pro-2017-gtx-1080-front-and-left/1308748-1-eng-US/razer-blade-pro-2017-gtx-1080-front-and-left.png) laptop is a good example (it even looks like a 17 inch MBP).\n\nDisplay: 17.3\u201d 4K, 3840 x 2160\nIGZO, 16:9 aspect ratio, NVIDIA\u00ae G-SYNC\u2122, 100% Adobe RGB, capacitive multi-touch\n\nCPU: Overclocked Quad-Core 7th Gen Intel\u00ae Core\u2122 i7-7820HK Processor with Hyper-Threading 2.9GHz / 3.9GHz / 4.3GHz (Base / Turbo / Overclock)\n\nGPU: NVIDIA\u00ae GeForce\u00ae GTX **1080** (8GB GDDR5X VRAM)\n\nRam: **32GB** dual-channel memory (DDR4, 2667MHz), fixed\n\nStorage: 512GB SSD RAID 0 (2x 256GB PCIe M.2)/1TB SSD RAID 0 (2x 512GB PCIe M.2)/**2TB SSD RAID 0 (2x 1TB PCIe M.2)**\n\nInpute & Output: Built-in webcam (2.0MP), Multimedia keys with scroll wheel, Multi-touch touchpad, SDXC card reader, Thunderbolt\u2122 3 (USB-C\u2122), USB 3.0 port x 3 (SuperSpeed), HDMI 2.0 audio and video output",

            "selftext": "I am a huge, huge fan of the Apple TV. To me, it's one of the most essential Apple products I own, and I can't imagine my tech life without it. I even am a passionate believer in the perfection of Apple's Siri remote. Preface to say, the product idea I'm presenting is not for me. But I understand that the Apple TV is too expensive for many, and that with the impending mega-launch of [exclusive streaming video content](https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/16/16155600/apple-original-tv-content-1-billion-investment), market proliferation is increasingly in Apple's interest, and a TV product at a drastically lower price point would serve that interest. However, it's not very \"Apple\" to just throw out a cheap version of their existing product. A reimagining would be in order. \n\nInspired by [John Gruber's presentation of the problem](https://daringfireball.net/2017/09/cultural_insularity_and_apple_tv), I give you my imagining of the solution\u2014Apple TV Air.\n\n\n**Apple TV Air**\n\n- An HDMI plug-in stick.  \n- Doesn\u2019t ship with or work with a remote. iOS only control, built in to iPhone/iPad.  \n- No apps, no home screen, no TV-based UI whatsoever.  \n- To set up, raise phone next to device. All WiFi, Login information will carry over.  \n- It\u2019s an extension of AirPlay rather than a dedicated device. Like HomePods or AirPods are for music, for video.  \n- When you power on TV, the Apple TV Air will loop the aerial screensaver. That will always be on the screen unless it\u2019s playing or pausing video.  \n- The UI is handled completely on iOS devices. If you want to select a show, you don\u2019t browse on the TV, you browse on your phone.  \n- Selecting content uses all the same iPhone apps as you would use to watch video on your phone. Anything that can play video natively on the phone can play video natively on Apple TV air.  \n- All devices connected to same WiFi network have the ability to determine and control the content on Apple TV Air.  \n- When a video is selected, you simply AirPlay it to the Apple TV Air. A new \"Now Playing\" section is then added to the top of your lock screen\u2014with 15 second skip, play/pause, etc.\u2014and it won't disappear until you press a power off/disconnect button in the widget.  \n- If content is playing on the TV, the phone status bar indicator light turns purple (different from AirPlay). Tapping the purple will immediately pause the content. Tapping again will resume play. Force pressing it will bring up a widget with additional controls, including volume, skip back/forward 15 seconds, and power off.  \n- Once you start playing a video on Apple TV Air, anything you do on phone\u2014leave app, play other videos, take a phone call, leave the house\u2014won\u2019t interfere with that video. If you play music or video on your phone, it won't interfere with TV's content, and will add a second \"Now Playing\" screen to your lock screen.   \n- Any phone connected to the same WiFi will see the same lock screen widget and status bar indicator. Any iOS device connected to network can replace content on screen.  \n- In group settings, this would allow everyone to browse simultaneously to come up with ideas of \"what to watch.\"  \n- Will work with Siri\u2014\u201cHey Siri, play House of Cards *on my TV*\u201d  \n- If you have a HomePod, you can connect it to Apple TV Air and use Siri entirely to control TV without phone.  \n- If you have AirPods, the phone can switch their connection from phone media to TV if desired.  \n- Video and Music only, and only via AirPlay. The only thing this device is for is the watching and listening of content.  \n- $49. Use the Apple ecosystem as a pricing weapon against competitors. By being able to offload capabilities to pre existing devices without sacrificing functionality, the technical needs of the device are much lesser.  \n\nThere are obviously a lot of specific details that would need to be worked out to accomplish this, but hopefully this helps illustrate what a potential Apple TV stick could be. I would have provided mockups to visualize some of what I was explaining, but that's beyond the scope of my abilities. Feel free to contribute any additional ideas of what you would want out of this type of device in the comments. \n\n",

Odd. \n\nAfter several hours on the phone with equally-confused AppleCare specialists, it turns out that I was not sold AppleCare when I purchased the phone and therefore am not apart of the upgrade program. \n\nI called my local Apple Store and was told that I opted for the 24-month financing without AppleCare, which doesn\u2019t allow you to upgrade after a year. I specifically asked to join the upgrade program when I bought the phone, so I was given the wrong paperwork to sign and now may not be able to get out of the contract. The store manager is calling corporate to try and get me an answer. \n\nHas anyone else encountered this in the past?

For the first time ever I drop my phone and somehow it cracks the corner of the screen. I have never had that happen in the hundreds of drops I've had with the 4s and 6. I got apple care and they told me I had to use a replacement off it which I was angry about since it had only been a week but there's nothing I can do.

I'm hoping another trip to the Apple store will help me but it's becoming so tedious to restore from icloud backups and restore game data. \n\nBut seriously, I laugh at that strongest glass ever claim.

I am looking for a mobile solution and am strongly considering a MacBook Pro 2017. My primary uses for the computer are photography, software development (nothing that requires Windows ecosystem), and some light music and video editing (mostly GoPro and such). Please note I am a hobbyist, I am not doing any of this as a source of income.\n\nI have two dilemmas I would like your help with:\n\n1. Is there anything I should be concerned about with having my workflows span across OSX and Windows? For example, are there any crucial exclusive windows or OSX software that I will find myself dependent on? Obviously, any iOS development I engage with will be restricted to the MacBook, but will everything else be mostly cross platform? Please let me know if you have ever encountered any headaches in having a powerful windows desktop paired with a MacBook. It may be better to get a dell XPS or SurfaceBook for my needs in that case.\n\n2. In your experience, would a 13 inch MacBook suffice, or should I spring for the 15? I am a little concerned about running photoshop/lightroom simultaneously on a dual core with 8gb of RAM, not to mention any VMs I may need for development. I did see that Apple will allow me to upgrade the 13 inch with 16gb of ram, but that pushes it very close in price range to the 15 inch, especially as I am eligible for a $200 discount on the 15 and only a $100 discount on the 13. What configuration do you think would best suit my needs?\n\nPlease let me know if you have any advise for my situation, it is very much appreciated. I did a lot of research but still am not sold either way. Thanks!",

I've been tempted to just pre-order it but i want to trade in my 6 to go towards the purchase price and cant really afford to not have a phone for 2 weeks.\n\nAlso other question is how accurate is the online inventory? I've mostly been checking by that but i also went once last week to the store to verify and they were indeed out. So i didnt know if anyone knew if the online stock gets auto-updated right when they get shipments to the store or do they not update for a while to let walk-ins get first dibs before advertising the stock online?\n\nAnd before someone tell's me its in stock at best buy or something, i have to get it from apple store to take advantage of their contract price of $249 for sprint instead of buying the full retail at other stores.\n\nThanks!",

Previously at every subway stop when the iPhone got reception again, the map would update and the location would update to that stop, for some reason that no longer happens. As soon as you go underground the dot goes grey and neither Google Maps, Apple Maps, Waze or Transit will update the location anymore until you go above ground again even if you have reception and or you are connected to the free WiFi.

While it\u2019s been great for the most part, it\u2019s still not always the wow factor we might like.\nToday, however, I gained a much greater appreciation for TV.\nI recently started watching *Homeland* through Hulu. I\u2019ve binged through the first four seasons using the TV app\u2019s \u201cUp Next\u201d feature. But Hulu only carries seasons 1-4. So in order to watch seasons 5 and 6, I had to subscribe to Showtime. So I downloaded Showtime, signed up for the 7-day free trial and first month, and then closed the app without even touching the main menu or looking at the movie/show carousel.\nLo and behold, there, at the top of my \u201cUp Next\u201d [queue](http://imgur.com/gh7cc2M) was *Homeland* S5E1 via Showtime! The TV app used its brains to automatically determine what I needed next and where to pull the content!\n\nTL;DR: It just works.",

I know most of you know how this service works but I got the taste of it recently.\nI have an iMac with 500gb space and all my pictures are stored in a folder. I have kept a backup in my external HDD. And I wanted to keep an off-site backup of my pictures hence I purchased 2TB iCloud storage. But now when I try to copy files to iCloud I see that it is not only using my iCloud space ( which is ok) and also my native iMac space which is stored somewhere hidden in the library system folder.  Now issue is i want to save space in my iMac hence I purchased both external and cloud storage. If iCloud is storing files locally then what\u2019s the point of purchasing iCloud storage? I want a clean storage in my external HDD and a copy offsite in the form of cloud. Anybody aware of any other cloud storage which doesn\u2019t keep files locally?",

            "selftext": "I\u2019m not really sure how a company with that much resources and highly talented teams & employees with an excellent 10 year history in the mobile phones market leadership fail miserably in their iPhones 10th birthday?\n\nI\u2019m an Apple fan since day 1 and I believe I recommend iPhones and apple products in general to hundreds of people. I\u2019m now thinking to shift to another product, the only thing holding me is the iOS and apple ecosystem. What went wrong?\n\n1- Product pricing: Where I live, the iPhone X is exactly double the Samsung S8 price. The S8 build quality is dam awesome, has a headphone jack and water resistant as well.\nI\u2019m quite sure apple priced the X so high because it won\u2019t be able to fulfill the expected demand but that\u2019s not a customer oriented mind set and will lose them a lot of market share.\n\nSo the question is, why should I wait for a product that I believe won\u2019t be available until Jan or Feb 18 that will cost me double the S8 which is available everywhere right now?\n\n2- Release dates: When Google and Samsung announce a new product it becomes directly available for pre-order and you would never fail to find their products once officially released across the whole world. Apple: meh, wait a month for the pre-order and 3-4 months for actual availability (8 months before their next phone announcement). What\u2019s the problem with your supply chain? That\u2019s a foundation of any planning system? Why something related to logistics hold you back from dominating a market that\u2019s so competitive? Can\u2019t really get it.\n\n3- Feature availability: I pay for the products exactly the same amount paid by US customers (if not more due to resellers commissions and freight charges) but I don\u2019t get the full features the US consumers get. Apple pay, News, Maps (directions for ex.), lane guidance, Car play,  Searchable handwringing and a lot more. So you sell your products internationally and you don\u2019t tailor your products by region? Why? You use revenues generated from my regions in R&D for product improvements that aren\u2019t planned for me?\n\n4- Marketing the same product: A lot of companies tend to release same product categories to co exist in a market and get a larger market share by offering a low price and a high price products. Apple released 2 products of the same category with almost the same price tag (300$ difference from the lowest tier to the X) which is a weird strategy. What\u2019s the value proposition here? Probably they know that the X supply is low so they have to fill the market need with an iPhone 8, I agree but at least offer the 8 with a much lower price. I don\u2019t get it really the 8 pricing is a joke compared to the X. I can\u2019t imagine to pay 700$ for a phone that looks ugly compared to the X to save 300$.\n\nApple needs a radical change or it will go broke in a couple of years",

I am a Computer Engineering student and has been using the iPad Pro 12.9\" Wifi 128GB 1st gen model for a few semesters for research, note-taking and just lots of Netflix. \n\nDue to an unfortunate lapse of stupidity, don't ask what really happened... please, I dropped it with the Smart Keyboard and it managed to shatter the glass. About a quarter of the screen is shattered to f*** and it's really bugging me. I can't use it in bed or on the move since my fingers will be holding onto the broken glass and little shards will get into my skin. Now, I have gone from using it everyday, to barely even looking at it. (It's the school term break now btw)\nSo I really want the iPhone X ($1888 where I'm at) and my current situation is, I have about $1000 and I need the iPad more for school. Here's my 3 options:\n\nOption 1: Repair my old iPad Pro for $888\n\nSince it's out of warranty, it's $888 for a full replacement. Does anyone know if they will replace it with a refurbished 1st gen one or a 2nd gen model? If it's the latter, I would love go with this, since I already have the 12.9\" Smart Keyboard. If not, it's not the newest model and $888 for that is a little hefty.\n\nOption 2: Buy a new 10.5 iPad Pro Wifi 64 GB for $938\n\nWell, it's the newest model, really portable and amazing with the Apple Pencil. However, I won't get the Smart Keyboard; I'd probably get the leather Smart Cover and leather Sleeve. I should also get AppleCare, huh... In this case, maybe sell the old iPad.\n\nOption 3: You pretentious c**t. Save your money.\n\nI should probably suck it up and live with the broken iPad. And continue saving for the iPhone X. I can't make it by the preorder date, so I shall wait until next year...\n\nPS: I have a job. Thanks.\n\nTLDR: I have a broken iPad, idk if I should replace it, buy a newer one or just pass. Also, I'm poor af.",

            "selftext": "So I have searched every forum I can find but I have been unable to find a solution (if there is one)...\n\nI have a 2013 MacBook Pro 1Tb SSD and I recently upgraded to High Sierra.  I am an avid GoPro user and have multiple 4 Tb hard drives that have my content on them.  These hard drives were recognized by High Sierra but when I tried to load any content, I got the error -43 saying the content was not able to be viewed.  After doing some more researching I realized apple changed the format for SSD and that they don't read external HDD's.\n\nThis is proving a major issue for me as I am unable to view all of my videos.  Now here is where I made my biggest mistake.  I do not have a time machine backup of my hard drive.  The day before I made the upgrade, I made a backup of my computer as a direct transfer to another external HDD.  So I have a backup of every file I need but not in Time Machine backup.  When I look in my app store to try and download the most recent version of Sierra, there is nothing there.  The most recent OS system that is available is El Captain on which I initially downloaded on 9/15/2015.  \n\n So the way I see it is that I have 4 options:\n\n1) Buy around 16 TB of SSD and figure out a way to transfer my HDDs to SSD in APFS format (~$2,000)\n\n2) Revert back to El Captain and use El Captain as my OS (since I can't find a copy of Sierra) - unless someone can provide me a direct link to Sierra\n\n3) Find a copy of Sierra and erase my computer and boot up using Sierra as the OS and copy all my files over\n\n4) Never see my videos again and keep High Sierra while learning the major lesson of reading the full specs before upgrading\n\nPlease let me know if you have a link to OS Sierra or if there is another option that I am missing.  Everything I read said DO NOT switch a HDD to APFS format, but I am seriously contemplating getting a different computer if my mac won't read the Hard Drives that have all my videos on. ",

            "selftext": "Late last year, after saving up for years to replace my 2008 MBP, I bought the MBP 15\" with the touch bar. I wanted another laptop that would last me years and be reliable. So far, what I have gotten is a very unreliable laptop and unhelpful customer support.\n\nMy first repair was for two issues, the first being that the alignment of the screen with the body, it was flush on one side, but not the other. The other issue was that my 'B' and 'N' key started to not work. I brought it to my local Apple Store, they sent it away and it came came with the top case having been replaced. Great! I brought my laptop home, started to get back to work and it started to freeze after a few minutes of use. Restarting didn't help, resets didn't help. So I brought it back to the Apple store and the genius and I were able to recreate the issues. We had to wipe my hard drive. Luckily I had backed everything up prior to having it repaired for the hardware issues.\n\nAbout a month later, there started to be a metal twang when I clicked the trackpad or the spacebar. Again, I brought it to the Apple Store, they sent it to away to the repair facility and when I got it back, the top case was again replaced, but so was the Logic Board. No idea why the logic board was replaced and the genius that checked me out did not know why. The symptom listed on the printout read 'Cannot Detect Hard/Optical Drive.' I wasn't having any problems with this, so not sure why this happened.\n\nJust a day or so after getting it back this time (mid-August now), there was now the sound of a shifting part behind my screen. From what I saw online it was one of plastic sheets behind the screen shifting, which is not a normal behavior. I called Apple this time before going into the store. The first guy I spoke with, after telling him what model laptop I had, I asked if the shifting sound was just a CD in the drive, which really annoyed me because, well, there isn't a CD drive. At this point, I was frustrated, but brought it back to the Store and had it sent away for repair again. When it came back, it seemed fine, until a few days later when the same issue came back.\n\nAt this point, I have lost three weeks worth of productivity, have had it repaired three times and now a repeat issue has occurred. I reached out to Apple again and worked with a Senior Advisor. He asked me to have the laptop repaired again, I agreed. He said this time, they would do the repair in-store and that they would know I was coming in. When I got to the Apple Store, they did not know what I was talking about and said any repair would have to be sent out. So I called my Senior Advisor and left him a voicemail and emailed him. Now, not only have I been asked to get a 'lemon' repaired for a fourth time, but because there was a miscommunication between Apple, I've made a useless trip to the Apple Store.\n\nAfter this, I told my Senior Advisor I had enough and that I wanted a replacement unit rather than go through more repairs. I had lost weeks of productivity getting it repaired, have gone to the Apple Store under his order only for nothing to come of my trip, and have a less-than-a-year old, $3000+ laptop in need of a fourth repair. What happens after my AppleCare runs out and the issues keep coming? When I pushed my Senior Advisor on a replacement, he never directly acknowledged the question. An email I sent that called him out for not addressing this was met with two weeks of no response, only to get a response of 'bring it into the store and the genius will decide' after I emailed him again asking where we were at.\n\nNot sure what to do at this point. To me, four repairs for a laptop that is less than a year old and costs over $3000 is an unreasonable request. Looking for anyone with advice.\n\ntl;dr: apple doesn't really want to help me fix my relatively new and expensive laptop.",

            "selftext": "Maybe I am wrong ( hahaha humbly awaiting for criticisms )\n\nBut here we go....\n\nIn light of recent presentation by Apple, where they showed off wireless charging, I think I can understand why Apple decided that they can afford to remove the audio port.\n\nFrom Apple's point of view, the world is going to wireless, whether the rest of the world agrees or not. They want to be the guide to it all, and dictate the market. There are technical reasons of course, like more room for other components, but guiding the market is what Apple really wanted. It knows that it has the clout to do so. And if this adventure fails, well too bad, they have the money to back track on this.\n\nThe recent announcement that Pixel 2 is going to lose the audio jack, does NOT prove that Apple was right. There is every chance that this was in the works already. We won't know until someone invents the remote mind reader. But it certainly make Apple's decision look good, and continues the idea that Apple has courage to lead the killing of old technology. \n\nSo, did Apple know about the wireless charging about to arrive a year later? Of course they did, and that is exactly why they took off the audio jack. You can either listen on bluetooth, or use the audio equipment which connect to lightning. That lightning port is the new audio jack. It is not the charger. The iPhone from now on will charge by wireless. \n\nWhether people feel that it sounds better... that is a matter of opinion, from Apple's perspective.\n\nSo the audio jack is not coming back. Wireless charging is in. Right now it is charging via Qi, which has a location range limitation. But it is not hard to imagine eventually wireless will extend to a whole room you are in. You can work in the office, iphone in your pocket, and it would charge.\n\nI think the most gripe people have is due to the fact that this picture is not expressed well by Apple. They should have revealed the audio jack removal, along with the wireless charging, because they go hand in hand. You can not have the audio jack removed without the wireless charging. Come on, the first question expected, when you remove the audio jack, is ' so what do I listen with?' Apple could have really said, 'because you are now charging wirelessly, there is a new audio port, the lightning port! (Or bluetooth [saying this under the breath]) '\n\nThe other way to do this is to reveal the wireless charging first, and then come back and say, 'well, there you are - you can now listen through the lightning port, as you do not need to charge with it anymore.'\n\nI don't know, but from what I can see, Apple had a picture in mind of where this is all going, but revealed in piecemeal, rather than as a whole coherent picture, and this is why people had the most complaint. We are not Apple and we are not mind readers.\n\n\n\n",

I was already thinking of getting a new phone anyway but now these problems are putting more of a rush on things. I've read some other posts from people switching but most seemed hypothetical. \n\nI have two main concerns (other than cost):\n\nI have 64 gb now, but I was kinda bursting at the seams before I restored the phone which makes me think I should get the 128 gb iPhone 7. \n\nBut this brings up my other concern, I'm afraid I'll be outdated (software/hardware wise) faster if I'm buying an older model phone. And this brings up the thought of if I could handle just having 64 gb of an iPhone 8. I could probably utilize iCloud better to free up some space. \n\nAnd obviously cost - the 256 gb iPhone 8 seems kinda excessive in storage but also the $900 price tag is really pushing it. I'm just not sure if it's worth it. \n\nAny thoughts? \n\nEDIT: Went out tonight and got the iPhone 8 64 GB (gold!) and I love it so far :) thanks for all the input! ",

I'm trying to figure out if I can live with it and if I'm just upset because of habit.  I'd like to ask for some of your experience with this.\n\nEvery day at work, I listen to music/podcasts on my phone. I have no interest in bluetooth headphones because I don't want to have another device that I have to keep charging and also I really like the headphones/earphones I already have.\n\nI would need a dongle that allows me to charge and listen at the same time. I know they exist, I can rationalize buying one. But here's where I'm stuck.  99% of the time, I'm listening like this at my work desk. So I could leave the larger dongle permanently plugged in there and feel almost no impact. Once in a while I do listen elsewhere.\n\nDo you people with dongles take them everywhere you take your phone? Everywhere you take your headphones? Do you have more than one dongle? Are they all charge and listen or are some just listen (for the gym say?).  Are the dongles actually good?\n Is the sound quality good enough? Do they have any issues with loose connections over time or hiss or anything at all like that?\nHow have you all solved this issue?\n\nThanks everybody. I hope this isn't too spammy.",

I have now twice this week woken up after my alarm was supposed to go off only to find it is \"going off\". \n\n2nd  Speaker phone glitch.  This has happened to me a few times, I go to make a phone call and it defaults to speaker phone and wont let me turn it off.  The only way to fix it is to reset my phone.\n\nanyone else having these or other issues?",

            "selftext": "\u201cSo I waited a few hours before saying anything, I didn't know what to say that everyone else wouldn't have already been thinking. Usually I like to have something witty or entertaining to say, my closest friends know that I kid because I love. But for this, I've got nothing witty. So this is what I came up with.  \n\nPeople like Steve are the folks that you see in their youth with grand ideas that seem too far fetched to be possible in our lifetime. The really sad part is that there are plenty of people like Steve with ground breaking ideas. You probably know someone just like Steve. But they are either discouraged from pursuing their wild ideas or have them dismissed entirely as foolhardy ventures. It's easy to abandon an idea when you don't think anyone else believes in you, or when people convince you that your idea goes too hard against the grain. Steve is the exception, not the rule. He succeeded against incredible odds he faced early on, because he is a force of nature. It's clich\u00e9, but he truly saw things that never were and asked why not. When the answer he got was \"because that's how it is\", he did not accept it. It's unfortunate that so many have the visions but a rare few have the drive and will. If you want to honor Steve's spirit, don't just make a post or talk about how sad it is that he's gone. Instead, find a friend or family member or coworker and encourage them. Talk with them about their ideas. Come up with a way to help instead of a reason to quit.\u201d",

They're in a folder that I keep as a backup of another drive associated with a different computer, so the apps are downloaded under another Apple ID (not mine). The problem is that the Mac App Store, for some reason, sees these apps on the external disk, sees that they are out of date, and attempts to update them (or would, if I had auto updates turned on). They're constantly clogging my updates tab in the Mac App Store and showing the annoying badge on the app icon. Is there a way to tell the MAS not to search on my external drive (like I can tell Spotlight to ignore an entire folder)? I'd like to leave these apps alone and have their updates not show up in my Mac App Store.",

            "selftext": "I recently got back on the Apple bandwagon with an iPhone 8 (which has been great), and decided while I'm at it I might as well pick up some AirPods since everyone seems to rave about them (I know, not everyone, but generally speaking). \n\nI've been using them pretty much constantly for the last few days and have some thoughts on them. First, my typical use cases are listening to music at home (though I usually use speakers there), commuting to work on the bus/train, and listening to music at work. So with that out of the way here are my thoughts.\n\nComfort: Excellent. I'm one of the lucky people whose ears these fit very well. Hardly notice them at all even after extended use. They will occasionally get a little loose if I've been walking/running around a lot, and I have some foam eartips waiting for me at home which will hopefully help a bit with security and isolation, which leads me to..\n\nIsolation: They're earbuds, so, not very good. This is to be expected. I do appreciate being able to hear what's going on around me, even with both in and music playing. While commuting it's definitely a downside, but I usually put them around 70-75% volume and can hear the music just fine. We'll see how much the foam helps with this. \n\nSound quality: This is going to be totally subjective, but I think they sound great. Isolation plays into this heavily, but when the surroundings are quiet enough everything sounds really clear. Lows are punchy enough (though never will be as good as IEMs), mids and highs are clear and voices in songs come through well. \n\nConvenience: Holy crap, so convenient. I'm sure everyone has read this a million times already, but the pairing process is really the best there is. Instantly connects with my phone, and now I can sync them easily with my Macs at home and at work. Taking one out to pause and putting it back to resume is awesome. With iOS11 the double tap feature is much more useful. And this finally brings me to..\n\nSpotify! With Spotify's connect feature and the seamless ability to switch my AirPods between my Mac and my phone it takes 30 seconds or less for me to switch between the two, while continuing to listen to the same song wherever I leave off on the other device. \n\nOverall I really am enjoying them a lot, with the caveat that I hope the foam eartips help somewhat with isolation for commuting. Otherwise they've been great, never had a dropped or spotty connection with my phone or Macs. It has made listening to music anytime, anywhere as easy as it can be (until they somehow get instant, seamless device transitioning). \n\nHopefully someone can find this helpful, or at least something to read while bored at a desk. :)",

If you're like me, and are skeptical of updating to the latest iOS right away, but you hate having to stare at the annoying badge app icon (the little red bubble with a number) on your Settings app you can have it disappear without updating your iOS:\n\n\u2022 Open <Settings > \n\u2022 <General > \n\u2022 <Storage & iCloud Usage > \n\u2022 <Manage Storage> (under the Storage section, not the iCloud section)\n\u2022 A list of all the apps will appear showing their storage size to the right - the iOS update should be listed there with its size.\n\u2022 Click on the iOS update to see details\n\u2022 Click <Delete Update> in red\n\nThe notification bubble should now be gone. \n\nTwo things to know: \n1 - Every few weeks it will show up again, just repeat the steps above. \n2 - If you deleted the update and then changed your mind it's easily recoverable in two ways: you can do it through iTunes on your computer (recommended), or on your iPhone you can just go to Settings > General > Software Update > and by doing this it will prompt you to re-download if you wish (redownloading doesn't mean you have to update, it will just download the update so you can still choose when to actually update to the newer iOS). \n\nHope this helped.

Their phone support says something different every single time I call.\n\nHere are some things I\u2019ve been told about very normal stuff regarding service options for a MacBook Pro mid-2012.\n\n* Phone support can only set up service options. They don\u2019t get the quotes, different prices, or anything.\n\n* Phone support does all in the servicing except perform the actual service. They set up the service, give you the cost, take your info and charge you. You then pay for the shipping to their depot where they only perform the service that was agreed to on the phone and don\u2019t run any diagnostics or check anything else on the computer.\n\n* Phone support told me shipping is free.\n\n* Phone support says the repair center will \u201cexamine\u201d the hardware to make sure the repair is necessary.\n\n* My MacBook Pro is eligible for a free service to the graphics card.\n\n* My MacBook Pro is not eligible for any free graphics card services.\n\n* My MacBook Pro is eligible for a free motherboard replacement.\n\n* My MacBook Pro is not eligible for any free motherboard services.\n\n* Apple Flat-Rate repair does exist.\n\n* Apple Flat-Rate repair does not exist and I must not be remembering correctly about calling Apple and sending Apple a computer 3 years ago to have it serviced for a flat-rate.\n\nBonus: I just went into an Apple store to ask about the iPhone Upgrade program.\n\n* Website says that you receive an unlocked iPhone any time you use the iPhone Upgrade program. (Click through the buy option of the 8, select carrier and then at the end it will say \u201cUnlocked iPhone with [carrier] SIM\u201d right under \u201cchange payment option.\n\n* Sales guy in store told me that it is a locked phone that you cannot change to another carrier.\n\nWhat in the world is up with Apple? Can anyone clarify which of all of this is right?? I\u2019d like to buy the 8 using the iPhone Upgrade Program but I travel internationally a lot so I need it unlocked. It\u2019s honestly such a headache that I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s worth the possibility of it being locked and not being able to use my phone.",

I'm very clueless when it comes to networking stuff.\n\nI'm a bit confused about how Time Machine backups work. Basically, I want to move all my large files from my laptop to the external storage device (movies, photos, music etc.) and free up space by not having those files on my laptop. So I want to use it as an external storage device in that sense. But how would I access those files if I wanted them? Would I just drag and drop them back to my laptop, transferring the whole file? Or could I sort of \"stream\" a movie file from my storage device, even though the file is still on the Hard Drive or Time Capsule, if that query makes sense.\n\nBut I also want to just keep important things like documents etc. on the laptop itself, and intermittently have them backed up to the storage device through Time Machine or whatever.\n\nAnd how exactly do iPhone backups work with either of these devices?\n\nI guess what I'm trying to ask is, can I keep some files on the Time Capsule or Extreme w/HDD, but keep those files OFF my laptop and only drag them back when I want them, whilst simultaneously having local files that I keep on my laptop (documents etc.) that will constantly back up in the background?\n\nAnd how does time machine work with deleted items. What if you accidentally delete something off your laptop and want it back. Does time machine mirror the laptop and also delete it?\n\nStupid questions I know but I'm not very good with these things!\n\nMuch appreciation in advance for any help!\n\n ",

Vodafone told me it's out of warranty as you only get 3 months on refurb model.\n\nIs there anything I can do?

The change leaves ugly empty gray spaces on either side of the keyboard, and I am now left to fat-finger my way through all my typing again, wondering why I am still using this phone.\n\nI simply can't understand why they did this of all things.  All the rest of 11 is awesome!  I love the new Control Center!  I love the shortcuts in messages!  But this was one of the selling points of the Plus line...\n\ntl;dr: the new iOS 11 implements a change in Plus models that removes the Plus sized keyboard completely, with no way to bring it back.

There is no change in the Share Sheet in the iOS 11, at least not any notable change to the visual or functional design. Why is it taking such a long time to open up now? \n\nI\u2019ve been scoffing at the conspiracy that apple intentionally slows down older devices before a new one, and now things are getting more suspicious. I may be completely wrong on the conclusion that nothing major has been changed about the share sheet, please correct me if there are changes, but now many things just get weirdly slow, for example, swiping between pages in Home Screen, it constantly freezes for half a second for no reason, and very often registers one single swipe as two, turning the page twice when I only swiped once. These are things that had no fundamental changes in this version of OS from the previous. \n\nYes I\u2019m aware they would put more focus on new devices and optimize them before the old ones, but there are things in the ios that just don\u2019t have any changes become drastically slow too, I am kinda disappointed how unfinished ios 11 is this time compared to the older ios versions (okay when 7 came out it was a disaster too, but this time it appears to be even worse..)",

It turned on for a while but eventually blanked out. Took it to the local Apple Store for repair and told the Genius Bar associate the complete truth on what happened. She took it to the back and did a quick interior check of my MBP to see any visible corrosion or wet spots, but said she couldn't find any. She was real with me and said it could cost up to $1475 to fix, but she was going to send it up with a flat fee rate to see if they repair guys would do it for that amount, so about $575. \n\n\nI lost my job as a Frontend Dev a few months ago and money is extremely tight, but I need my MBP to bone up on my skills and build up my portfolio to look for new jobs, so it's pretty much a necessity. \n\n\nThe Apple Store contacted me last month, about a week after I dropped it off to tell me I could pick it up. I told them I would need a couple more weeks to save up money to pay for the $575 fee. They said okay, as long as I kept in contact so they wouldn't  consider it as abandoned. \n\n\nI was supposed to pick it up this past Saturday, but I still couldn't afford the $575 fee (rent, food, living, etc). I called the Genius Bar today to inform them I needed about 4 more weeks to get the money needed to pay for the repair. Genius bar associate said to hold while she talked to her admin about how long they can keep a MBP. She came back on the phone and said that it appears that repair bill has already been closed so I can come in and pick it up anytime without paying a fee.  I think to myself \"She probably made a mistake and once I get up there they'll say I have to pay the $575, but might as well drive up and see for sure.\"\n\n\nI get there, talk to an associate and he says to have a seat at the Genius bar and my repaired MBP will be out in 5-10 minutes. I'm still expecting that the $575 charge will still come into play, but the guy hands me my MBP and says \"Is there anything else I could help you with?\" I didn't even have to sign anything. Me, being the curious sort (also the sort to look a gift horse in the mouth because of said curiosity), asked \"Uh... how is this free?\" He looks down at his Ipad and says that the repair account bill has already been closed, so there is no possible way to charge me for anything. I'm astounded, either Apple customer service at this store is stellar, or there was just a mixup in the billing, either way, my logic board, keyboard and lower casing have been replaced and are brand new. \n\n\nMy MBP is a 2013 so it's definitely not covered in Applecare, I know this because last year I had to replace the battery at the very same store and paid full price for the replacement installation.  Pretty damn happy with my Apple experience today.",

I use facebook messenger for video calls and I tend my phone while on the video call. This isn't a problem on the android since it 'resizes' the video call into a pop-up in a corner of the screen but I can't do this on my iPad. Whenever I press the home button I don't see the person whom I am talking to and neither can the other person see me. Instead, it just shows a notification of the call on the top of the screen on the notification bar. \n\n\nIs there any way to get around this?

Also, I read this [article](https://www.windowscentral.com/apple-faceid-vs-windows-hello) but it just describes things already available in Apple's own website.\n\nTo be fair, is it significantly better in Apple's implementation? Apple is known to be able to solve hard problems that other companies haven't been able to crack, but this seems like a small enhancement in what is already a great technology. Maybe they have better machine learning or processing power, but I think it's not as mindblowing or groundbreaking compared to a few of their innovations e.g. the intuitiveness of pairing of W1-powered accessories, or the upcoming AirPower with place-anywhere-on-the-mat capability.",

It's not so horrible as long as my original file is preserved on my computer. \n\n-How does iCloud determine what metadata triggers a match? For example: if I have a track in my library called \"Sonatine for Trombone and Piano\" by composer \"Jacques Casterede,\" will it replace this track with anything it can find on iTunes that matches, even if the album or artist are different? Or would it recognize that this isn't the same track and upload it from my library instead? \n\nI can put up with the inconvenience of the occasionally mismatched track as long as it doesn't change or delete the original file from my computer. But at the same time, with a very unique library of mostly classical music, which includes a lot of live performances, I'd hate to lose access to hundreds of my preferred live versions any time I'm not on my computer. \n\nThanks for any info anyone has about this!

Why is it not syncing across the folders for specifically the last four within the phone settings??? OHHH! It makes me so mad, since iOS 6 there have been so many issues with Photos, with music, with X and Y and Z... Great software makes great hardware great to use.

I clicked the icon and Apple showed a prompt warning me that this app was no longer available on the App Store and would be removed from my phone. I only had one choice...to accept it.\n\nInstead of being able to plug in my iPhone and install the application I recently paid for, I was forced to install the default YouTube application on my phone and lose ProTube forever.\n\nThis is a crappy outcome to this problem. If I purchase an application, Apple should continue hosting the application to those of us who rightfully own it even if the developer removed it from sale. In addition, yanking local syncing functionality out of iTunes puts the fate of the apps installed on our devices solely on Apple's shoulders and the size of our Internet pipe to our homes. If you have a slow connection, restoring a new iPhone takes hours and you're at the whim of whatever apps apple has in its catalogue.\n\nI find the outcome of this very disappointing.

The impact of these horrible events, not just in Las Vegas but also in cities like London, Paris, and Orlando, it resonates with all of us. We can feel their pain, their agony, only imagining their hearts break.\n\n\nAs the sun rises on this October morning, let's live a new day and cherish our lives and those we value in our lives, for evil does not sleep. It is nightmares like these that ultimately bring us together through our greatest fears and we are able to find comfort and solace with each other. And at the end of it all, humanity will be a shining beacon of hope that brings us all together while understanding the reality of what happened.\n\n\nOur country is at our best when we fight through adversity. This is a time that we'll never forget, and that's going to be problematic. But we will band together, we will rebuild, and our country will be stronger than ever.\n\n\nI\u2019ve always looked at Apple as one big family and I encourage you to reach out to your coworkers if they need someone to talk to, not just for this event, but for any problems they may be having with their lives.\n\n\nLet\u2019s be strong\u2014together!\n\nBest, \n\nTim",

            "selftext": "This may be welcome news to folks who rely on SMB quite a bit - I was pleasantly surprised by an unexpected improvement to overall SMB performance with HS. Plenty of lamentation exists about SMB in previous versions of the OS, but I hadn't read anywhere that there were improvements slated for it in HS.\n\nI use SMB quite a bit in my environment and always found that shares would take a very long time to connect, and then a very long time to render the list of contents once a connection was established. Other times, a connection would be established, but the Finder window would be empty as if nothing were there until I clicked the share name again and everything start showing up again. Just generally flaky behavior.\n\nNot sure if this improvement is tied to APFS or updates to Apple's SMB client itself, but it sure was great to see it in any case.",

            "selftext": "Throughout the last eight years, the iOS platform has become gradually more and more bloated and buggy. While app extensions and other improvements in recent years have partially let the app experience catch up with Android, in other ways iOS devices (in software and hardware) have fallen behind, and it really feels like Apple just doesn\u2019t care. As a brief selection of personal examples:\n\n* From iOS 6.x - 9.x it was near impossible to select text on most web pages without causing an unstoppable scroll that often ended in Safari crashing.\n* Spotlight search (since ~iOS 8.x IIRC) suddenly stops working and requires a *full iOS restore without backup* to resolve the issue. (A known issue and the full restore is given on here as a solution, as if it\u2019s totally okay to have to nuke your phone and data to get basic search working!)\n* Apple Maps (in New Zealand, at least) is so bad that it misses entire streets in our largest city. No noticeable improvements since about 2014.\n* Despite Apple\u2019s \u201cefforts\u201d in exposing APIs, Siri cannot integrate with music apps (I use Spotify and Google Music), mapping apps (Waze) or hobbyist home automation systems (unless you use buggy open source hacks, or have iOS 11 and build your own bridge from scratch).\n* CarPlay, similarly, does not support third party maps, or Google Music (Spotify gets in for some reason, though).\n* iCloud has no Linux support, no APIs of any kind, and very poor support of open standards. It makes me feel like Apple has my data (especially photos/videos) hostage.\n\nDespite these many very annoying shortcomings, I\u2019ve stuck with Apple, because their design values have always rung true to what I personally believe consumer electronics should be. Plus I usually find their hardware designs to be superior. However, following the release of the (in my eyes, disappointing and *extremely* overpriced) iPhone X, and the buggy mess that is iOS 11, I am finally leaving Apple.\n\niOS 11 is so bad that I am finding myself barely able to use my phone at all. I have taken to using my iPad instead, because my phone reliably crashes every ~5 minutes of use in any app. I\u2019ve tried a full iOS restore (with restore from backup), which has not helped. I *refuse* to nuke all my data just to get basic functionality working, because that\u2019s an absolutely ridiculous requirement for a supposedly \u201cstable\u201d and \u201cuse friendly\u201d platform.\n\nAs of last week, I\u2019ve switched to an Android Wear 2 Watch to \u201cwean\u201d myself off my Apple Watch, and I\u2019m loving it. Battery life is as good, and it has an always-on OLED display. Some features don\u2019t work (because of poor iOS integration), but all in all it\u2019s a great experience and I\u2019m not missing my Series 0 AW at all.\n\nToday, after rebooting my SE for the sixth time (trying to use Safari, how dare I?!) I have ordered a Samsung Galaxy S8. I know Android is a bit clunkier, and I know there will be some bumps in the road. But by god will it be nice to at least have the opportunity to fix the problems I experience on the S8. I won\u2019t be powerless to do anything like I am currently on iOS. And being able to use the music and mapping services of my choice as first class citizens will be mighty nice too!\n\nI will continue to follow Apple with interest, and respect their design legacy and potential, but I do not expect to be buying another one of their products in a long time, bar perhaps the iPad Pro.",

At the time I bought an iPad Air 2 (16gb), which I still use, and more recently I bought an iPhone SE (64gb). For the longest time I have been wanting to upgrade my iPad to an iPad Pro, 9,7 inch or the new 10.5 for portability purposes (and also correcting the big mistake I made by choosing the 16gb model iPad Air 2) because it has the smart keyboard cover and it would save me some bag space because I could leave my bluetooth keyboard at home. With the introduction of iOS 11 and files, the low storage amount of the iPad blocks my productivity less and less everyday as I keep all things on my 2TB iCloud Drive and iOS does a great job of managing the space and the files I need present (internet connectivity is not an issue) so I started thinking I might get more out of my iPad/iPhone workflow if I were to upgrade the iPhone instead. \n\nI am a writer and use my iPad with Scrivener. I also work with photography for my day job to which I use the iPhone to shoot with, both pictures and moving pictures. I edit them in Affinity Photo. I occasionally do mock ups on Adobe Comp and work a lot in Excel and Word. \n\nI am really stumped over what my next move should be and although, on the one hand, I feel that I don\u2019t really need an upgrade, on the other I am about to hit my 2 year mark since I quit smoking and I am a firm believer in self gratification to keep me going. That being said, I also don\u2019t want to buy something just because I want it, I want to maximize the potential of my next Apple product and that will depend largely on making this decision.\n\nGiven all of this, would you upgrade the iPhone of the iPad?\n\nThank you all for your help!",

In the past they've been solid. This changed the whole risk calculation for me on when to upgrade Mac OS. I think I'll wait for 10.x.1 from now on.\n\nTip for Apple: If you're making a recovery tool, maybe you should check for \"impossible\" situations, like no hard disks to install to in a laptop you made, and admit to the user that something is wrong. WTF, Apple. Useless.\n\nTL;DR: If all else fails, Option-Command-R to install from the network, and view partitions that don't mount automatically in Disk Utility until they magically do.\n\nEdit: Wording",

It's been laggy and buggy with frequent crashes. I've had to factory reset it several times since May and nothing has fixed it. This morning it finally decided to commit suicide and it bricked. I've contacted my phone company and the SE is the device that is in my price range and based on testimony from iPhone-owning friends, motherboards going is not an issue I have to worry about anymore.\n\nSo I just had some questions: \n\nHow easy is the switch to iOS from Android (this will be the first Apple device I've ever owned)?\n\nHow long will the SE be supported by Apple?\n\nAre there any issues with the phones that I should be aware of?\n\nUpdate: I got several PMs from people who own iPhone SE devices.

At this point I has already contacted the seller regarding a refund, and he said that as it runs an older version of MacOS (Mavericks according to the ebay post, although I obviously can't confirm that), that it would need an update for HDMI to work. I then tried the thunderbolt (i think?) to DVI adaptor that came with it, and added a DVI to VGA adaptor, and still no luck either with any of my screens. I have tried other solutions found on google but no joy. Maybe a fried logic board?\n\n\nIt seems to switch on (the little white LED comes on) but I don't hear any sort of chime, is that normal?\n\n\nThanks in advance \n\n  ",

            "selftext": "Apple has always shared the kernel of macOS after each major release. This kernel also runs on iOS devices as both macOS and iOS are built on the same foundation. This year, Apple also shared the most recent version of the kernel\u00a0on GitHub. And you can also find\u00a0ARM versions\u00a0of the kernel for the first time.\n\nBut first, it\u2019s time for some computer history. The first version of macOS (originally named Mac OS X) came out in 2001. It was built on top of\u00a0NeXTSTEP, an operating system developed by NeXT. Steve Jobs founded NeXT in 1985 and sold the company back to Apple in 1997. And Apple decided to use NeXTSTEP as the foundation for Mac OS X.\n\nNeXTSTEP itself is derived from open-source project BSD. That\u2019s why the Mac you might be currently using relies heavily on open-source technologies. And that\u2019s also why Apple releases a tiny, tiny portion of macOS every year. You can\u2019t compile it and run your own version of macOS, but other kernel developers probably care about the source code of this kernel.\n\nWhat about iOS? When Steve Jobs\u00a0first introduced\u00a0the iPhone in 2007, he said that the operating system of the iPhone is a macOS fork. \u201cToday, we\u2019re going to show you a software breakthrough. Software that is at least 5 years ahead on what\u2019s on any other phone. Now how did we do this? Well, we started with a strong foundation \u2014 iPhone runs OS X,\u201d Jobs said. \u201cWhy would we want such a sophisticated operating system on a mobile device? Because it\u2019s got everything we need.\u201d\n\nApple later called this operating system iPhone OS, and then iOS. It\u2019s not an exact copy as there are no floating windows on iOS. But iOS and macOS use the same Unix-based core named\u00a0Darwin as well as many frameworks. The Apple Watch and the Apple TV also run variants of iOS that also rely on Darwin.\n\nSo the fact that you can now download ARM-optimized source code of Apple\u2019s kernel doesn\u2019t mean much. Maybe Apple wants to share the kernel of the iPhone to get feedback from the open-source community. Maybe it means that Apple is working on a version of macOS that runs on ARM chips. Maybe it was an accident. Maybe Apple just wanted to see the reaction on Twitter.\n\n",

            "selftext": "[ Crossposted to relevant iDevice and IOS subs ]\n\nI recently went ahead with the IOS 11.0.1 update on my iPod Touch 6. I had a backup of the iPod on my computer that I'd made on 9/23 (when it was running IOS 10.3.3), so even though I wasn't expecting any problems I was confident I could deal with them if they came up.\n\nThe update went off without a hitch, but I was surprised to find just how many 32-bit apps I'd be losing forever -- including some I'm not willing to let go of just yet. So I decided to try downgrading back to 10.3.3, using [this procedure outlined by OS X Daily](http://osxdaily.com/2017/09/20/downgrade-ios-11-to-ios-10-iphone-ipad/). The downgrade also appeared to go off without a hitch. However, as it was progressing I realized I wasn't entirely comfortable with what might result from just \"updating\" to a former version of IOS, so I decided that after it was done it would be better to do a full recovery and restore from my old 10.3.3 backup from 9/23.\n\nThis is when I discovered that the downgrade procedure had apparently caused my 9/23 backup to be overwritten with a *new* backup from after the downgrade (!!?!?) -- so now I had no 10.3.3 backup from before the 11.0.1 upgrade. Still, I was hopeful I could just reload 10.3.3, restore from this new 10.3.3 backup, and everything would be ok.\n\nIt wasn't. After reloading 10.3.3 and restoring from the new backup the iPod was seriously unstable. Some of the problems I saw:\n\n1. After running various apps (current/updated apps, not 32-bit) the iPod would freeze -- neither the Home nor the Sleep/Wake buttons would work and often the app itself wouldn't work either. The iPod would eventually crash and restart. This was a show-stopper, of course.\n2. When I connected the iPod to my Macbook Pro it would usually show up in iTunes with all the space listed as \"Other\" and the Sync button greyed out (but other times it would show up normally and allow me to Sync)\n3. Many of the apps I'd had were missing and I had to restore them manually through the App Store\n4. The 17 notes I had in the Notes app had all disappeared\n\nI tried redoing the recovery/restore procedure several times using the new backup, and each time the iPod misbehaved in these same ways. So it seemed clear that whatever was causing the problems had been stored in that new backup (hey, wonderful!). I tried several other recovery/restore variations at this point in the vain hope that I wasn't just stuck with a broken device and a corrupt backup, but nothing worked. So at this point I had a broken device and no good backup of my 10.3.3 iPod.\n\nFortunately, a) I just got this iPod in May to replace an iPod 4 running IOS 6, b) I hadn't made a lot of changes to it since then, and c) the iPod 4 backup from May hadn't been molested by the upgrade/downgrade procedure. So I reinstalled IOS 10.3.3, restored from the May IOS 6 backup, reinstalled the few apps I'd bought since then...and it now looks like things are stable. Other than a lot of lost progress in a few games I'd bought I'm more or less whole again.\n\nSo a few lessons I've learned that I'll share with anyone considering an update to 11.0.1 who thinks there's any chance they might want to downgrade to 10.3.3 afterwards (and while this all happened on an iPod Touch I'd expect it could happen on other iDevices as well):\n\n- **AN ITUNES BACKUP OF YOUR IDEVICE IS NOT ENOUGH**, because the update/downgrade procedure may irrevocably destroy your on-disk backup. So in addition to sync'ing the device in iTunes you should **make a backup of the resulting backup** (e.g. with Time Machine) before performing the 11.0.1 update.\n- Make sure you [download a copy of the IOS 10.3.3 IPSW file for your device](http://osxdaily.com/2017/07/19/ios-10-3-3-download-update-ipsw/) prior to updating to 11.0.1, just to be 100% sure it'll be available if you need it.\n- Generally speaking, treat the 11.0.1 update as a major event or you may find yourself in a world of pain.\n\n\nHopefully this saves someone from dealing with the data loss and multi-day hassle I just went through.\n\n---\n\n**TL;DR**: Updating to IOS 11.0.1 and then downgrading to 10.3.3 both hosed my iPod Touch *and* destroyed my last good backup of that iPod Touch (making it impossible to recover to that backup). I was only able to recover thanks to a 5-month old backup of my former iPod. Don't assume that a sync of your iDevice is enough to take you back to 10.3.3 if things go south -- **back up your backup**.",

Seriously, the function is there, you just need to add a button. How simple is that? Shaking the device is just stupid, you can\u2019t do this discreetly, it\u2019s not comfortable.\n\n\u201eShake to undo\u201d shoud be nice addition, not the only way to undo things.\n\nPS I know I can use 3rd party apps.

            "selftext": "I\u2019ve noticed that as Apple has released great new products like the Apple Watch and AirPods, we\u2019ve started to see a lot of duplication in functionality. There are many features and functions now that can be carried out in multiple places.\n\nFor example:\n\n1. **I want to check the weather today.** Do I open the weather app? Do I 3D Touch the app icon and see the weather widget? Do I slide over to the left to see the weather widget on the widget screen? Do I go into the weather app on my Apple Watch? Do I check the weather Complication on my Watch? That\u2019s 5 separate ways to check the weather.\n\n2. **I want to verbally send a text message.** Do I open the Messages app on my phone and dictate? Do I open Messages on my Watch and dictate? Do I invoke Siri?\n\n3. **I want check the baseball scores.** Do I open an app on my phone? Do I open an app on my Watch? Do I check a Watch Complication? Do I slide down on my phone\u2019s Home screen to get to the Siri search (formerly called Spotlight)? Do I invoke Siri? \nAnd speaking of Siri:\n\n4. **I want to use Siri for any number of tasks.** Do I hold the Home button on my iPhone? Do I say \u201cHey Siri\u201d to my iPhone? Do I hold the Digital Crown on my Watch? Do I say \u201cHey Siri\u201d to my Watch? Do I tap the icon on my Siri watch face? Do I double tap my AirPods? That\u2019s at least 6 ways to invoke Siri.\n\nMy point is that there are **A LOT** of different ways to accomplish the same task in Apple\u2019s ecosystem. You might argue that this gives the user choice, but I would argue that it\u2019s actually detrimental because it increases the *cognitive load*. **The user wants to accomplish a certain task; she doesn\u2019t want to have to think about and decide between the many different ways to accomplish said task. She just wants it done.**\n\nThis is a difficult design problem to solve because you don\u2019t want to artificially limit the capabilities of each device, but at the same time, you don\u2019t want too much redundancy. The goal is to create an ecosystem in which every task can be accomplished simply and without thought. **You want all the devices to be powerful and capable. but you also want to instill muscle memory into the user so that he automatically knows which device and method to use for what, without having to make a conscious choice.** After all, too much choice can actually slow down your task. Choice [paralysis](https://www.ted.com/talks/barry_schwartz_on_the_paradox_of_choice) is a real thing.\n\n**So what\u2019s the solution?**\n\nI believe that in order to solve this, we\u2019ll need a massive paradigm shift in computing. We\u2019ll need to see a shift away from the current app-based paradigm to a more function-based paradigm. Instead of thinking *\u201cuse this app to do X\u201d* or *\u201cuse this device to accomplish Y\u201d*, you have to essentially reverse that and put the task ahead of the entry point. *\u201cI want to do X\u201d*.\n\nI think we\u2019ve seen hints of that in certain places. For example, look at the Maps app that was redesigned in iOS 10. Previously, the app was a collection of features. It had different options for different things. If you wanted driving direction, you\u2019d tap one thing. If you wanted to search for a place, you\u2019d tap another thing. And so on. That\u2019s all well and good, but when you\u2019re opening a Maps app, the primary thing you have in mind is *\u201cHow do I get there\u201d*? iOS 10 did that. The UI change in the Maps app from [iOS 7/8/9](https://cdn.cultofmac.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/turn-by-turn-maps-ios-7.jpg) to [iOS 10](http://images.techhive.com/images/article/2016/09/ios10_maps_destinations-100683165-large.png) was far more than aesthetic. It redesigned the interface to put your task in the forefront. You\u2019d get directions, and then if you wanted to change how you get there, you can play with the features. But the point is that it puts the task in front of the options instead of the options in front of the task.\n\nAnother example of this is how the Maps app now integrates Uber. If I want to Uber somewhere, instead of going to the Uber app, I once again use the Maps app and think *\u201cI want to get there\u201d*, at which point the Uber option is available via the newly added extension. The Uber app is no longer the focus. The *\u201cI want to get there\u201d* is, and Uber is merely one of the means through which to get there.\n\n**That\u2019s the kind of paradigm shift we need to see.** The Maps app redesign was great, but we need to see a whole lot more of that design philosophy elsewhere. We need to see the focus pulled away from the apps and devices and access points, and shifted towards the task at hand. This is a monumental design challenge that will require the best design minds in software and hardware to take a step back and rethink things from the ground up, but if any company can do it, it's Apple. Now that we\u2019re seeing the voice-first world start to emerge, along with the birth of identity computing (thanks to Face ID), I think and I hope we\u2019re on the precipice of this major paradigm shift.",

My question is the following and aimed at people with newer iphones bought sim-free (7 or 8):\n\nI have read that cellular service companies will block certain features from phones that weren't purchased from them (AKA locked to them) such as wifi calling or visual voicemail. Maybe others. I actually experienced this with my GS7 bought from AT&T. As soon as i went through the unlocking process with them, those features were shut down when I went to Tmobile. Thats when I went to search online and found others with similar accounts. For those of you who bought sim-free, did you see any features not work with your phone? Did you talk to their customer service to figure out why? Do some carriers do this and not others?\n\nThank you in advance for your responses.\n",

I remove the plug before I go to bed after charging it to at least 90% every night.\n\nBefore I go to sleep at bed I use the phone for at max an hour. Usually I watch YouTube videos, Twitch streams, read a bunch of articles etc. The surprising part is that when i wake up, the battery is around 50%-60% even though I had left it at around 85% when I slept. I found out from the battery status that YouTube (and even Twitch sometimes) were working on the background while I was sleeping. I did the same thing a couple of times and it was consistently draining the battery. So to fix this, I kill the YouTube and Twitch every night before I go to sleep. It stopped draining battery overnight and I have around 85% battery to spend the next day while returning at home with 50%.\n\nThis didn't happen on iOS `10.x`. So to anyone having battery issues with iOS `11.x`, it's best to kill (YouTube, Twitch or probably apps that use audio/video) when you are not going to use it or even before you lock screen your phone.\n",

            "selftext": "The versions of iOS have always been fine for me in the past, just with minor bugs. iOS 11 is by FAR the worst upgrade for me, here's my experiences:\n\n- Huge increase in the rate of apps and the whole OS freezing. This used to happen very occasionally on iOS 10 but now it\u2019s happening several times a day and is incredible irritating, especially when I need to just quickly check my phone for something and it ends up taking maybe 5 minutes instead of 5 seconds by the time my phone reboots etc.\n- Volume controls don\u2019t work. Sometime they do, but usually not. This is both for the buttons and headphone controls. I am currently getting around this by using the control centre. However, I can\u2019t change the ringer volume this way so I have no way other than going into the settings every time I want to adjust that.\n- When I have music playing on Spotify, on the control centre it still shows controls for the \u2018music\u2019 app. This, combined with the headphone controls not working, means the only way I can pause/skip etc is to go into the actual app each time. \n- Huge delays when I press buttons. For example ocassionally when I press pause or control the volume from my headphones it will decide to work, but only do what I wanted after a huge delay. \n- After turning airplane mode on then back off, Bluetooth is now even if it wasn\u2019t before I turned airplane mode on. But I understand this could be intentional? \n\n\nI really hope apple will fix these bugs asap. I've experienced many others but these are just the ones most annoying. \n\nEdit: I have an iPhone 6. However, many people have also commented saying they're getting the same issues on a 6S or a 7.",

However, then I tried closing Tinder from the multi-tasking screen, and everything was working again as usual.\n\nTDLR: Tinder destroyed iOS11 on my SE. Closing it from the multi-tasking screen solved everything. If you're a user of Tinder and iOS11 and suffering, try what I did.",

I hope to raise awareness since there are times when Siri is useful but its use is inappropriate or potentially embarrassing.\n\nTo activate (tested on iPhone 7+):\n\n1. Activate Siri by holding the Home button\n2. Raise the phone to ear\n3. If you can see the corner of the screen, wait until it goes dark (or wait a couple of seconds) for iOS to detect it is in handset mode\n4. Issue the command and wait for the audio response. Siri will respond in handset mode instead of using the speakerphone.\n\nSiri Voice Feedback must be set to either Always On or Control with Ring Switch (and the switch set to Ring, of course) for this to work.\n\nI often use this feature to send text messages to my wife, and to ask the time of my next meeting while walking to my desk. It is not perfect--Siri does not correctly process the follow-up commands--but it could still be helpful.",

After looking into the issue, apparently this is in an attempt to prevent people from using non-local stores.  In my opinion, this approach is quite misguided. I know I could just have the US/UK site side by side with the local one and generally figure out what I am buying, but that is not only a sub-par solution, it doesn't solve the most annoying part. The apple store, siri, iTunes, etc are useless unless I have them set to the US or UK but then as I lack an address or bank card in either country I would not be permitted to make purchases.\n\ntl;dr\nCan't select language on apple.com or on apple store without then losing the ability to purchase and ship to my address.

The guy who gave it to me said this was the first of the new model they had sold out of the store, since it had been refreshed like 3 days before. About a year later it started acting really weird and i took it in the Genius said the processor went bad, so they replaced the motherboard, and it ran great for a while! Then I bought an Apple Thunderbolt display second hand from someone and went to go test it out and found that my thunderbolt ports were lose! So they replaced the motherboard a second time! then it worked great for a while until i managed to burn out my graphics card.. this time the apple care had run out by 24 days, but they still were awesome enough to replace the motherboard for free for a third time!(They give you another 30 days of warranty after a repair) And then i updated to high sierra like 10 days later and it crashed my system again, the entire mac side of my computer had been deleted and only bootcamp was left over (I successfully made a MacBook Windows haha). So I went to the apple store and they fixed it and while i was setting it up again i was using headphones in the headphone port and noticed the port was loose again, siri would start going off and music was being played and paused and the genius at the bar said that they'll have to replace the motherboard again and i was like damn, this will be the 4th time! and he looked at the history of the computer and confirmed it, and said he'd be right back and went into the back of the store, then he came out with the manager and said that they were going to go ahead and take the computer back from me as a return and exchange it for the brand new 2017 MacBook Pro 15' with 4 GB of Radeon graphics!!!! THEY REPLACED MY COMPUTER WITH ONE 3 YEARS NEWER!!! \n\nI will forever buy apple care and be part of the apple cult, they're customer service is beyond anything I've ever seen from any company!",

It does not happen with other apps and sources.\n\nI use optical cable from the tv to the receiver, the apple tv has ethernet cable with 30/30 fiber connection, and i live in norway.\n\nI am hoping this is some issue with apple which will be solved, but I am also thinking of the possiblility it could be the tv.\nAny one had with similar problems or any insights?\nThank you!",

It's just a short interview of perhaps three to four questions that could possibly be exchanged through email or reddit, nothing more.\n\nYou don't have to be directly working under Apple, in fact, it will be better if you are someone involved in the production process such as the creative team, or if you are employed in one of several companies producing the different components of Apple tech. \n\nInitially, I thought the most suitable interviewee for this was an employee working under the various factories making spare parts for an iPhone, but I haven't been able to connect with anyone on the forums where Chinese factory employees lurk...so I'm changing my target audience and trying my luck here.\n\nNot sure how feasible this is, but hopefully someone can help.

            "selftext": "I was having some thoughts about what kind of screen resolution Apple could use on a future plus sized iPhone X. Since the iPhone X is the first Apple 3x display, it is interesting to think whether they would use 3x, 4x, or 6x downsampled 1.15 (like the current plus iPhones). Those resolutions would be (PPI at a 6.8in screen):\n\n* iPhone X: 1125 x 2436 (PPI: 462)\n* 1x: 414 x 896 (same proportions roughly as iPhone X)\n* 3x: 1242 x 2688 (PPI: ~435)\n* 4x: 1656 x 3584 (PPI: ~580)\n* 5x: 2070 x 4480 (PPI: ~725)\n* 6x: 2484 x 5382 (PPI: ~871)\n* 6x downsampled 1.15: 2160 x 4680 (PPI: 758)\n\n*note, for 6x I used 414 x 897 as this provides a perfect downsampled 1.15 resolution*\n\nA reason I could see them using a 6x 1.15 downsample would be for VR. Even with an OLEDs subpixel arrangements, it would be really crisp up close. It would also be easy to market as '4K Ultrawide' or some other use of '4K', as it has the same vertical resolution (2160p) as 4k. Maybe 'Super Retina 4K'.\n\n6x would be extremely taxing on the GPU, rendering pre downsample 4.88x more pixels than the new iPhone X. If we use the current 8/8+, the 8+ renders 2.74x more pixels per frame. Using that scale on the X, the X+ resolution would end up between 4x and 5x.\n\nA 4x resolution would then be the most logical from a GPU resourcing standpoint, as the pixel count between X and X+ would be lower than between 8 and 8+, by scale.\n\nApple could go for near GPU processing parity with a 3x resolution with no downsampling, but would end up in a situation where the smaller (and presumably cheaper) X phone has a higher PPI. Based on that alone, a 4x resolution is more likely.\n\nAlso on a different note, I think Apple won't introduce a X+ until they can rebrand the entire iPhone lineup back to straight 'iPhone, iPhone Plus', with the year being added onto the end (iPhone SE 2018, iPhone 2018, iPhone Plus 2018).

In short, it's kind of a money pit.\nb) It's big, and I don't want to feel \"locked in\" with a bigger size iPhone, which is always more expensive.\n\nOn the other hand, here's the good things about the 8+:\n\na) Portrait mode on the camera and overall a very good camera.\nb) 3GB of RAM. iOS 11 practically screams on this thing.\nc) More screen real estate for me (not that important, but nice to have).\nd) Excellent battery life. My 6s would've been at 30% or so when my 8+ was at 65-70%.\n\nIf I exchange the 8+ to a 8, I'd get $100 dollars back (I paid full retail price straight from Apple, no monthly bs for me), but I'm already feeling weird using my old 6s screen because it feels so small in comparison, but it's also easier on my hands. I love the better camera, but honestly, how often would I need to use portrait mode?\n\nAlso, I was thinking about maybe just reverting back to my 6s completely and waiting until next year (returning the 8+ and essentially paying $0 this year for an iPhone), as there's not THAT much difference between the 6s and 8 (non-plus), but my 6s is feeling slower, even with a fresh install, and iOS 11 just doesn't run great on it.\n\nDecisions, decisions. I'm really not sure what to do or what the best solution would be. I have only a few days to make my final decision (14-day return/exchange policy), so... help!

(Compatible with Core 2 Duo, Xeon, i3, i5, i7 processors or better)\n\nSeveral Macs whose processors are on that list and worked in 8 no longer work in 10. There is an [article in their knowledge base](https://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&cmd=displayKC&externalId=2005196) that gives a more detailed list of which Macs are supported.\n\nThat knowledge base article says:\n\n\u2022 All Macs launched in 2011 or later are supported except:  \n2012 Mac Pro \u201cQuad Core\u201d using the Intel\u00ae Xeon\u00ae W3565 Processor.\n\n\u2022 In addition the following are supported:  \n2010 Mac Pro \u201cSix Core\u201d, \u201cEight Core\u201d and \u201cTwelve Core\u201d.\n\nUnfortunately, there is nothing on the Fusion upgrade page that points to that knowledge base page.\n\nWhen you try to start a VM and your CPU is one of the ones no longer supported, you get an error that says:\n\n    This host does not support virtualizing real mode.\n\n    The Intel \"VMX Unrestricted Guest\" feature is\n    necessary to run this vritual machine on an Intel\n    processor.\n\n    Module 'CPUIDEarly' power on failed.\n\n    Failed to start the virtual machine.\n\nThere is a discussion of this on the VMWare forums [here](https://communities.vmware.com/message/2707968#2707968). It apparently can be made to work on the older processors if you add the line\n\n    monitor.allowLegacyCPU = \"true\"\n\nto your configuration file, but it also stops working if some other settings are changed so this is probably at best just a temporary workaround.\n\nTo revert to 8, it appears that all you have to do is run the 8 installer. You don't appear to need to uninstall 10 first.\n\nHowever, if you updated any of your 8 VMs to 10 format, they will no longer run in 8.
