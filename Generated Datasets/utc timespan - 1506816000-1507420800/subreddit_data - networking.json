Perhaps somebody here can help.\n\nOriginal situation: pfSense with a public IP WAN, a routed public subnet to DMZ, LAN with a /24 from RFC1918.\n\nChange required: need to connect to corporate mothership by direct fiber. Mothership hogs entire RFC1918 but luckily/gracefully our LAN /24 could be liberated/was not in use, so no need for renumbering on our end.\n\nCurrent situation 1: built an SFP L2 link (trunk, via VLAN) by means of an existing 3com switch capable of a few static routes, made L3 static routes for RFC1918 to hand off to motherships's core switch, made 3Com and pfSense (default gateway) routes to talk to each others. Seemed to be working (not entirely sure, no time to test thoroughly) but had to be scrapped because there was no way to do traffic filtering. The 3Com ACLs were really really retarded. Do not want to go that route. \n\nProposed workaround: keep the switch do the routing stuff, put up a real firewall to filter in transparent mode between the switch and the mothership core switch. Ordered firewall, order got canceled. Reordered. Firewall arrived two weeks too late. So not an option at this time.\n\nCurrent situation 2, aka half-assed fill the gap: Deconfigured 3Com switch and disconnected the fiber, plunked in an EdgeRouter X SFP as L2 SFP fiber connection, configured routes for the RFC1918 space and configured test systems to use it as a default gateway on the local /24. Added a route to DMZ for the pf as gateway.\n\nResult: if I make system on a LAN use the EdgeRouter as default gateway I can reach everything (access to /24 LAN is already local, routing to DMZ is handed off to pfSense, the RFC1918 is handed off to the mothership core switch).\n\nProblem: systems which use the EdgeRouter as DG no longer have access to the Internet.\n\nBefore I screw up everything remotely by trying to handle off the routes to the pfSense, and keep all systems on the pfSense LAN as DG, is there a temporary fix to make the Ubiquiti handle off everything but RFC1918 space to the pfSense?\n\nI guess I could try to do something like https://serverfault.com/questions/304781/cidr-ranges-for-everything-except-rfc1918 with the EdgeRouter, but I don't have any clue nor time (this needs to work by tomorrow, latest by Monday) to create a network alias for that space.\n\nAny other suggestions?

Here is the gist of it:\n\nWithin our core network, we have two exit points to our enterprise network. One on the east coast, and one on the west coast. We use ASR's for these exit points that peer up (bgp) with the p2p on the other side through the firewall. \n\nThese exit points are redundant paths for learned routes from the enterprise networks. I'm trying to set it so that if someone is located on the east coat, they go out the east coast exit point and vice versa for west coast. We have a network learned, let's just say 10.100.112.0/24 but when one of our testers tried to hit a host on that network, it goes out the west coast. It even traverses THROUGH the east coast router. \n\nAny help would be appreciated. \n\nThank you. \n",

We are using a Comcast modem/router which is connected to a 24 port unmanaged switch providing connectivity to our file server and workstations. We use a dental software(Dentrix) which stores a database on our file server, however, when we have an outage, we cannot access this data via our LAN connection. I'm not too familiar with networking, but is this because when the router is down, there is nothing assigning IP's to the computers? To fix this, can I configure our file server to act as a DHCP server when the router is down, so we still have LAN connectivity?\n \nI'd greatly appreciate the help\n \n",

The two sites are connected via a 1Gbps CenturyLink point to point ethernet circuit. It's about ~50ms ping on an average day between the two sites. They're mostly using Windows file shares and moving files anywhere from 500M to 20G or (cringe) copy/pasting files into RDP windows and I'm leaning toward this being the cause. I know SMB doesn't do very well over high latency links. The users are only getting 2-4 MBytes/sec and are blaming the network. I am leaning toward blaming their choice of storage protocol. I need to prove that there is nothing wrong with the network, as I'm only seeing about 20% utilization across the wan link.

            "selftext": "Back in May my boss and I upgraded our Aruba wireless infrastructure from 6.x to 8.x. After experiencing a ton of bugs and working with support we finally patched everything to 8.1.0.3 (latest as far as I know) last night. We have a single Mobility Master with two controllers in a cluster. Im sure that Im just working out the kinks and I have been learning a TON because of this project, but I was wondering what peoples experience has been with it so far/any tips.\n\nIm currently looking out for good training from Aruba on the 8.x code but all the training I have found has been simple stuff like \"set up and configure a basic Aruba WLAN\" (which I can already do...). Two examples of big issues we had were: Using the Migration Tool to upgrade our system. Nothing was working properly after the upgrade finished so I ended up having to rebuild the system from scratch. After comparing the config that the Migration Tool made and the config that I had built from scratch, there were tons of important configs missing from the Migration Tool config. The other example is the reason we upgraded last night... The controller was dropping the DHCP \"Acknowledge\" packet because it felt like it and users were unable to obtain an IP address (This issue was posted as a known issue in the release notes but we had not experienced it until the past weekend. I should have fought harder to upgrade earlier but my boss wasn't willing to risk another issue after an upgrade without a scheduled break (we are a school)).\n\nSo in short, any good training resources for 8.x? What are your experiences so far with 8.x?\n\nEdit: Just found a class for SWDI (Scalable WLAN Design and Implementation) v8, which seems to be what I am looking for in training. Ill be signing up for that ASAP!",

I could probably fit the storage and the revenue requirement in a single MLAG and use 2 ports but my gut feeling says physical separation at the host is best (any opinions on that are welcome!).  \n  \nI have the choice of using Dell S4148F-ON switches with 48 x 10GigE SFP+ ports and attaching the servers via DAC, or I can go for the S4148T-ON switches with 10GigE BASE-T and attach the servers using standard Cat6a with RJ45 plugs.  \nThe main benefit of the latter is that I get to cut the cables to length and then subsequently post the completed project to /r/cableporn  \nDAC cables, however, come in prefabricated lengths of 0.5m,1m,3m,5m or 7m and obviously it's not as manageable as Cat6a.  \n  \nThe only difference I can see with using one type of media over the other is latency and even then we're talking \u00b5secs, according to Wikipedia.  \n\nWhat would /r/networking do?\n\n**Update:** Huge thank you to all of you for the in depth responses. Clearly we have a winner and we'll be deploying the S4148F-ON switches and using DAC to all servers.  \nWe'll try and find some vertical cable management too.  \nWe have a fair amount of older servers that have 1000 BASE-T which we'll confine to a couple of older S3048-ON switches with standard copper.   \n\nTIL: 10G BASE-T means high power and high temperatures. Found a diagram of the Intel X710 10G BASE-T daughter card and sure enough, big ass heat sink.   \nAlso the BASE-T model of the S41xx series switches from Dell are only available as 24 port due to the power restrictions according to our SE.   \n\nAlso I'm going to try and break my habit of meticulously hand making patch cables and start stocking up on various lengths.  \n\nThis is why I love Reddit :) ",

We have ~20,000 hosts/sites around the state.\n\nThis makes analyzing log files kind of tedious - as it's not really handy to have to cross reference IP addresses when a nice sweet descriptive hostname would be more preferable.\n\nOur statewide internal nets are spread across 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, and 192.168.0.0/16 which are all subnetted out, mostly as /24's but also lots of /27's and /29's.\n\nAll hostnames are in one giant forward zone file on our BIND server. But no reverse lookup file has ever been made.\n\nIs there any good automated way to generate a bunch of reverse zonefiles for our nets?\n\nWhat are some good strategies to organize the zonefiles?  Should I use includes so the smaller subnets can be managed more concisely? Or should I define separate zonefiles in named.conf for every reverse zone?  For example if I did 10.0.0.0/8 as one giant reverse zone, I would use $ORIGIN 10.IN-ADDR.ARPA. The computer with hostname pc1.myorg.org with IP address 10.1.2.3 would have a line in the reverse zone as such:\n\n3.2.1   IN   PTR   pc1.myorg.org.\n\nAnd so forth.\n\nI am exploring the idea of using subdomains for the various departments and operations for the organization (eg. it.myorg.org, engr.myorg.org, admin.myorg.org, etc.)\n\nI tried a python script from (https://gist.github.com/pklaus/2016269) but it threw errors and I could not get it to work.",

            "selftext": "Hello /r/networking - I've recently moved from a helpdesk role into a junior sysadmin. I'm having a hard time understanding network speed throughput.\n\nI understand the basics of a 1Gb switch, passing thru to other 1Gb switches, and workstations receiving at 1Gb but what happens when we start introducing devices that can deal with speeds faster than 1Gb?\n\nSCENARIO 1: Lets say we have an iSCSI SAN connected to a 1GB switch. The VMware servers are 10Gb virtual Ethernet adapters. If I'm migrating data from VM to VM... because the switch and datastore resides on iSCSI... I'm still being throttled to 1Gb completely correct?\n\nSCENARIO 2: If I had 10Gb SFPs in a core switch and 10Gb SFP in a workstation switch, but all Ethernet ports and devices connected to those switches are 1Gb... does the 10Gb connectivity between switches do me any good?\n\nPiggybacking off that last scenario... say I have a portchannel setup between two 1Gb switches. Does the extra 2Gb, 4Gb, whatever it may be between the two switches help at all or does it not matter as my end devices are still receiving at only 1Gb? Or are all these scenarios only improvements based on the actual traffic type and bottleneck?\n\nThank you all. I look forward to picking up my first Cisco routing book and learning more.",

They seem to be advertised as Layer 2... So if I understand correctly, to put it really briefly, the PTP connection between the two antennas would emulate a good ol' ethernet cable ? \nMeaning, let say I have a device with 10.10.20.30/24 connected to the Slave antenna, and a device with 10.10.20.31/24 connected to the Master antenna, they would be able to ping each other directly (Assuming the antennas and PTP connection is working fine) ?\n\nMeaning both sides of the antenna needs to be in the same subnet to be reachable ? (Unless of course a router is involved in the topology at some point)\n\nThank you !",

I drew out a crude map to show the current topology. [here](https://i.imgur.com/UABlKz3.png) I was planning on setting up a LACP between the CORE switch and the branch switch, the routers acting as transparent firewalls running Cloudrouter / fastnetmon. The goal of this project would be to stop a DDOS directed at a single IP from taking down the entire network. Is there any better way of accomplishing this than what I have with the current hardware (1 x LB4M, 2 x LB6Ms, 2 x dedicated servers acting as routers with 2 x 10Gbps ports)  If any clarification needed feel free to ask (I'm not the best with networking / networking terminology) \n\n PS: I do realize since 20.30.40.0/24 is routed to the Juniper, if the attack goes over 100Gbps or gets near it the network will go down. We usually get hit by an 8 - 15Gbps DDOS one to two times a month, the biggest being 25Gbps in size. ",

With every other occurrence I've seen, when a modem loses power, the Gig interface goes down.

            "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nWe're a school district with around 180 Meraki MR34 and MR42 WAPs. This is an established network; we've had the same WiFi infrastructure for about four years without any problems.\n\nWe broadcast two SSIDs. The first is for district-issued domain devices, which authenticate via 802.1x certificates. The second is for non-Windows devices, authenticating with MAC addresses. (Yes, we know this isn't that secure but it's an isolated network.) Both authentication methods are validated by Windows Network Policy Server.\n\nSince school started a few weeks ago, we have one classroom that, during *one single period of the day*, has terrible wireless connectivity to the point of it being unusable. There are roughly 25 kids simultaneously using Dell 3160 laptops. The laptops have been tested elsewhere and are fine.\n\nWe've packet captured the wireless traffic and see a ton of retrasmitted packets. The Meraki logs sometimes show single device packet floods, and other times do not, even when the problem is occurring.\n\nWe don't have anything fancy to monitor RF but we do see an unidentified WiFi signal using WEP, which is not us, as we do not use WEP anywhere. Due to the building's construction it seems unlikely that this is a signal from outside as it wouldn't be strong enough to register. The WEP signal seems strongest at the WAP.\n\nThis led us to believe the WAP went bad, but we swapped it out with no change in behavior.\n\nWe're at a loss as to even what our next step should be. Everything points to RF interference coming from within the classroom during this one period, but I can't prove that and I can't find the source of the interference. Kids are not permitted to use their phones though I'm sure many do have them on their person. Could a defective phone that isn't permitted to connect to the wireless DOS an enterprise-grade WAP?\n\nThe other thing that makes no sense is that if one of the kids had a problem device I would think it would impact other locations, seeing as how it's the same SSIDs all over. But we're only seeing it here. I'll admit the radio side of WiFi is not a strong point of mine so perhaps I'm missing something obvious.\n\nAny thoughts or suggestions are greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Verizon already has enterprise grade fiber at the site that was grandfathered in before the power company changed their attachment guidelines.  I know Comcast has off-net circuit delivery capabilities through other carriers, but I am wondering if anyone has ever had Comcast (or any other carrier for that matter) make use of Verizon's unused dark fiber strands for last mile circuit delivery.  I do not want to have verizon tunnel my traffic back to comcast, I'd prefer to just have comcast lease two of the remaining strands in the 24 strand fiber cable verizon already has feeding my building and just splice into that cable at a point about a quarter-mile from my building where both carriers have pole access.  Has anyone had this done successfully?  I know several people who have had success with asking smaller ISP's to use an alternative carrier (fibertech usually) for last mile, but fibertech would run into the same problem as comcast.

            "selftext": "Hey guys. I've read a few Cisco best practice guides, consulted with a company who originally sold us some equipment and did some configurations before I was hired, and also consulted with some providers who we're shopping around with.\n\nLong story short, I have two separate physical locations (about 40 miles apart) that share VLANs and, subsequently, broadcast domains. They're connected via a two strand dark fiber that terminates on either side into a Cisco 6506. We're seeing intermittent issues with this link, so we want a second link so that we can have redundancy and at least a path between the sites to keep things up if we want to do an OTDR or anything else on the dark fiber.\n\nWe're considering wave as it is quite a bit cheaper than dedicated dark fiber, but there are a lot of issues with this. First, a P2P over dark fiber works exactly how I need it to. Layer 1 transport via wave (which is essentially fiber multiplexing via WDM) is an unknown variable, and there is a bit that I don't understand regarding practical implementation.\n\nThe whole idea here was to create an EtherChannel and use LACP to connect my switches together using the existing dark fiber and whatever new circuit we implement. Speeds will match - both will be 10G. Handoff from the wave product is still single mode LC, so it will plug into my switch exactly the same way.\n\nIs this feasible? One consultant told me that he didn't recommend doing this. He recommended either getting another dark fiber, or nixing the dark fiber and doing two wavelengths. The problem evidently seems to be mixing the media, but I'm not quite sure why. He did mention sequencing issues with LACP, but didn't dive too far into it.\n\nThanks for any insight.",

Bearing in mind I am attempting the connection to SiteB and have a route in place for the 8 hosts i need access to, I believe???? everything should be fine.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe link isn't even getting established yet, which suggests some other kind of mismatch to me, before we even get to the encryption domain issues. I've never had such a hard to configure VPN in my life.\n\nAnyone out there willing to give me some pointers? Could the encryption domain \"mismatch\" be causing the link not to establish?\n\nThanks all\n\n[edit] Formatting's hard.\n",

            "selftext": "Looking for a sanity check on a dynamic routing design.  The scenario is:\n\n1) We have Active/Active firewalls along with Active/Active Load Balancers.\n2) The Load Balancers have their own security zone on the firewall as does our datacenter.\n3) Some of the applications in the data center, for some reason, have to talk to other applications that are load balanced.. therefore they have to be able to reach the VIPs on the load balancers instead of the app servers directly.\n4) Each security zone has it's own VRF on a downstream routing device which, along with OSPF, allows for load balancing to the firewalls and load balancers.\n\nWe wanted a design where adding a new VIP was as simple as possible so we went with dynamic routing and flagging each VIP to advertise.  The rest of the network is OSPF so we set it up that way on the load balancers as well.\n\nDue to the odd requirement of #3 above, we decided to create a link from the load balancers to the VRF associated with the data center networks.  The load balancers therefore advertise the VIPs both to the load balancer VRF and then to the associated security zone on the firewall (which is how clients access them) AND to the data center VRF so that the SNAT from the load balancing allows the servers a more direct route.\n\nThe trick is I don't want the VIPs to show up on the firewall through the datacenter VRF route, nor do I want the datacenter networks to show up on the firewall through the load balancer VRF.\n\n[Here is the design I'm currently using](https://i.imgur.com/tbHMMXU.png)\n\nThis design does seem to work although I still see routes for the datacenter networks on the load balancer VRF (Router 1).  All of the datacenter networks are actually configured on the datacenter VRF (Router 2) as belonging to Area 1.  The networks are directly connected there so Area 0 still seems to see them.  The load balancers (Router 3) have their own OSPF process and I've configured a default router to point them to the load balancer VRF (Router 1) and they receive the datacenter routes from the datacenter VRF (Router 2).\n\nI realize static routing may end up being a potentially better way to go for the load balanced VIPs but I wanted to see if anyone else had feedback or a better suggestion on this.\n\nAlso, I see that Cisco supports just doing IPv4 OSPF config in interfaces instead of doing the network statesments in the OSPF processes... are most people doing this now?\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n*Edit*  Forgot to include that the Load Balancers advertise the VIPs out as Ext-1 routes into OSPF which is why I went with NSSA on Area 2 to allow installation of those routes in the data center VRF but prevent them from going into Area 0 in that direction.",

Sadly when both (R1 or AP2) pass/transmit WLAN traffic for 2 clients at the same time the achieved bandwidth drops to 5-10MB/s. To be clear C1 is connected to R1 and C2 is connected to AP2. The clients are just doing an iperf3 file transfer among themselves.\n\nAs soon as I placed R1 on the floor and out of line of site of AP2 (some boxes of stuff attenuating) the achieved transfer is 55MB/s like one would hope.\n\nI don't have any reason to believe the vendor had a batch of units with bad band-pass filters causing spurious emissions outside of the spectral mask. When I check the FCC docs for the appliances, the FCC shows pass for \"frequency stability\" and \"spurious emissions\" at a 3M or 9' test distance which is akin to my setup.\n\nhttps://fccid.io/Q87-WRT1900AC/Test-Report/Test-Report-NII-pdf-2205639.pdf\n\nBecause of attenuation to necessary coverage areas I really do need to place these appliances on the same wall, near the ceiling, no more than 10-14' apart.\n\nIs there a wireless principle I'm unaware of that explains why R1 and AP2 are diminishing each other so greatly when transmitting at the same time, even though the channels are \"supposed\" to be completely isolated???\n\nIs placing a small strip of RF shielding fabric obstructing the line of site between the router and access point a feasible solution???\n\nI think a strip of RF shielding fabric between them may look tacky, but if that is the only solution, I'll gladly do it.
