Had the Saturday tunes playing, no user distractions, everything was good. I was just about to call it a day when I realized I still needed to update the subnet on our APC Smart-UPS RT 8000 XL. So serial cable in hand I worked my way around the back of the racks, took a seat, and plugged into the UPS...\n\nClick and Silence. \n\nFor the first time in two years, I learned very quickly what our server room sounds like when every piece of equipment is off. You could\u2019ve heard a pin drop if I wasn\u2019t dropping f bombs. If I hadn\u2019t been shitting my pants about what I\u2019d just done, it would have been nice just to take it in for a moment. But at that point I just prayed I hadn\u2019t caused some sort of permanent damage. Ran around to the front of the racks and powered the beast back on and everything (including our old SCO servers that I can\u2019t virtualize soon enough) came back on without a hitch. As you can imagine, those 20 seconds of silence were killed very quickly. \n\nTurns out, as some of you here likely already know, APC requires a proprietary serial cable. Found this link rather quickly after powering it back up: \nhttp://www.apc.com/us/en/faqs/FA156800/\n\nThey always say if you\u2019re not learning something new everyday what\u2019s the point, right?

            "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI could use some advice. I'm fresh out of college (this past December) with a degree in History/Social Studies Secondary Education. I've always been good with computers though, and have been doing computer work on the side for about 8 years now. I recently got a job as Desktop and Hardware Support for a moderately large ($30~ million) dental company. When I was hired, the position was essentially installing RAM upgrades, doing Windows Updates, etc. - very basic IT stuff, for $33k/year. Once my boss realized that I am able to do *far* more, I've been taking on way more responsibility.\n\nI'm now responsible for:\n\n* Building, ordering, inventory management, and accounting for every computer, scanner, printer, and tablet that we use.\n* Building, ordering, inventory management, and accounting for every computer that we sell to labs around the country - very high end systems ($2k/each, roughly)\n* Cybersecurity on our entire network including managing several APs, hardware firewalls, and servers.\n* Upkeep and maintenance of all of our data servers\n* SQL server management and report writing\n* AD administration for 17 locations across 6 states; 600-700 users at any moment, around 500 devices\n* WSUS administration\n* Licensing for all of our software and hardware - OSes, Office 365, Exchange\n* Exchange server management\n* Installation and repair for our $50,000 3D printers, CNC machines, and 3D scanners\n* All of our networking, both internal and external, everything from NIC cards to MPLS networking.\n\nOur IT department is small - we have the IT Manager who handles all the business decisions (making around $75k or so), the IT Analyst whose primary task is writing reports as needed (makes about same as me), and the IT Desktop/Hardware Support who does the computer repairs and upgrades. We were outsourcing our server upkeep and networking, but since I can do all of it (usually), we are cutting that contract in January to once a month instead of once a week. I had my 3 month review 2 weeks ago and received a $3,000/year raise (up to $36k now), but that felt like nothing. I realize, though, that the department head doesn't make much either, and that I also don't even have a degree in IT, but I have had every person in upper management in the company tell me that I'm the best thing that has happened to the company in 20 years. Once my boss retires, the current Analyst is going to take her job, and we are going to hire a part time college kid to do the low level IT stuff so I can focus on the higher-level work. It hasn't been made clear to me if that comes with a promotion though, or if my responsibilities will just shift.\n\nI look at job descriptions and read about what other people are doing, and I see so many people doing essentially just what I hired in for that are starting at $55k or more. Now I'm doing overseas training soon for $250,000 machines - I feel like I'm being robbed, but I just got a raise.. I don't know if it would be inappropriate to ask for an official promotion with a salary closer to what my responsibilities are when my boss retires. She has told me repeatedly that she sees me leaving the IT department within the year and moving over to our production (mills/printers/scanners) since I can make so much more money and be even more useful there, but again, no indication of an actual promotion or anything happening yet. I've only been there since June, so I don't want to stir up any trouble, but I want to be paid what I'm worth. Am I just stuck at the slow-raise for now?\n\nAny advice would be appreciated. I know I'm worth more than what I'm getting paid, I just don't know the course to go about it since my situation is pretty unusual.",

            "selftext": "A few friends and I are considering starting a small colocation space in Southeast Missouri. We're currently working out the details on the rent, cooling, power, and internet access. We have a preexisting relationship with our landlord from a seperate non-profit we run, so we think we'll have those parts to an acceptable spec. The space that we're looking at renting can fit 4 racks side by side, with plenty of room in front and back. There's also room for a desk or another group of two racks. We're not worried about equipment, we already have a lot of what's required or can aquire it for reasonable prices.\n\nThe biggest problem is that we don't have a lot of capital to sink into this; probably less than $5,000 and we don't really want loans. We know that it isn't a lot of money, but competing against the various cloud providers is difficult: our only legs to stand on are that it is local, on the second floor of an office building built like a brick shit house, and the area has 10 gig internet available (though we'd only worry about that until a customer requests it). It would also be a side job for all of us, so it doesn't have to support us, but it shouldn't sink us either.\n\nOur last major planning hurtle are the racks: the room isn't large enough for individual cages so we're looking for subdivided racks. They're a nice compromise that allows us to sell smaller slices of secured rack space. We don't mind this as we're not sure there's enough demand in the area to sell out entire racks, let alone large subdivisions of rack space.  \n\nWe like this [8](http://www.dsiwholesalers.com/item.cfm?id=198&itemname=DSI%208%20Compartment%20CoLocation%20Server%20Rack%20%2D%20DSI%201842) and this [6](http://www.dsiwholesalers.com/item.cfm?id=185&itemname=DSI%206%20Compartment%20CoLocation%20Server%20Rack%20%2D%20DSI%201642) section rack. The problem is the price, around $1500 each (plus shipping). We haven't seen many other options on the internet, maybe we're using the wrong search term (\"compartment server rack\"). We _could_ go with these, but we'd have to start with only 1 or 2 and get more after we've sold those out.\n\nDoes anyone know of any other options or happen to have any used racks they'd sell? Depending on where you're at, we might be able to work out the logistics of us transporting them.\n\nTL;DR: Looking for cheaper compartmentalized racks. We realize that you get what you pay for, but we don't have a high budget as it is.",

            "selftext": "After about 6 hours of trial and error, I finally revived this TeraStation. Senario was that it had no drives and I replaced them.\nUpon turning it on, it displayed \"TFTP Boot Recovery E06\". I spent most of the time searching. I do not understand why Buffalo does not make it easier to do or have a guide on their page. SO I decided to write down a culmination of what I gleaned from the Internet. Here is how I fixed it:\n\nYou will need these things:\n\n* Buffalo Terastation TS-XEL in EM Mode - reads TFTP Boot Recovery E06 on the LCD.\n* A computer. I used a laptop..having both wireless and wired connections was helpful. Dual wired would probably work too, or just one, but you need to change the IP, as I will explain.\n* The TFTP Boot Recovery program. Download here: https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B_oFnRRMAwk0SkYtdGpSdTNKTk0\n* The firmware updater for your model. Optain from Buffalo: http://www.buffalotech.com/products/category/network-attached-storage-nas\n   Easiest to click support and type model in.\n* Download NASNavigator from Buffalo as well.\n* Ethernet cord, any old patch cable will do.\n* Patience of a saint, a little luck and probably about a 1/2 hour to get it up and running now that I know what I am doing.\n\nPrep: Terastation turned off, with drives installed. Laptop turned on and connected to wireless. Ethernet cord connected to LAN1 on Terastation, the other end to LAN port of laptop.\n\nStep 1: Download TFTP Boot Recovery EXE for your appropiate model. Run the file. It is an self-extracting zip file.\n\nStep 2: Download latest firmware for your model. Extract it to a folder as well.\n\nStep 3: In the firmware updater folder, in my case it was called TS-X_FW1.71, you will see two particular files. Copy, do not move, initrd.img and uImage.img to another folder.\n\nStep 4: Rename initrd.img to initrd.zip and rename uImage.img to uImage.zip\n\nStep 5: Go to this page: http://buffalo.nas-central.org/wiki/Firmware_update and go to the bottom. There are four passwords in the section called Password Summary. You will need these to extract the files. Extract initrd.buffalo from the first file. I tried each of the passwords, in my case, the third one worked. In the second file, extract uimage-88f6281.buffalo\n\nStep 6: Place both files in TFTP Boot Recovery folder.\n\nStep 7: Configure LAN port of laptop to 192.168.11.1, subnet 255.255.255.0. The rest can be blank.\n\nStep 8: Launch TFTP Boot.exe\n\nStep 9: Turn on Terastation.\n\nStep 10: You will see on the command window of the TFTP Boot program that those two files were transferred.\n\nStep 11: Wait. It should say Welcome to Terastation after 30 seconds or so. Give it a minute, it seems to take a few moments to boot up. The power switch LED should stop blinking.\n\nStep 12: At this point, I had the NAS plugged into the network, and unplugged from the laptop. The NAS screen should say somthing like LINK SPEED 1000Mps after a few moments, followed by network address. Laptop was just using wireless, connected to same network. One guide said change the IP on the LAN again to match the NAS, but I felt this was easier, besides, it worked!\n\nStep 13: Launch TSUpdater.exe. The NAS should be discoverable at this point. Click update. You should get an error saying No Partition found. Close updater.\n\nStep 14: Edit TSUpdater.ini. Where it says NoFormatting = 1, change it to NoFormatting = 0\n\nStep 15: Launch TSUpdater. Click Update. Drives should be formatting now and firmware will be uploaded after formatting is done. This will take a few minutes. LCD finally changes to blue from red. Almost done!\n\nStep 16: Open NASNavigator. Should see the NAS there, at this point you can add a share, or launch the Web interface. I launched the web interface, and was greeted by it all in Japanese. Yay! Something else to fix! Its a bug apparently I found out.\n\nStep 17: Type in admin for username, and password for password. Go to the fourth tab, its right below the O in Buffalo. Expand the bottom window. You should see a field there that says \"Japanese\". Its the third down as of Firmware 1.71. Click the button on the bottom (I assumed it said Change), and you will see that the drop down is able to be changed. Oddly enough, the drop down is in Japanese followed by English. Change the language to English. Click the button on the left (again, I assumed it said Save). I needed to refresh the page, but everything is now in English.\n\nStep 18: Do a little dance and enjoy your renewed NAS.",

Backup is not in production.\n\n2. An untested backup is considered unreliable.\n\n3. Underprovision each drive. Is the drive 1TB? Create a partition using 950GB or so. Leave the rest unused and never use it. Modern drives will automatically use the unallocated space if needed to move sectors it detects as going bad. It will probably not report them as bad sectors.\n\n4. For each pair or group of drives, use two or more manufacturers. Reason: they will break down at very different intervals. For example, if you have a RAID 1 array with 1TB usable space, use two 1TB drives from different manufacturers, like HGST and Western Digital. This is ideal, but often not possible.\n\n5. Follow the 3-2-1 rule as the minimum. Have 3 copies of the data (not including the one in production). 2 of those copies are onsite and on different media (for example, disk and tape). One copy is offsite. This can be a different media type or the same. More copies are better. More media types are better. SSD and Winchester hdd are different media types (although few would be backing up to flash at this point). If you have a Windows server, there is an easy way to do this on the cheap. Get a USB hard drive and have Windows Backup backup to it nightly. Additionally, set up a backup to a cloud host. Cheap is not necessarily good, as we can see from this example. Since it is directly attached, the USB backup drive would be susceptible to any attack on the server itself. Ransomware might corrupt the data on the server and the data on the backup drive. A better setup would be a NAS that is the backup target (with the NAS running an OS different than Windows), and the NAS automatically backing up to a secure cloud host. You could also include a tape backup.\n",

Also, has anybody done a transition of IP scheme's before and can toss out some things to be aware of?\n\nThanks in advance for your help!",

But when I checked both SD cards, the installer said that there was still 5.5 on BOTH cards. Huh.  \nI went and upgraded the second SD card anyway to see what would happen - but again, the server boots into 5.5.\n\nI'm not very familiar with these dual SD card adapters - but it seems to me, that there is some kind of RAID1 or error correction thing going on, where the adapter reverted the changes on one SD card for $reasons by duplicating \"good\" data from the other one. Am I guessing right or is there something else going on?\n\nIt didn't seem as if the built-in ESXi recovery kicked in because of a bad install - the machine booted straight back into 5.5, without any alert or error message. \n\nI finally got it working by upgrading with the offline bundle ZIP instead of the ISO (which is way easier and faster), but I appreciate if anyone could shed some light on what could have happened here.  \n\n\n(upgrading via Update Manager wasn't an option because the highest working custom ISO is 6.0U3 from Lenovo but the VCSA is on 6.5...)",

There were no alarms, and my infrastructure monitoring software reported no issues.\n\nI'm planning to blow all this away soon since we're 90% migrated over to KVM. That said, I'd love to hear any thoughts on what may have occurred here, or if anyone else has ever experienced this. I'm still trying to get at the vCenter logs.",

            "selftext": "Case manager from a data recovery company here,\n\nThis past weekend we had one of the craziest cases I've ever seen. A company that had a 30 disk raid 6 set up in 16 and 14 sets with 5 of the drives down. 1 disk shot with platter damage, 2 badly degraded surface, and 2 lightly degraded surface, it went down Thursday night and Friday when they called us, they told us they were taking orders manually in their busy season, that's how bad. \n\nWe had 3 engineers around the clock, all weekend long. The issue we were running into when trying to reconstruct the raid was the drives had high amount of bad sectors. Then finally when we thought we could reconstruct raid with 1 downed drive still, we realized this was an old system that had proprietary code contained in the hardware, so without the cages we couldn't reconstruct. That's when one of the engineers had the crazy idea of trying to do exact clones of the bad drives, correct as much bad sectors as possible and hope it'll just boot up. We rewrote the new cloned drives serial numbers to the old drives' serial numbers so the raid would think it's rebooting original drives. Sunday mid day we had a courier get the drives back out to them same day (across the country).  We stepped their System admin on how to put the drives back and safety boot up. They were up and running monday morning. He said their daily losses would have been in the millions. \n\nMoral of the story: MAKE SURE YOU BACK UP OLD SYSTEMS WELL\n\nIf anyone here ever has a data recovery question, please feel free to ask me. Pm's welcome. \n",

Is there an easier process of performing the same tasks (can I demote DC1 after transferring FSMO and go straight into spinning up a new 2016 DC1)?

I work overnights at Amazon so I can work opposite shifts of my wife to lessen the burden of childcare.

Henry Schein is the company that produces the software along with selling/distributing countless other dental products and services. Among those services is a data backup solution that can be used for Dentrix data called eBackup.\n\nMy client uses eBackup and had an issue where the program settings reset and the software was no longer performing backups. With the help of support I found out this was due to a low space condition that I had already resolved, however the failure was permanent for some reason and the program would need to be reconfigured.\n\nI was not involved in the original setup of the program and did not have the password needed to connect the backup software to our eBackup account. I asked the support person if we could reset the password and they said I would need to check the associated email account for a link to reset the password.\n\nWhen I received the email and followed the link I was prompted to enter our customer ID number and practice zip code. On the next page I was shown what was obviously the existing password!\n\nAfter voicing my concerns, I asked about how the data being sent is encrypted. I was told it's encrypted before being transmitted but that it's encrypted using the same password as the login for the eBackup service!\n\nI'm just small time compared to others in this sub so I imagine the issues here are obvious. I can't imagine anything they could be doing to make eBackup secure if the information I have about it is accurate.\n\nThe support person suggested I submit my concerns and this information in an email to Henry Schein but I first wanted your opinion and any suggestions on how to approach this. Also, It's clear this is against HIPAA best practices but is there any possibility it's an actual violation?\n\n**tl;dr:** Backup service for sensitive patient data doesn't hash passwords and uses the same password to encrypt the actual data, wtf?",

However, this did not work for me. I have roughly ~300 MB worth of data in there, so naturally I'd expect it to take a while to redirect that folder back to my local hard drive, but it simply wasn't. %appdata% kept redirecting me back to the storage server.\n\nAm I doing something incorrectly?

            "selftext": "Hello fello admin friends. Something's been on my mind lately, a lot more than any time in the past.\n\nThings. Are. Changing. Fast.\n\nI'm 36 years old and started my Sysadmin days as an Intern of Systems Administration at 19 years old. I've been doing this in some capacity or another for the past 17 years. Lately, I've really been seeing some major changes in the marketplace and have been pondering on how to stay relevant.\n\nThrough my tenure, being a SysAdmin was pretty standard. Patching, building hardware, deploying servers, managing networks, group policy, AD, Exchange etc.\n\nThen things like VMWare came around and changed the game a bit...but not terribly so. Everything was on prem and my role felt secure.\n\nThe past year or so, I've been seeing the writing on the wall. The general Windows Admin role is heading for some major changes. Between Azure, AWS, containerization, O365 (and all other cloud platforms), hyper converged systems, things are changing in a way that I don't remember seeing in my past.\n\nI just wanted to see if this was something I was \"feeling\" vs. it actually being a reality. It seems like, more than ever, you need to take a look at what you're doing and start honing your skills. Whether that is getting new certifications in Azure/AWS, looking at cutting down your on-site data infrastructure and removing SANs and most server hardware and replace it with things like Simplivity to cut costs and provide performance or migrating to O365 for small/mid sized businesses or even containerization for companies that do a lot of development.\n\nFor the first time in my life, I am starting to feel like the low-level admin roles are in for a real surprise. You used to be able to sneak in with a base knowledge of Windows and hardware and make a good salary. I am feeling like more and more those days are gone. No more building a local datacenter on traditional hardware and just going status quo, you need to adapt, educate and prove you're worth your mettle.\n\nI'm just curious what other's have out there for an opinion. Is the industry changing in a major way that we've never seen before?",

            "selftext": "how do you do, fellow sysadmins?\n\nI need to blow off some steam with the false feeling that some of you will find this interesting on some level and the mods would not remove it for cursing. The truth is that I'm tired, pissed, and english is not my first language so it could be a mess. Well, better than yesterday's mess, anyway.  \n\nSome backstory: I work in a (small) IT team that manage some (medium-small) datacenters. The main one has a vmware cluster, a hpc cluster, a lot of NAS a shitton of other legacy solutions (vintage kvm hosts and guets, old server that no one want to touch, the usual stuff).   \n\nWe share the server room with another IT department that had to install a behemoth rack that (of course) needed a new power line. The electricians on monday asked a complete shutdown of the room (so, including our servers) for this friday.  \n\nI won't go into details but we have a ton of stuff that is expected to run 24/7 so I pushed (a lot) for thursday (as in: yesterday, next week was not an option) to have another working day to fix stuff in case of troubles, and while my (new) boss gave all this a total amount of zero f*cks I had to plan the shutdown, coordinate with all the people hosting services in our datacenter, send e-mail to users et cetera.  \n\nMy biggest mistake: I had to migrate some services on another datacenter, I was planning to do it in a couple of weeks, I decided to do it at the same time as the shutdown to minimize downtime. Well, that didn't worked out so well.  \n\nOf course, the db (oracle) sysadmin was on vacation. Of course, the HPC cluster sysadmin was on vacation. Of course, rescheduling was not an option. So I ended up with a list of instructions to follow to shut down the oracle servers, another list of instructions to shut down the HPC cluster, my fuckload of servers to shut down and the service migration. What could go wrong?  \n\nYesterday (The Longest Day\u2122) my boss peeked out my office door while I was in a kind of pre-shutdown meeting with colleagues of other departements, smiled and said \"ha! all this confusion for a shutdown, it's easy, we could just flip the switch\" and away he went laughing.  \nMy colleagues gave me the \"is he retarded?\" look and I tried to gave them the \"hey, at least it's not your boss\" look in return.\nFast forward to the actual shutdown: things started to go south, in a subtle way: vmware hosts not entering maintenance mode, I couldn't find a devel that was supposed to help me during the shutdown, the whole thing was delayed by 40 minutes. In the meantime I had a procession of users that didn't read the two mail I sent about the shutdown asking \"why nothing is working?\". I briefly considered hitting them with a couple of old hard disks I keep on my desk.  \n\nI manage to shut down everything, the electricians pulled the plug, they were actually quite fast, and this is the list of things that went wrong:\n\n* one of the main storage controllers wouldn't start, we used a ungodly amount of raw devices that changed path and weren't recognized anymore by vmware hosts\n* one of the NAS wouldn't start\n* I couldn't restart the HPC cluster\n* the service migration I planned failed (very badly) for a number of misunderstanding between me and a devel (technically, it was contributory negligence)\n* a provider that has a rack in our server room failed to start his servers via ipmi so asked us to power them up in a certain order\n\nSo, at 15pm a team of two (me and the other devel, my boss left during the outage without even telling me) had to parallelize all this.  \n\nAfter a 14 hours shift we gave up, I prepared a (calm, cold and technical) mail with a list of things that still weren't expected to work in the morning and sent it to all the (internal) colleagues involved, including my boss and a couple of other managers.  \n\nThe next day (today) I went to work depressed and nauseous but somehow ready to keep on fixing things. At 11am my boss called me (he works in a nearby town most of the days). I don't like him but I could have used a pat on the back. But no. He was annoyed because last night I shouldn't have sent the email without calling him first, because I was \"spreading panic\" and he has \"more experience in communicating things\". Basically his primary concern was that the other managers could took him for the schmuck he is (spoiler alert: they do)  \n\nWell, this kind of broke me. I never really worked for him, to me it's always been more about the collegues who use our services, they're the one that I'm leaving in the shit if I don't work well. But now I feel completely unmotivated.  \n\nWell, that's it. Sorry about the long post, but even writing this down has already helped me a bit.\n\nEdit: thanks *a lot* for all the heart-warming comments so far (and for the two golds! [woah](http://www.picgifs.com/reaction-gifs/reaction-gifs/it-crowd/picgifs-it-crowd-3381082.gif) ) it will take me some time to respond to the commens (but I will). Thanks again.",

And I originally posted this in r/TIFU but my post was removed because apparently the mod thinks that my entire organizations services/infrasturcture being down for 2+ hours and subsequently causing me to pull my hair out to try and fix it isn't something bad happening to me..... so anyway I can atleast give you guys a laugh over here in /sysadmin\n\nI come into the office like any other Friday, I check monitoring to make sure all my hosts/vms are running and everything's fine.\n\nI go to start a new project in which I am moving the on-premises FileMaker Pro Server running on a little Mac mini in my office to a VM on my esxi host, part of this involved running a shell script on the host. So I run the patch, reboot the machine, host comes back up no problem, a little time goes by in which I have a meeting during, come back to my office and shit hits the fan, none of the vms auto started, my entire infrastructure was down for over and I didn't even realize it due to the meeting.\n\nSo fast forward I'm scrambling to get to the data center to gain physics access to the host to reinstall esxi and re-register the vms back up asap mean while my main clients phones, website, crm, project manager, and all other internal applications and intranet as well as the main domain controller we're all down! Thankfully I have a slave on premesis and the on site phones have a copper backup/fail over so all was not lost. \n\nI finally make it to the data center after almost 2 hours of downtime, reinstall the OS, register all the VM's, check to make sure all my services where back up and then off to lunch to try and forget about the shit show of a Friday I had stumbled myself into today..... lesson learned either run HA with a cluster for live migration for no downtime or atleast do sketchy updates, patches, anything else that could cause unplanned downtime during businesss hours to a more isolated time like the middle of the night when no ones accessing services..\n\n\nTLDR; I installed a patch, borked my virtualization platform and brought most of my companies services down for 2+ hours today. Way to start my weekend!  \n\nEdit: just for some clarification here we are not a large company, only have 2 locations and one server in a DC, so those affected by this fuck up wasn't too bad and thankfully we still have some back up services for redundancy however certain services that were down today have no redundancy setup yet.

            "selftext": "Hi,\n\nI've been doing IT for free for the past 10-15 years for a charity not far from where I live. This summer, they got a new director ( I got along very well with the old director ).\n\nSo here are some incidents that have happened since the new director started\n\n1. The new director asked me to setup a phone and his computer in his new office ( I used a red cable because it's the only one I had available on short notice, and a yellow one from the phone to his laptop ). He doesn't like the colors of the cables, so he wants me to change them for white cables. AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. Like it seems to be a national emergency that the cables are the wrong color...  In the past, aesthetic jobs have always been low priority and anything that actually affects the user experience ( broken computer, slow computer, etc... ) has been high priority.\n\n2. I stopped by for a configuration issue on a computer, and he stopped me in the hall and said 'when are you going to get my printer installed?' I said 'what printer?'. Turns out he bought a printer and didn't bother to tell me. Somehow he was magically expecting me to guess he had a printer that needed installing, seriously...\n\n3. I had to run a wire for him between two offices. Because of health issues, it took more time than normal ( it was delayed two weeks ). And because of health issues and other obligations, I have not finished the job ( the cable is connected directly with RJ-45 cables instead of installing a wall plug and the plastic covers to hide the wire are not installed yet, so the cable is hanging freely in the corner of both offices ). He is putting a LOT of pressure on me to fix this as soon as possible. For me it's a low priority issue at this point because it's only aesthetics that are left, but for him it's really important.\n\n4. Any time he texts me issues, he is very unclear about the issue. One issue he texted me about I went and it wasn't happening and I suspect it was to trick me into coming in for a lower priority issue.\n\n5. He has used empty threats to pressure me. He called me once and said 'I need the password for X equipment' and I said 'why?', he said 'I have another guy who will install Y and he needs the info'. I said 'great, have him call me, I'll give him any information he needs. I don't want to play broken-telephone and have to repeat the information multiple times'. He said I was being difficult and I reiterated that giving IT info to a non IT guy to give to another IT guy will waste everyone's time and to have him contact me directly'. I waited and the \"other IT guy\" never contacted me, so finally I called the director back and said that I would be heading out to do the job because the guy never called me. the director said \"oh, I'll tell the other guy to forget about it\". This sounds suspiciously like manipulation.\n\nNow I am told that the head office wants to \"Upgrade\" the time clocks to a new web based time clock system. I know it was chosen because it was the cheapest option available. The clock system uses 'IP authentification', so I have to provide the IP of the internet connection. Of course the office uses a dynamic IP because it's an office, not a data centre... Anyways, I wrote back and they suggested I send all the subnets used by the ISP, they also suggested an overly complicated 'token based authentification' system that could be used to identify the computers. But this will mean I will have to do their process for each user account and will have to redo it any time someone does the 'clear navigator cache' or I delete someone's profile because it's too big. It looks like one of those projects where they are trying to save a few dollars, but instead lose 10 times as much with all the extra support that IT will have to do.\n\nAt this point, I think I will simply quit and tell them to find someone else. If they want to waste their money on a 'web based punch clock system' that will cost 100 times more than a proper hardware solution, I don't want to be the one to have to support all the fallout of that decision.\n\nThat being said, I am looking for advice. Should I quit? Should I give them a copy of this rant? What should I do?\n\nThanks!\n\n\n",

            "selftext": "A tale of woes and sorrow--- Anybody else got some good ones? \n\nWorking for a local MSP-- we have most of our clients on Reflexion, which I consider a fairly decent product and service.\n\nLo and behold we have a single client(one of our largest) on AppRiver that was not previously migrated, because hey, they weren't having issues, they seemed generally happy as well, so why switch?\n\nWell yesterday we get a call, no inbound mail, for any user. When sending mail to them, there is no bounceback/NDR. After initial investigation(DNS, Mail Route, Domain exp, etc), I determine it's most likely an issue on AppRiver's side(likely being blocked). After a 30 minute conversation, their technician determined that \"somehow\" for some reason, the connection to the email provider(Google) is saying that it's \"broken\". He also makes mention that they have over 100 emails in their queue trying to deliver.\n\nThe technician then checked for other Google clients and confirmed their mail was being routed correctly. At this point, he determined it must be an issue on Google's end, and to call Google. Now, I know that issues with Google can happen, but come on, please don't point the finger at Google for rejecting mail from YOUR server. I ask them if they can reach out instead, as I am not sure of what message they are exactly getting so I'm not sure what to tell Google. They say no, it's not their responsibility.\n\nCall Google, go through the diagnosis dealio, they are almost positive it's an issue on AppRiver's end, but cannot confirm. They need error messages or logs indicating failure(surprise).\n\nCall AppRiver back, talk to another technician, I make mention of whole situation and that it's a critical issue because there is no incoming mail, for at least the last 2 hours at this point. I also make mention that the previous person told me there is over 100+ mail messages in their queue. This new technician says the queue is empty. I check mailboxes and confirm that no mail has been sent, so either their queue dropped all messages or he is totally incorrect. Then he tells me he can see mail relaying successfully. Still incorrect.\n\nI conference Google in with AppRiver technician. At the end of the conversation, the AppRiver technician suggests that he do a mail trace on his end -- and asks for a sample message. I give him a sample. He tells me it will take a few minutes and asks if he can call me back or email the results. I say sure. I again emphasize the importance of this issue.\n\n30 minutes later, I ask for a status update.\n\nAnother 30 minutes later, I ask for another status update. At this point, mail begins to flow. Nine minutes later, I receive a response about the issue. Surprise, it was an issue on their end.\n\nThe entirety of the issue took about 3 hours to resolve. Then later throughout the day, the client was getting delayed mail(sometimes 15 minutes, sometimes hours).\n\nNeedless to say, now they're on Reflexion. AppRiver lost a client and any future clients. I've known their service to be pretty old/antiquated for SPAM Filtering, but I didn't know their support was too. ",

All users are in Office OU that has child Department OU's. Often visits from nearby office users or other colleagues from different countries. Currently only couple of these printers are mapped automatically and majority of work is done manually (dont beat us up on this - we've inherited this after a local guy that was pretty lost :) ).\n\nWe've came to conclusion that using GPP on User settings are the best way to do this, but we are considering filtering/scoping options:\n1. Link 1 central printer policy to a whole Office OU (or higher), filter it to authenticated users and set up item level targetting on each printer based on OU\n2. Link 1 central printer policy to a whole office OU (or higher), filter it to authenticated users and set up item level targgeting on each printer based on new security groups\n3. Separate each printer to its own GPO and have it linked to departments OU with authenticated users filtering\n4. Separate each printer to its own GPO and have it linked to Office OU and filter using security groups\n\nI tend to say that option 2 is best for our needs as we will simply have groups and add users to them (and this can be done for anyone including visitors, people from the other office etc.).\n\nAny feedback much appreciated!\n\nLastly, please excuse possible grammar mistakes - I am not native speaker :)\n\nThanks!",

I jump in, say No No No... I look up the domain, it's google apps, registered through google as well.  Ok, should be an easy shutdown.  I forwared an .eml attachment to the google abuse address....\n\nThey can't open EML files.  They want a .jpg image of the scam email.  What the F'ing hell? What can you tell from a JPG?  I might as well photoshop some bogus damn image and say microsoft.com is scamming me.\n\nWow... Amazing.

            "selftext": "Hi guys\n\nI use Keepass2 for my personal passwords, and I backup the file regularly.\n\nHowever, for our business of 5 people, we're looking for a strong solution that makes life easier for everyone. At the moment we don't have any password management system.\n\nLastPass looked like it was everything we needed. It doesn't look like it has been compromised, has great features, permission systems and works on every device.\n\nHOWEVER- when installing LastPass on my computer it asked me if I wanted to move my passwords stored in my Chrome Smart Lock password manager into LastPass, and then delete the contents of the Chrome Smart Lock. I can see why - during the installation of LastPass it was able to show in plain text all of my Chrome Smart Lock passwords for everything. I have now learned just how easy it is for this information to be accessed by anyone who has brief access to my system.\n\nMy concern is this... given how easy it is to view passwords stored in Chrome Smart Lock / passwords.google.com (and I assume other browser password managers), if one of our employees saves their LastPass login credentials in one of these password managers, wouldn't an intruder then have easy access to all the LastPass stored passwords to our business assets and client assets?\n\nThis seems like an enormous risk. At the moment our business and client credentials are stored all over the place -\n which is incredibly disorganised but also decentralised, which has its benefits. To save them all in one central location and share them with our whole team is risky enough. But then having that all hinge on the fact that I have to trust our employees never to save their LastPass login details to their browser... even accidentally without thinking... that's a big ask. All it would take is one employee to leave their computer open unattended for someone to see their LastPass password in plain text at passwords.google.com or chrome://settings/passwords, login, and then download all of our business/client credentials.\n\nIs there a way to prevent this from occurring? I can't be the only one who has this hesitation.",

In some cases, it seems to be due to the site being compromised.  Last week we noticed Coinhive JS had been injected into a Prettify JS file, on [a Shoppers Drugmart website](https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/73bqck/psa_shoppers_drug_mart_jobs_site_hosting_bitcoin/), fairly hidden.  CBS's Showtime site was even[ hosting Coinhive recently](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/09/25/showtime_hit_with_coinmining_script/)\n\nIn other cases, such as The Pirate Bay, and [this site](http://cavemancafe.ca/) which popped up in our logs today, it seems to be a choice made by the site owner.\n\nuBlock Origin seems to block Coinhive and others by default, and ESET is blocking whatever makes it past uBlock.  So far nothing seems to have actually succeeded in passing both.\n\nI've seen some other projects, like [CryptoCoinJS](http://cryptocoinjs.com/), but Coinhive seems to be the only one I've actually seen in operation.\n\nThat all said, it seems like this is a rising trend, and one that will likely need to be monitored as time goes on.  \n\nI don't see a problem with a company leveraging this as a way of supplementing their income, so long as they are upfront about it.\n\nAs an admin, however, I do have concerns about it impacting my users.\n\nWhat have you all noticed?  Do any of you have any stories/plans you can share?  Have you seen any other miners out there besides Coinhive and CryptoCoinJS?\n\nEdit: words",

Basically, I am taking an online course that I have to connect to Adobe connect once a week.  I do not physically have to log in but rather I am under a guest account. At first, I was able to get it to work, but now it is getting stuck on the loading screen every time. What was so strange was I was able to get it to work between two separate times I couldn't get it to work. Basically, I think it has something to do with adobe connect add-in, and it either not loading right or an issue with that. Previously I have gotten some form of pop up saying adobe connect add-in and now nothing pops up. I have redownloaded adobe connect add-in as well as everything else to make sure everything is up to date. I am just so confused and have no idea on how to fix such an issue. Sorry for rambling hopefully someone might be able to help me.",

Looking for good resources/forums for education/support. They can be free or subscription based.\n\nFor some background, I am a hobbyist programmer who works for a field service company as a coordinator. When I started here earlier this year, the systems were really out of date and tedious, so I wrote some software to interface with our accounting system and field reports, and set up a database to replace the 1000's of PDFs that were floating around on dozens of laptops and email inboxes.\n\nMy company is now looking to ditch our IT consultant and move me into an IT position. I would be responsible for planning a server upgrade, backup solution + business continuity plan, exchange server, setting up a server room, setting up subscriptions and software on all of our management and technician laptops, and setting up a VOIP phone system for our various offices.\n\nAs mostly a software guy, this will be a bit of a daunting task and there will be a lot to learn, which is why I am looking for more resources to help me make these decisions. Luckily I have access to the current IT consultant before the switch happens so I can learn a lot from him, but I'm open to any suggestions for resources you might have.\n\nFor an idea of the scope of what I am working with:\n\n-15-20 technicians on the road\n\n-<25 users across 5 offices\n\n-Server hosted in head office or in offsite data centre - not decided yet\n\n\nThanks in advance for any tips/resources!\n\nEDIT: Just read this in the FAQ: \"Exchange\n\nDon't do it. Honestly, just don't. It's not worth it, get O365 and use that. No Exchange, no GApps, just stick to O365.\"\n\nAny more details on this would be great! We were already planning on getting everyone on O365, so this is probably the route we will take.",

            "selftext": "I had a few users in the last week complain that their outlook keeps asking for credentials, mostly when opening attachments or using the attachment preview. Any password given to this password prompt will not work and it will keep coming back. So today I dug into the depths of Outlook 2016 to figure out what the problem was.\n\nThe problem started after opening attachments and it was asking for a password. No password will work to get this prompt to go away. So I did the sensible thing and cleared all of the cached outlook credentials in the Windows Credential Manager. No Dice. I noticed that after putting in a password to this prompt it created an entry in the Credential Manager where it was for outlook.office.com. Weird. Deleted that and tried again same thing. So I opened up ProcMon to take a look at where it was trying to get these credentials, traced it down to a server from microsoft that does indeed point to outlook.office.com. We dont use any services with that address. ProcMon also told me it was going over 443 so I opened up Fiddler 4 and took a look at the request. It was sending telemetry information (users email address included) to outlook.office.com and the result of that was a 401 unauthorized error. Unauthorized means password prompt. We have found the problem. Unfortunately the only solution I could come up with and was appropriate because our client does not use services associated with outlook.office.com was to add that entry in to our DNS server and point it to the loopback address 127.0.0.1. This eliminated the password prompts.\n\nTLDR: Repeated password prompts, entry in credential manager for outlook.office.com despite not using those services. Telemetry is returning 401. Blocked DNS requests to that address to prevent the 401.\n\nHope this helps some frustrated sysadmins out there.",

Usually these don't overlap.  Usually.\n\nA single Windows 10 machine needs access to resources on both, using domain authentication, without being joined to either.  Yes, it's stupid, but it needs to be done.\n\n**Issues** : \nThe Simple workaround to allow NT4 domain authentication with the \"LAN Manager\" setting \"Send LM&NTLM\" allows access to the NT4 resources, but blocks all access to the 2012 domain. \n\nSetting it to \"NTLMv2 only\" or any other setting allows access to the 2012 domain resources, but blocks the NT4 domain access.\n\nChanging the auth level on the 2012 servers directly doesn't appear to have any effect at all.  Doing some reading it seems that \"NTLM Negotiation\" is a bit of a misnomer, and it never actually *negotiates* the auth level between client and server.\n\nAlso -  Kerberos isn't working properly because they refuse to properly implement DNS, and all mappings are done by IP anyway.  Some of this is hardcoded into custom programs, scripts, and macros done years ago that it isn't feasible to update immediately.\n\nSlightly up the creek on this one, anyone have a magic workaround, I would really appreciate the help.\n\n***FRIDAY UPDATE***: Talked the vendor who controls the main 2012 domain to set it to allow NTLMv1 until the NT4 domain is decommissioned.  Just had to find the right person to talk to, not the half-technical guys who also do general customer service.  Thanks everyone for the ideas, this really does seem like an unwinnable situation.\n\nIn case any time-travellers find this in a search, here's some good resources I found in my travels :\n\n* https://itconnect.uw.edu/wares/msinf/other-help/lmcompatibilitylevel/ntlmv1-removal-known-problems-and-workarounds/\n* http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/2006.08.securitywatch.aspx\n* https://support.microsoft.com/en-ca/help/2701704/audit-event-shows-authentication-package-as-ntlmv1-instead-of-ntlmv2\n* https://richardkok.wordpress.com/2011/02/03/wireshark-determining-a-smb-and-ntlm-version-in-a-windows-environment/\n",

Everything was fine until today when it started asking that disk encryption is missing and it would not allow the connection to be established.\n\nI have SEP anti-virus installed. So, blindly I choose Symantec Desktop Encryption software to encrypt my laptop disk which has windows OS. Little did I know that it would stop me from booting my laptop.\n\nThanks to reddit, now I have started the decryption process. Hopefully it succeeds. \n\nAssuming that it succeeds, I am still in need of an encryption software for my full disk encryption. I have windows 10 home installed which doesn't have bit locker. So, I did some googling and found that \"VeraCrypt\" is a good open-source choice. \nWill you suggest me to use it as the only requirement I am searching for is to be able to connect to my work from home.\n\nThanks in advance. \n\nEdit 1: Thanks for the responses. I have not thought that I am doing something wrong without contacting our IT department. Now that you have enlightened me, I'll get it touch with them (Hopefully they give me a solution) \n\nEdit 2: Windows 10 pro + Bit locker did the trick. Thanks again. \n",

I have the same question via Citrix as well but I'm assuming using native Windows Services maybe simpler vs adding the complexity of Citrix environment but I'll listen to either one.\n\n\nthanks,\nClay",

Get ready to laugh... we have Novell, we use an app called Identity Manager to copy EDirectory over to Active Directory. Then using Azure AD Connect synchronizes with Exchange Online.\n\nOne of my biggest questions is ... when I was taught how to add users here for an email address, it was, add to Novell, assign an exchange online license, go to Exchange Admin Center and add as a MAIL USER under contacts.\n\nShould I be adding it as a MAILBOX instead? I get the feeling that's where it should be. As it has more features and controls. But then comes the question of the MAILBOX DATABASE. What is this? Is this a copy of the user's mailboxes stored on the local server (on site) one? I wouldn't want to take up a bunch of storage space on that if we're paying for the online accounts to have in the cloud.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/NUfCf\nhttps://imgur.com/a/V3Nko\n\nLastly, a couple of users were deleted and should not have been (not by me) but they need to be restored.

I hear from Mac it's passable but it's really only decent from Windows to Windows with the LMI client.\n\nThe \"obvious\" choice was RDP, but it doesn't seem to allow remote control and shadowing like LMI - even when you give the -0 flag to rdesktop, it locks the remote computers screen. Before I spend a LOT on ScreenConnect / Connectwise Control or RealVNC (the only 2 I've found that both have good Linux to Windows control performance, might be within budget, and support AD auth and on-premises systems) - has my google fu failed me? \n\nIs there yet another flag for rdesktop or RDP in general that would allow it to work like LMI or the other programs and not lock out the remote computer when someone remote controls it, but still see the same screen as if someone sat down in front of the PC?",

            "selftext": "I'm an operations engineer at an MSP and have been asked to go to the data centers to inventory all of the hardware that's in our cages, our customer's cages that we have access to, and any other equipment or packages we might have in the docks or holding areas. We maintain a couple of our DCs, and have space at another company's DCs. The issue is no one person or department manages the purchasing of equipment or the tracking and receiving of said equipment. No one knows when things get delivered, where they get delivered too (almost always to the wrong floor or cage), or what the equipment sitting in these places go to. Just looking at 2 of the 6 or so DCs in our area, I'm estimating that there's over 1 million dollars in hardware that's sitting. Some of it is RMA replacements, some of it is for upcoming projects (and no one working the project knows it was ordered or delivered), some of it is for cancelled projects, some of it is decom (no procedure for actually removing old gear from the cages or DC), and some of it we just don't know.\n\nManagement doesn't understand how bad this really is, and the engineers either don't speak up about it enough, or management doesn't listen. There needs to be proper procedures for ordering, tracking, and having the DCs place equipment to only one spot for our company and our customers, so that we know it can only be in one spot. The shipping/receiving at the DCs need to be on board and follow the process (which the DC nazi at one DC we don't own won't follow), as well as all of the engineers and management that oversee employees who access the DCs. Did I mention that with all of this lack of asset tracking, one could just walk out of the DC with hardware, and no on would know it was gone, because no one knew it was there in the first place?!\n\nI'm debating on how I should handle this. The task of managing it all full time is not what I want to do, as I want to move up to higher levels of engineering. I expressed from the start of the task, that I'll get a base inventory of everything, and management will have to work on a solution to manage it all. However, I don't even want to waste my time doing that, as tomorrow the inventory at a location can be completely different. Things can get delivered or moved to other cages, racked, moved to another DC altogether, or stolen... because that could very well happen.\n\nWith the amount of expensive gear we have there, selling old equipment, or equipment for cancelled projects could fund a salary employee to maintain the entire process, yet I doubt management would go for that... What do you do? What would you do? What's the best way to handle this, other than telling management that they done F'd up and they should fix their mess on their own?",

As the title states I am looking for some advice regarding internships for this upcoming summer. I have recently been extended an offer to work as an intern for a large defense contractor during the school year, and through the summer of 2018. This company is a huge player in the cyber field, it would be great to have my foot in the door here, and they might even let me acquire a US security clearance. However, my duties will mostly be basic data entry and assistance in various tasks throughout their operations, things that are not super relevant to things like IT infrastructure and cyber security, fields I would like to get into once I've graduated from school.\n\n\nMy question for you all is this: Do you think that waiting on this offer to find something more relevant to IT would be a good idea? As I said, it would be great to get my foot in the door at a big defense contractor like this, but at the same time I think it would be advantageous to keep my options open. I'd rather have an internship actually related to IT rather than just basic data entry and things like that, but of course there's no guarantee that I will receive an offer from somewhere else. It's definitely a tough decision.\n\nAlso, as a note: Pay and things like that aren't super relevant to me at this point. The pay is competitive with other companies and housing/travel is something I will not have to worry about. I'm mostly concerned about the impact that accepting a job like this may have on my resume, and what opportunities I may be passing up by accepting an offer so early on.\nLet me know what you guys think would be best, thank you for your responses!",

I am trying to create an AD trust between 2 domains.\n\nDomain 1:\n\n* CORP\n* Windows Server 2008\n* Has a conditional forwarder pointing to CORP-US.COM\n\nDomain 2:\n\n* CORP-US.COM\n* Windows Server 2016\n* Has a conditional forwarder pointing to CORP\n\nI'm able to create the first half of the trust - on domain 1, I can create the trust from CORP -> CORP-US.COM. \n\nHowever, when I try to create the 2nd half - CORP-US.COM -> CORP - I am not able to get this to work. When I walk through the New Trust Wizard, I end up getting a message saying \"The name you specified is not a valid Windows domain name\". It then gives me an option to set up a \"Realm trust\" or try again to do a \"Windows Domain Trust\". When I choose Windows Domain Trust (as this is what I want), it fails.\n\nI have tried many different things today, including changing the registry settings on all of the CORP-US.COM DCs and clients based on [this recommendation](http://windowsitpro.com/networking/single-label-domain-dns-resolution).\n\nI'm sure this has to do with DNS and the single-label domain, I just am not sure how to resolve it and am looking for any suggestions. Does this have to do with the differences in OS versions/domain functional levels? Is there some easy DNS fix I am missing?\n\nI should add that I am able to resolve DNS across both domains to the other domain (e.g. nslookup for host1.CORP works on a CORP-US.COM machine, and nslookup for host1.CORP-US.COM works on a CORP machine.)\n\nAppreciate any insights.

We are constantly getting endpoint agent installs that have services that refuse to start, and won't talk back to Central properly so we cannot disable tamper protection. Even trying to disable it locally just doesn't work as the settings just get ignored and revert. So performing a reinstall of the agent is near on impossible, even when booting into safe mode like their KB articles recommend. \n\nIt shouldn't get to the point where it is easier to re-image a whole PC then it is to repair an AV client.

To be honest, I really don't have much experience with the vxrail, and extremeIO so any input would be great.   \n\nAnother reason i like the vsan solution is that to add 100-125 more desktops i know i need one server and vmware licensing and im good to go.\n\nEDIT:  also from a vSAN configuration and connectivity we will be connecting all hosts via 10GB, to two 10GB switches and will connect those 10GB Switches to our Core Switches.

Organizations are eliminating unnecessary CapEx and OpEx by accelerating the time to provision networking and security services, and reducing the cost for compliance and audits, saving them up to 25% of their IT budgets.  \n\nThis means nothing to me. This device probably costs one zillion dollars, plus licensing fees and a support contract.

Basically, most packages use a  `.bat` file to accomplish multi-step installs with the free version of PDQ. You can edit the batch files to see what they do; most just delete \"All Users\" desktop shortcuts and things like that. `changelog-v##-updated-<date>.txt` has version and release history in addition to random notes where I complain about things like Reader DC and how much of a pain it is to build packages for. But actually though and for real it is a hideous pain to build for. Please someone for the love of G-d...accost Adobe and tell them to fix their a+ garbage customization routine. \n\n2. Thunderbird:\n - Thunderbird is configured to use a global config file stored on a network share. This allows for settings changes en masse. By default it's set to check for config updates every 120 minutes.\n - You can change the config location, update frequency, OR disable this behavior entirely by editing `thunderbird-custom-settings.js`.\n - A copy of the config file is in the Thunderbird directory and is called `thunderbird-global-settings.js`\n - If you don't want any customizations, just edit Thunderbird's `.bat` file and comment out or delete all the lines mentioning the custom config files.\n\n3. Microsoft Offline Updates - built using the excellent [WSUS Offline](http://download.wsusoffline.net/) tool. Please donate to them if you can, their team does excellent work.\n\n------------------------------------------\n\n##Integrity\n\nIn the folder `\\integrity verification` the file `checksums.txt` is signed with [my PGP key](http://pool.sks-keyservers.net:11371/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x07D1490F82A211A2) (0x07d1490f82a211a2, pubkey included). You can use this to verify package integrity.\n\nIf you find a bug or glitch, PM me or post it here. Advice and comments are welcome and appreciated.\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nDonations (bitcoin): \n\n`1Bfxpo1WqTGwRXZKrwYZV2zvJ4ggyj9GE1`\n\nDonations (Monero): \n\n`46ZUK4VDLLz3zapDw62UaS71ZfFBjH9uwhc8FeyocPhUHHsuxj5zfvpZpZcZFHWpxoXD99MVt6PnR9QfftXDV8s6CFAnPSo`\n\n*[^\"Do ^not ^withhold ^good ^from ^those ^to ^whom ^it ^is ^due, ^when ^it ^is ^in ^your ^power ^to ^act.\"](http://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-27.htm)*",

However...I can't seem to get it to do it.\n\nI've tried Windows DHCP (where it was all running before) and the Meraki MX64's DHCP servers which also don't seem to serve it up either.\n\nWhat in the hell am I do wrong? I'm re-reading all the dummies guides and again, I thought I had it all figured out correctly, and yet here I am! \n\nWould appreciate a sanity check, and don't feel bad for an ELI5 approach, I may need it in my fog right now.\n\nEdit: man, it's just a weird day for my brain.\n\nI just collapsed my subnets back down to vlans.\n\nI know Meraki is working. Something is either up with the smc on the other end or the esxi host itself. Haven't had a good change to much with either.\n\n\nEdit: finally was able to properly troubleshoot last night.\n\nWas esxi. Had to enable promiscuous mode. Also centos (sanfoma Linux in this case) wasn't playing nicely with vlans so had to force vlan5 for one guest in addition to forcing the primary nic in that guest to be vlan5 (sub interface method refused to work for incoming).",

I've set up similar policies in other domains in the past (and we have another FGPP applied to a different set of users that works fine), but I'm absolutely stumped on this one.\n\nThe fine-grained policy has a different Maximum Age value than the Default Domain Policy.  The users I want to apply the policy to are direct members of a global security group called **TestFGPP**.  The FGPP is directly applied to this group. If I run `Get-AdUserResultantPasswordPolicy` on a user in this group, I can see that the FGPP is correctly applied.  However, when I run `net user <username> /domain`, the password expiration is clearly being determined from the Default Domain Policy, and not the FGPP.  If a user in this group is approaching the Max Age value of the Default Domain Policy, they will get the \"Your password will expire in x days\", despite the FGPP's Max Age being a much different value.\n\nI've deleted and recreated the security group and the FGPP and have the same results.  Everything I've read says that a FGPP will take precedence over the GPO password settings, but that's not the case here.  What am I missing? ",

I did not particularly enjoy MSP work as it just didn't give me any satisfaction on a deep level to work break/fix or even new build outs for people I had no stake with.  Just wasn't my cup of tea personally, but I will say I learned a lot.  I don't even know how I got my first job doing contract work for a MSP doing basic tier 1-2 desktop work, but I suppose they liked the Army background and I had some experience as I had built my own PC etc, but I had zero knowledge of business infrastructure and server OS'/AD/etc.  I moved on from that job into other MSP roles and over the last 3 years or so have grown into what they would call more of a \"systems engineer\" but that type of work was often reserved for people above my paygrade, understandably.  I got to build some cool tech and do a lot of server work, but again it was pretty unsatisfying overall due to the MSP model.\n\nWell, gentlemen(and ladies), yesterday I accepted a job offer as a real life Systems Administrator(it was on the title page) for a privately owned financial firm with around 70-100 employees.  I'll admit to being a little nervous as I'll basically be running the show, but I am up to the task.  I'd appreciate any guidance as far as entering a brand new environment that I will have complete control over as that is a brand new concept for me, at least from a planning point of view.  I am new to budgeting and purchasing and that side of things for sure but I know that is going to be part of my job.  Appreciate everyone's feedback and posts over the years in this sub as it has definitely assisted in leading me to where I am right now, which is right where I want to be.  Thanks guys.",

They live all over the big city, and due to the nature of the jobs, are scheduled for 4 hour windows for arrival. A single stop takes anywhere from 15-40 minutes, and so the four hour windows need to be overlapping. \n\nCurrently we have to contact every client by phone. We are in the process of collecting functioning emails for all of our clients, but it will be a while before we can rely on email for our main method of communication. As we need to confirm appointments with every client, the 1600 phone calls and scheduling time are taking over 80 hours of work, and with a single person office staff, that requires us to hire someone else and train them. More hours again. We would like to cut that down. \n\nThe complication I'm having while working with Doodle and Google Calendar is that the clients need to be given overlapping windows of times of which they can choose a couple or three. Not every client gets the same windows of opportunity to choose from, as each sub section of the city gets its own area of time. And \nthe final order of bookings within those windows depends on driving routes so that our service technician isn't driving circles all over that day's area. \n\nIdeally I would like to be able to send clients a link which would only show them the time options afforded to their address. They could then pick a few time slots, and the program would sort it out so that everyone was put into groups accordingly and confirm the clients windows of time by email. (we would still have to call clients wthout valid emails.) If there's a driving time function somewhere that would be amazing, but I imagine the final order of the groupings would have to be done by someone who knows the roads, or on google maps.\n\nWe will still have to call each of our clients, but perhaps we could direct them to online scheduling and nudge them aboard. \n\nAnyways, asking you guys if there's a program out there that could do this stuff for us. \n\nThanks\n",

I work for an American company in Germany and the American bosses are slowly finding out the hard way that American labor law is not the law for the entire world.\n\nThey are asking us to work an off the record comp time schedule, meaning that while our contracts say 40 hrs a week, they want us to be able to work at all hours. We must be reachable all the time and do on-call work.\n\nThe on-call work would be a rotation and would be \"compensated\" 1 for 1 (not really). What I mean by that is that we would theoretically be given an extra hour off work for every hour spent actually on a call. In reality we have NO way of tracking this (again because it would show were working illegally) and there is a large opportunity for work to screw us. If we don't take the comp time immediately, our bosses could \"forget\" that we have the credit.\n\nI also believe that inactive time spent on call in Germany needs to be compensated because you are not exactly \"off work\" if you are expected to be always by the phone and computer. Not to mention that my hours after hours and on the weekend are more valuable to me than my 9-5 hours each weekday.\n\nMany of the American workers will do on-call at 3 am and still be expected to show up in the office at 9am. Here in Germany I know the law requires 11 he break between work periods.\n\nMy boss is trying to argue that the laws were written for factory workers and so it makes no sense for them to apply to us as IT people, but he's not the fucking law and court system of Germany.\n\nI cannot go to HR and talk about this because we do not have real HR in Germany. Our HR department here is made up of people who were never trained as German HR professionals. They're either interns, office admins, or young 20 something recruiters working in HR.

It would use that number to create a connection to the hidden wireless network. \n\nNormally, to connect, on the Windows 10 laptop, I go to Wi-Fi/Manage Known Network, then hit \"Add a new network.\" Then I use the SSID which is Company-1234, select \"WPA2-Personal AES\", type the passphrase, then select the boxes for \"Connect Automatically\" and \"Connect even if this network is not broadcasting.\"\n\nI could not get NETSH WLAN to do the job, but I may be missing something.

            "selftext": "Hey guys,\n\nI've been doing some reading on Branch Cache & DFS-R, and had a few questions - wondering what you all are using.\n\nI have 2 offices that are a few hundred miles apart. Both offices work on the same projects. Currently, my file server is in my Main office, and my Branch office is on a Site-to-Site VPN and all their files are stored in my Main office - they do not have a local server.\n\nIn the next few weeks I will be implementing Windows Server 2016 in my Main Office, and sending a server to my Branch office with 2016 on it as well. \n\nIdeally, my 2 offices would have the same copies of each file, each office would work off their own set, and the servers would write the changes in the background. DFS-R was what I was planning on using but the lack of a file lock seems to be a big turn off for me.  Similarly, Branch-Cache looks like it will respect a file lock, but the 'write back' is done to the remote server, so my Branch users will still have to wait when saving large files (just not when opening them).\n\nIs there a good 'in-between' of these tools? I've seen the 3rd party tools like Peerlock, but have read mixed things about them. I figure if I have to, I'll stick with DFS-R, and inform users that they can't work on the same file across the network, and teach them about the conflict folder. I do also have Office 365 for every user and have read a little into sharepoint, but I don't think management would go for that over the traditional file system in Windows.",

We have our sales staff and they are in the field most of the time, problem is like all sales jobs we have wicked turn over and sometimes these wonderful people wipe their systems or destroy them or have them stolen or ran over with their rental cars etc etc etc. So, I said to the director, we need to start storing all their data internally, map their Documents to their personal share and back up that share to stop this nightmare. She agreed, however she wanted to know if they could have offline files, I said sure but then they would never connect to the VPN so it would be moot at that point. \n\nIt looks like we have a subscription to Moxy (Dell) and we could utilize this as a solution. However, it seems so wasteful to not utilize our data center (brand new) because the sales can't be bothered to connect to the VPN or they want off line files and will never sync. What would be used as a solution when there is no connection to the net, will be the way they always use it given this option....I know these people.\n\nWe are not using the Ultimate OS version of Windows, so I can't utilize that slick DirectAccess MS put out. It just has to force them to use the VPN, and will allow local saves when no Internet is available and auto sync when their connection is restored. \n\nBonus sales story, we had a manager who was on the East, she just got one of her sales person who was termed cars back. Which means she now had two cars, breaking with protocol of being in person during terms, the director termed this sales girl over the phone. She drove on car to an airport in short term parking and mailed the keys back with no information. Then did the same with the other car in another State with the same thing. Something about a woman scorned? =D\n\nThanks!",

I need some help.\n\nI've got a machine, Windows Server 2008 R2. Fresh install. After the system runs for awhile the CPU usage will sky rocket. All being used by \"powershell.exe\". This machine is running PRTG (Network Monitor) and has never had much usage of Power Shell. So It's not an application *i am* running. After whatever script this is runs long enough the machine will BSOD and reboot. Only to do it again a few hours later. Process explorer shows this process tied to WmiPrvSE.exe. I've run AVG, Malware bytes, Windows defender (After installing the desktop experience package) as well as TrendMicro's quick scan. Nothing finds any viruses or malware..etc.\n\nNow, Let me throw a wrench into this whole thing. It's not just one machine. It's eight. Six are Xen Server virtual machines. Two are physical machines. They're all Server 2008 Standard, or Server 2008 R2 Standard. And they're all in the same subnet. Other servers (Linux, As you might imagine, Windows server 2003, Win 7, Win 10) are unaffected. Other machines of similar build in different subnets are unaffected.\n\nGiven the data, I'm quite sure this is some kind of Virus/Malware. I just can't for the life of me find out how to get rid of it. Any pointers?",

            "selftext": "Hiya!\n\nI have a strange issue with a Synology NAS. This is a Windows Domain Network with about 30 users in a single subnet. When browsing the mapped NAS file system as a network drive in Windows File Explorer, it usually works pretty nicely, but sometimes opening a folder hangs for a long time and the Windows address bar shows the green progress indicator loading. It's not a specific folder. Could be just about any random folder. All load statistics on the NAS look ok.\n\nWhen analyzing the hang-up with Wireshark, there's an SMB2 Create Request File for the folder in question and some 30 secs later there's a Create Response File with STATUS_SUCCESS. There is an unexpected Tree Disconnect Request originating from the client and a subsequent response. After that the files seem to load.\n\nI've tried messing with Opportunistic Lock / Lease settings in the Synology SMB settings but that doesn't seem to affect much.\n\nI've also done a switch port mirror for the NAS to check out if it's maybe waiting for authentication from a Domain Controller or something else, but couldn't see anything relevant.\n\nNone of the network equipments seem to be overloaded either. There are a bunch of HP switches involved.\n\nHere's a list of what's been tried so far and other remarks in no particular order:\n\n* Different SMB2 oplock/lease settings from Synology NAS settings.\n* Disabling Large Send Offload V2 (both IPv4 and IPv6) on client NIC\n* Lots of Wireshark captures from both client to NAS and a switch port mirroring of the NAS. Nothing out of ordinary detected except for the long delay. There's other traffic coming through during the wait. Barely any traffic is leaving our subnet when accessing files stored on the NAS. The Domain Controller is in another subnet.\n* Disabling antivir on a client\n* Restricting Maximum Transfer Unit to 1500 on switches and the NAS to make sure it's compliant with all our devices. One of our switches is reporting \"runts/giants\". This isn't really a change, but is now set explicitly so nothing should try anything funny with jumbo packets. They're known to cause issues if not configured poperly.\n* Problem not limited to Windows File Explorer. Presents itself even using Windows PowerShell.\n* Disabling all the other NICs both physical and virtual on a client\n* There definitely seems to be an utilization/load component to the problem, as the problem is barely reproduceable outside of working hours \n* Tested Samba access on a Linux box with smb://NAS and the problem is not nearly as pronounced as on Windows. There was a single slight wait of about 5 - 10 secs.\n* Checked network throughput during a hang-up with \u00b4iperf\u00b4 and it's nominal for a gigabit network\n* Resource monitoring on the NAS doesn't show any bottlenecks\n* Similar behavior happens on a Windows 7 client as opposed to a Win10 client\n* Disabling IPv6 on a client\n* Changing the Windows drive mapping from \\NAS\\Common to \\<IP>\\Common. At first this seemed to help, but it later turned out it didn't.\n* Different Windows registry tweaks to no avail\n\nAny ideas of further things to check or further info I could provide?",

There are ~500 users and they are spread out across 20 sites.  The file server is centralized out of the data center, no local servers.  The solution needs to be transparent to the user, which is why I dont think folder redirection will work - will affect performance.  This leaves me with another option, which is to sync their profile folders across to a share.  I've come across a profileunity tool that can perform asynchronous sync, at interval, in the background.  The tool is designed for VDI's, as it does many other cool profile management tasks, but i think it will work in this instance and should be seamless for the users. It also works via GPOs.

            "selftext": "Below is my plan for our windows file server and GPO migration plan. Please let me know if anything stands out or there are any gotchas that I'm missing.\n\n\nCurrent Setup:\n\nNetwork shares are on the os drive of a DC and are being mapped to users via group policy logon script. Permissions for the shares are a combination of share and ntfs permissions, with most shares given full control to default users container.\n\nMigration Plan:\n\nStand up a dedicated file server. Add non system drive storage and copy data from old network shares. Create a DFS namespace on this file server and use folder targets to point to shares. For permissions, give everyone full control on share permissions. Two security groups per share, a read/write/modify and a read only group and assign appropriate ntfs permissions for each share. Create one drive map GPO (replace action) per share and use item level targeting with new security groups to map shares. Disable logon script drive map GPO and enable newly created GPOs. \n\nHere is where I'm unsure how to proceed. Should we run gpupdate /force on each machine and force users to logoff/logon, or just ask them to logoff/logon when they get a chance, or something else?\n\n\nI'm probably missing some other things, but thats why I'm asking you guys for help!

            "selftext": "Hey all,\n\nI need help renewing a certificate.  It is on a CentOS server that runs our ticket system (OSTicket), and expires in a couple days.  I have been shoed-in as the sysadmin after our previous guy left.  I was just a help-desk support type person, but am now basically in charge of all sysadmin/network admin roles.\n\nI happened to be looking through his emails and saw he had an email from certwatch warning that the certificate was going to expire soon, and it could be renewed through genkey.  I have extremely limited knowledge of Linux, and a beginner with certificates too.  I do know the certificate is signed by my CA (which is on a DC running server 2012).\n\nI opened up the terminal on the server and loaded up genkey.  I'm unsure which options I need to use after that.   There are a couple options mentioning a CA cert.  There's \"--makeca\" which is to \"Generate a self-signed certificate for a CA\".  And then there is \"--cacert\" which says \"Renewal is for a CA certificate, needed for openssl certs only\".  Then after one of those, I assume I need to use the \"--renew\" option also?  \n\nOnce this part has been done, I'm also unsure how to go about making sure the cert is signed by my CA.\n\nSorry for the newbie questions, and thank you for your help!",

We have some VMs with Public IP for hosted services and everything works for that part. Even our VMs on the internal network are working fine and they're able to use internet with a SNAT rule. My problem is that i'm trying to make the VPN use AD authentication and my NSX edge gateway is unable to ping my AD DC server even though this DC is using the NSX as a gateway. The AD DC server is unable to ping it's gateway too but is able to use it just fine.\n\nI made a graph to discribe our current infrastructure. One thing to note is that the NSX is able to ping my server on the other side of our IPsec tunnel and vice versa. I'm pretty new to VMware NSX and virtual network appliances in general. Can you point me out what's wrong?\n\nThanks and have a great day!!\n\n\n\n\n[The link to the graph](https://www.draw.io/?lightbox=1&highlight=0000ff&edit=_blank&layers=1&nav=1&title=Untitled%20Diagram.xml#R7Vtbc9o4FP41zOw%2BhMFXzGMgt84kLdO02ewTI2xhtDEWlWUg%2FfU9smWwLZOQBNvJZEkTpKOrz%2FnORUduxxgtNpcMLec31MNBR%2B95m45x1tF1zTR68CUojynFtgcpwWfEk512hFvyG0uiHOfHxMNRoSOnNOBkWSS6NAyxyws0xBhdF7vNaFBcdYl8rBBuXRSo1H%2BIx%2BeSqvV6u4YrTPy5XNqxZMMUuQ8%2Bo3Eo1%2Bvoxiz5pM0LlM0l%2B0dz5NF1jmScd4wRo5SnpcVmhAPB24xt6biLPa3bfTMc8kMG2APszvDMtVxTw6bunujpDCsUxJIXX0KOWYi53DB%2FzJhEFgkXh3O%2BCICiQTFAUxwMtzwY0YCypHPGBWMoR52RhQ%2FbCsgU%2FroBWU4QgyUuYKE1ZQ8kFK2jgMbeRNOdDfx2l0AzhsnE2JMLbvnXg4pLF8SV5Ygz%2BoBzG%2Bgln21LJlbg%2BHBGgiDX8yL5CDoNucSmrst61YzJU49pRDihIbS5WLAMGlaYcQKoui514HQJrSggfmX3U9kwpZzTBTSoUpWCFiPwJkeSUr7EdIE5e4QustU2JeKkRuqOrK93%2BM5I8zyyJQ1JjfK3M%2B9QBQUJrD2otBXsYA%2F0TVYp43Pq0xAF5ztqTs69IsbwhvD7XPlf0aXbt0Q1hJ3dyyFJJW3UReN%2FmPNHKU4Ucwqk3crXVIgkmXMvsyMaM1fu35JGCTEfy179lCSe7EmBMBwgTlZFS%2FMW9lqKyn69vQfC%2BUYoLhJd%2F1rj6d%2FwnejyDMFT6L0T%2BL1dE%2B7OExRw8TWOpwGoEHQcRy3oe7qdgsK%2FHfmGUUS%2BpjeI%2FH79yNefQn7%2F6Mi33xHy7T3IT11Wgvwy4q%2BpL0xsDvvvAeUfw4eUNck0G9QkNTA5pmodVUWOrg9y6JgSWHXn0q2iOAy9xOdUR%2BWoEqu32ziI%2B5mPOa4dy7y2NGXaE3bMsLP6GDMCOxdgTzrVIbm8cctw1rx16%2B%2Fz62InzZut7zQGrk%2B%2BwJnrA9ouc9Be%2FLvd7QewXdqgGePV15szXkY9xkvfa7y0VoxXJrr3Yb0Msw6uF0PflwS3ucO85ryFpYbRFkuz3eTsyM8p%2BRWDWQXqz5DMxPctdmNGuNjBJeJ4jURpzOj%2FLuOFLsPptegyKvJw4wiLo%2Fnd%2BCv8%2FRGHoUi6lmTqoWhepT%2FRHC1Fl8XGFxnbLlpHRne1DCcyg5owWUmEWY4FamwMYYxH8C75FdIQv0aIW%2Bk8K8dU3EcQom1pRT8z0BUhWk7XUsVoOkcQo3pC%2FRYzIFxh5P2KQWWwqH2bzYirxnTwiLwoRoYj8htNkw5CwsLgRdKo5dga4Bnfy9RoiVxQzx%2BJZTwR4l0KJ5s8pTXsWGeZsZQbeZHxfIF22SXtUpVLMyu0qxwnvEoszgEBWeidipuEHdy3uqUVhXIwc571GHlMVjx6RnvrudEpcd4ssTT1gEro9exEWn0hnOr5PpPA%2BoMCn51XC6w0kdm36pJYlirKW767qyQSISsIS6CU3O500rTc3c0a2A%2BFLIE3YyjiLHZ5zD6ZYSxf1Kh20ezVZBez0FZxVwFNc6YRZqvEYzGIERWx1BJQunSxFFFkJDKnyfKT7zDfZAzNBAWluDIvD%2BM48hiUHVWDYaB51ERB3TdnBzM%2Ff8QyKq7S7APN7%2FEPrepd2h1hPE7Af4PcOQmzi4SObgfClkxBHWxflE7Pkk5RGtOdjZrRj4oLc6km0tLWryHOnlROEwoyqF9Bnrxgq18%2FKi7c2tMP9TzzWVFuWg2ivIFc2vGukV8H84qrl%2FZgrl69fFaYW0ZzMDfUU17uJl%2FrdeEf%2FMA04o2i3teUWaojzr0EkN78X%2BwSoSTKTaUpUlVPFjWwWC%2FdRVkV9%2BhVx0njGKZEPZcVeawfxuNreSJIU7ydfK45Y7HeIoudLJJrg8UNvPTTbsxuVsTsVlvG2lRj9raNddNGuskTqdNyKFI%2FuCsC7vbArQbcyoE06ryX9zdbVQLNrk0LoLp7JT9Nhu7%2B34Nx%2Fgc%3D)",

They were using students for cold calling with very high staff rotation.\n\nObviously I felt this was not right so I got a lawyer involved (I'm really thankful I got her to write up my service contract) and together we got them shut down **hard**.\n\nI was wondering if anyone else in a similar position has had to do the same in the past before and how it worked out for them ? \n\n",

            "selftext": "If any of your users, company or organization is using software from NCH Software, you should take precautions as they are not trustworthy. \n\nI would be cautious to run software that comes from them based on how they operate their business. Initially, this was a supposed Australian company yet this company does not work in Australia as far I'm aware. Its some guys from India or Pakistan if memory serves me right. Try reaching someone or asking support and you will confirm this (maybe I'm wrong and that is their outsourced team...). They now have a supposed US office, but I don't think I was ever able to reach anyone either. Try to see how hard they make it contact them on their site and that alone should raise flags. They keep hiding information as much as they can when it comes to reaching someone.\n\nSecond but more interesting is that they defraud users by selling supposed owned software and then bumping the versions forcing them to pay for upgrades without any actual changes in the software. (fake upgrades).\n\nPlease see the following example:\nhttp://www.nch.com.au/ivm/versions.html\n\nTook a screenshot in case they decide to change it:\nhttps://imgur.com/a/Q78qx\n\nThey didn't even bother to update the changelog because if you make a comparison between the older version released and the supposed new ones, there are no changes in the software. They just bump the version number every couple of months so that licensed users are forced to upgrade (paying) for basically no changes at all. Their installers always default to the latest version.\n\nThis would be usually fine if someone can install an older release but here comes the trick:\nhttp://www.nch.com.au/kb/10208.html\n\n\"Unfortunately, if you have not backed up the software you initially purchase, you cannot revert back to the older version. We do not keep copies of older version software because the cost we would need to charge you for the service exceeds the upgrade cost.\"\n\nScreenshot:\nhttps://imgur.com/a/OrTzC\n\nThey also do not let you deactivate or re-use serials. In case you activated a software before, you are forced to pay it again if your system dies.\n\nDoes anyone in their right mind even believe this? That a software company in 2017 can't have a couple of hundred Megabytes of server space for previous releases? Even if a user keeps an older installer release offline, it is a dummy installer that always downloads the latest version from their site. You don't get an installer per release, so if you saved the one with a purchase, it would just download the latest version forcing you to upgrade as your licenses are only valid for six months (3 months in the past).\n\nI have detected all sort of sketchy things this company is doing, not only with the way they operate but also what they put in their software.\n\nBe aware as at least one of their sound software seems to be a very popular download on the Internet, and you can't trust a software if you cannot trust the person behind it. The way they operate with paid customers (you can find tons of complaints on Google by searching rip-off or fraud with their name involved) should raise even more flags.\n\nJust a warning to fellow system admins. You do not want malware installed in the future with some update they release, and this would not surprise me based on how they are tricking people to pay for fake upgrades. Even they Justice department investigated them for fraud before:\n\nhttps://www.justice.gov/criminal-fraud/file/899121/download\n\nI have received more than one complaint from users, so I decided to research what the problem was and the more I did, the more I found that I should block them or hit uninstall for software that comes from NCH.",

            "selftext": "Hello\n\nI've been trying to find a solution to this problem for a day and a half now, but don't seem to be able to get it going. Maybe someone with more experience here has had to deal with this in the past.\n\nI've recently started working in a company where they basically bootstrapped their entire IT infrastructure with a lot of consumer solutions. One of them was a home user grade QNAP NAS.\n\nI swapped the NAS out with a fileserver running linux. Everything seems to be working quite nicely so far, permissions have been solved very quickly but one problem persists and I can't seem to find the solution.\n\nOpen any document with any other program than MS Office and it gets opened straight from the network share. Open it with a MS Office program, and it gets downloaded first and gets opened in protected view. This behavior wasn't present on the previous NAS, which was also running linux with samba.\n\nMy only guess so far is that there's some setting in samba.conf that I'm missing that marks the files as \"not trusted\" in Office. \n\nI've already added the location to Trust Center locations, have enabled trust network files and such, so it shouldn't be a local settings issue.\n\nThe only thing I can think of is some server side configuration issues. As mentioned the old NAS didn't manifest these issues. \n\nEDIT: Seem to have solved it somewhat. The files are no longer being opened in protected view, but they still get downloaded locally first. In my smb4.conf I had the vfs object streams_xattr active. After truning this off, restarting samba and reconnecting the clients I can now open files without them being in protected view.  ",

Layoff 14 got me though, but I managed to find a new position before my last day.  And I've been there for the last 2 years, working my ass off in my new role with exceptional reviews from my boss.\n\nThe project I worked on over the summer would have completely failed had I not been part of it.  We moved a major application from Windows to Linux, and I was the only person on the team with any Linux experience.  After working 60 hours weeks most of the summer, and taking a whole 2 days off all summer, the project is wrapping up this Thursday and I was quite proud of myself.\n\nThen I saw the same shit happen that happened before.  An email came out today that 2 senior managers had left the company to \"pursue other opportunities\" outside the company and effective immediately, all their direct reports now report to someone new.  This is exactly how senior management always gets fired around here.\n\nThe I find out my team has been re-orged.  We were literally cut off from one org in the company and slapped onto another org, one which has a team very similar to ours, just supporting a different geographic region.  Our two teams probably have 90% overlap in skills and responsibilities.\n\nIf this is anything like the last pattern, the next thing that will happen is either my direct manager or his manager will be let go and we'll be merged with our counterpart team.  Then they'll cull the herd and let people go where there is overlap.\n\nSince my management chain will be let go first, none of the hard work I did will be worth anything when they evaluate whether I should stay or go.  I'll simply be a salary on a spreadsheet.\n\nSorry, just needed to vent.  Really annoyed because I LOVE my boss.  I love my team.  It's amazing how we just have each other's back.  I tell the team I need to take off from 3-5 PM on Wednesday, because I need to go to my son's school for something, and BAM, they got me covered.  And vice versa.  We're like a well oiled machine providing 24x7 support and keeping the people we support very happy while we cover each other's backs so that every one has a half-decent work-life balance.\n\nBut some bean counter isn't going to care about any of that.\n\nI expect more senior management layoffs to happen in the near future.  The last time this happened, my entire management chain, all the way to the CIO was let go in a little over a month, a few every week.\n\nOk, I'm done here.  Thanks for listening to my rant.",

There are various reasons given, such as 'it's better to have everyone in the office to keep them up to date' etc etc, but I feel this isn't relevant if you're only working from home one day a week (for example). Besides, there are the various ticketing systems, chat systems etc which mean that daily changes/issues are visible to everyone. It seems daft to have to go into the office where I'm going to sit with my headphones on for 80-90% of the day, but discourage remote working on the grounds of 'communications'. \n\nWhat're people's thoughts on the matter?",

            "selftext": "Happy Monday all. We are using Veeam Agent for Windows 2.0 on a physical server, which is backing up locally to a Synology NAS (full image is ~250GB). I was thinking of a way to bypass Cloud Connect (no support for multiple jobs in VAW, also budget reasons). \n\nBefore 2.0, I did not think this was possible, as the \"forever incremental\" backup scheme would cause problems. Since (after the retention period) the full image would continually consume the subsequent/adjacent incremental, this would cause multiple incompatible versions of the full file, creating a break in the chain. I hope this makes sense. \n\nAs I understand it, version 2.0 supports a traditional periodic full/incremental scheme. With this in mind, I was hoping to use the Synology Blackblaze B2 integration to automatically backup the image files. This way during a restore I could just download the files from B2 and have a longer retention period than my local backups. \n\nMy other issue is that VAW only supports one backup job, so I cant make a local backup AND a Cloud Connect backup through the agent. Guessing I need VBR for that.\n\nHas anyone tried this B2 backup plan? Any reason it might not work? Any help is appreciated, thanks!",

I am having problems with the new 2012 servers only being able to support a fraction of the users that were supported on the same hardware, running the same application on 2003. The 2003 servers were able to support 40-60 users before the users started complaining things were slow. On the 2012 servers, users complain of slowness by the time we hit about 20 users.\n\nSetup is as follows:\n1 broker VM (on seperate hardware) managing all the terminal servers.\n6 physical servers, each with 8x2012 R2 terminal server VM's running our standalone app. The physical servers are the same physical servers that previously hosted the 2003 terminal servers. So the hardware is all the same, the host OS has been updated from 2008 to 2012 R2 now, and the guests are now all 2012 R2. \n\nUsers connect via RDWeb and access their application as a RemoteAPP.\n\nI can't figure out why the servers are running so much differently now that we're on a RDS Farm as opposed to a standard NLB farm using 2003 old technology. This is all hyper-v. I've turned off CPU/Network/Disk fairshare. \n\nAnyone out there with experience with RemoteAPP farms found success with any performance? I'd be happy to entertain any ideas.

            "selftext": "For some reason there was a large request for a script I wrote for terminated users. Original Topic here: https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/737z79/how_do_you_handle_your_o365_offboarding/\n\nI figured I would create a new thread so I can highlight everything all out.  There's two scripts actually, but the one I'm posting now does the first part of our process.  This may not work for you, everyone's process is different. However, what we do is, ticket gets submitted to HR, we run the script which does a bulk of things, ticket gets updated, calendar reminder sent out and thats the end of it (keeping in mind email forward is setup, etc).  90 days comes around and by this time the manager has had enough of the forwards and hes gotten mostly what he needs. We then process another extent of the termination.  I run the 90day post cleanup script which moves the user to a nonsyncing OU (365), and creates the 365 search for PST exportation and fires off an email to our team that I ran it with the details.  We then download the pst and the terminated has been fully committed.  Once that AD user is in a non-syncing OU, 365 treats it as such and moves that user to deleted users in the cloud where its kept for I think 30 days.\n\nPlease keep in mind this is GUI based. At the time I thought it would be cool. lol\n\nHere is what this does;  \n**AD stuff first**  \n* Disables the user (if you check it off)  \n* Loops through membership and removes from all groups (besides domain users!)  \n* Adds a no GFI group to the user (this can be removed for you or changed to your liking)  \n* Sets some attributes title to todays date (manager, company and department get nulled out)  \n* Resets/Sets the users password (this can be changed)  \n* Moves the account to a temporary Disabled Users OU (still syncs with 365) so we can keep their shared mailbox, account, etc  for 90 days until post cleanup  \n* Hides the user from the GAL  \n  \n**365 stuff**  \n* Removes the user license  \n* Converts the user to a shared mailbox (so we can still access it)  \n* Sets up the forward (if you typed in an email address)  \n* Fires off the outlook process, composes the calendar reminder with all variables you entered.  \n* We use webhelpdesk, then it fires off email to webhelpdesk with all information to add to ticket. You dont have to do anything!!  \n  \n\nPlease keep in mind, theres no doubt you'll have to alter this a bit to fit your process, but at least the bulk of the code is here and works great.  There is no error checking, so if for example you put in your wrong ad credentials up front, you will get alot of red errors. Also to note; theres a bunch of variables that you need to change like DOMAIN and COMPANYNAME, your AD OU's, etc. Opening it in Ultraedit works best to find these.  \n\n  \n*Any questions, I'll do my best to help.*  \n**Screenshots**   \nhttps://imgur.com/a/EGuQA  \n**Script**  \nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/h3j93dl9y5s0g43/TerminatedUserV1.3.ps1?dl=0\n  \nThere is the 90day post cleanup script which I can share as well if wanted\n\nUPDATE: Didnt think I'd get this kind of response. Wow. I'll get the 90 day posted tomorrow!  \n --------------------------------------------------- \n\n  \n  \n** **EDIT**  **  \nHere is a link below to the 90day post cleanup. Plz change all references of *\"yourdomain\"* to your fqdn.com please.  Change the word *\"DOMAIN\"* to your internal domain.  \n\n**What does this do?**  \n* When your outlook calendar reminder goes off after 90 days you run this script in powershell  \n* This script is none GUI based, only command prompt based  \n* First enter in your Domain Admin IT credentials  \n* Then afterwards it'll ask you for your office 365 global admin credentials.  Remember to use FQDN!  \n* Then it'll ask you for the username of the terminated user. Enter in just their username  **(example: first initial, lastname)**  \n* It'll ask you to confirm one last time, then it'll do the work!  \n* First it'll move the user from Disabled Users to \"To Be Deleted\" or whatever your OU is. This is a non-syncing OU with 365. Dont forget to set this in your Azure sync tool!  \n* Here is what my OU looks like:  https://imgur.com/a/7wgEv  \n* It will create the ediscovery search, where you can download the pst.    \n* Then it will fire off an email.  Post cleanup is now complete.  \n\n**Remember**, Once this script runs, the user goes to a whole another OU which doesnt sync wtih 365.  This essentially removes the user from the cloud and puts them in that microsoft 30day deleted container. You can still restore the user for 30 days, but for the sake of the cleanup, they are gone. This shouldnt matter though because the manager has had 90 days to get their emails, etc etc, and you now have a PST, so all bells and whistles should be covered\n\n**Script**  \nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/fn4qfoaf3pdqgyj/90daycleanup.ps1?dl=0",

Nevertheless, please feel free to leave comments, questions, concerns, etc below on at the...\n\nArticle Link: https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/askpfeplat/2017/10/02/implementing-multiple-agpm-servers/\n\n\n> Hi Everyone,\n\n> Paulo here, a Microsoft Premier Field Engineer (PFE), recently I have had several customers querying about how to deploy multiple AGPM Servers per Forest/Domain. As you know AGPM was designed to **centralize** change control over Group Policies so not exactly developed for this intended purpose.\n\n> The configuration of Group Policy in a single AGPM server scenario is straight forward\n\n> The AGPM server takes control of GPOs which copies GPOs into the AGPM archive enabling the AGPM server to control them and to do that the AGPM Service account must have Full Control over all the GPOs. Refer to my earlier AGPM related post for more information on that at https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/reference_point/2013/08/21/how-to-prevent-the-creation-of-gpos-from-outside-agpm-advanced-group-policy-management/\n\n> However, by having multiple AGPM servers each AGPM service account can only control its own subset of policies (for example having an AGPM server/service per OU, Domain or Business Unit).\n\n> Start by creating a Governing body/team which ultimately has an account which can change and create new GPOs in AD, and then they decide which AGPM Server will need to be responsible over this new Group Policy, so then they assign permissions to that new policy for the applicable AGPM service account. Channeling GPO creation through the Governing body prevents GPO creation outside of the AGPM.\n\n> Each AGPM server has only control over the policies which they can see, which obviously is controlled by permissions.\n\n> As an administrator you can create GPOs anywhere in the domain, which is a nightmare. So as business unit if you want a new policy, you must make a request to the governing body (or change control team whichever you like to call it).\n\n> They\u2019ll create the new policy and set the permissions so that your AGPM server has exclusive full control over it.\n\nContinue the article...  [HERE!!](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/askpfeplat/2017/10/02/implementing-multiple-agpm-servers/)\n\nAGPM is a very powerful tool and can be used to help provide auditing, history, tracking, rollbacks, and control of Group Policy within your environment.\n\nFor more details and the documentation around AGPM, hit up [this link.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-desktop-optimization-pack/agpm/)\n",

There are five sites with subnets and the appropriate DCs assigned in sites and services.  A 2012 R2 DC in the datacenter at our largest site holds the FSMO roles.  It's basically a hub-and-spoke topology with most resources in the main datacenter and a DC/DHCP/DNS server at each other site.  Links between the sites are all fiber, either our own point-to-point fiber at 1-10 gbps, or third party metro ethernet sorts of connections at 100-250 mbps.\n\nI notice in NTDS settings that the DCs have automatically generated replication links that make no sense.  They'll go through three other remote sites to get back to the FSMO master.  \n\nThe site links probably hadn't been touched since long before I or any of my coworkers got here and were setup strangely with old sites still listed, so I deleted them and re-created new ones (one for each remote site with just the hub and it listed) and deleted auto generated connections on a few DCs to test, but the new ones it created aren't really any better then the old ones.\n\nEverything works and replicates, so maybe it's not a big deal.  It just annoys me that it's doing what it's doing because it feels inefficient.\n\nAny idea what I'm doing wrong?  Thanks!",

Our backup appliance also reports that it is unable to get an app-consistent snapshot for the VM.\n\nUnfortunately, this particular server is a SQL server, so non-quiesced, crash-consistent snapshots are out of the question.  We have other SQL servers with Server 2008 R2 that quiesce just fine, so I'm not sure what different or broken with this guy.  I do have an open ticket with VMware, but so far they have been unable to locate anything within my vSphere environment that could be causing this, so they are now beginning to point the finger to the VM itself.\n\nBefore I start down that path, I wanted to see if anyone by chance has encountered this same or similar problem, and any advice on what to look for.\n\nThanks!",

If the updates required a reboot to install, they would do so UNLESS a user was logged in.

The problem with the latter is the user has no way of postponing the reboot if they are working on something important.

As this is a test Hyper-V and not on a domain, it's becoming more and more of a problem for certain things. I cannot find much about this issue. The problem doesn't seem to happen when unplugging the ethernet and just using wireless. Any help is appreciated.\n\nUPDATE: All resolved. Because I had a certain VPN driver on the Hyper-V host from previous tests, this seems to have conflicted with the Hyper-V Virtual Switch. Simply removed all traces of this VPN and flushed dns.

The problem occurs at one of our larger customers, they have an Exchange 2010 and we've created a dedicated user (let's call it \"ProblemUser\") whose calendar they use to track which person at what time uses which car. They have about one dozen cars and this way they can ensure that no one takes a car that is in use. This user is added in the Outlook (2010 as well) but also on mobile devices (iOS, Android) via the Outlook-App. So far so good, everything worked well for about a year. In August this year the customers server completely crashed (RAID 5 flew apart) and we had to restore the whole server (SBS 2011 with said Exchange on it) from the cloud-backup.  \nInterestingly after the restore everything seemed to work well, we've had to recreate some corrupted mailboxes but other than that everything worked. Except for one user the above mentioned ProblemUser, we've created the user new, with different name and it works in desktop Outlook but on the mobile app it keeps prompting for the passwort, sometimes every few hours, sometimes every few days. We first thought the problem was that too many ActiveSync devices were connected and applied a throttling policy, setting the device limit for EAS to 100 devices (only about 20 need to connect).  \n  \nDoes anyone have an idea what the problem could be?  \n\n  \nThank you in advance!\n  \n  \nEDIT: so I guess I haven't written this clear enough, the problem doesn't occur on desktop versions of Outlook, but only on the Outlook mobile app for iOS / Andriod.",

            "selftext": "I have a client who is using Outlook 2013 connected to an in-house Exchange 2010 server. Since a few days ago they have discovered that a lot of emails they send are having a particular external recipients address added to the CC or BCC field of the outgoing email, so this external recipient is receiving a lot of emails not intended for them. At first I assumed this was simply the client accidentally typing an incorrect name, however I've confirmed this is not the case. The weirdest part is that it happens seemingly at random - it's only happening with some emails and I can't see any sort of pattern whatsoever.\n\nI've checked the obvious:\n\n* No Outlook rules applying to any outgoing emails\n* No transport rules on the Exchange server\n* Recreated Outlook mail profile\n* No macros created in Outlook\n* No rogue Add-Ins\n\nThe only clue the client could give me is that this only started happening after they sent this external recipient an invoice from Reckon Accounts. I'm struggling to see how this could be related, as Reckon Accounts only communicates with Outlook via MAPI when you request an invoice be sent from the Reckon Accounts interface (to my knowledge). I can't see how it could be interfering with Outlook at any other time.\n\nI've created transport rules on the Exchange server to bounce-back any emails from this sender with the external recipient in question in the CC or BCC fields. A temporary measure of course, but it's at least stopping any emails accidentally going to this recipient who shouldn't be getting them.\n\nI have asked the client to try using Outlook on another workstation and also to try using OWA, but even when I get these results back I'm at a bit of a loss as to where to look next.\n\nHas anybody ever seen anything like this, or have any other ideas of how I can troubleshoot this?",

I don't know.\n\nJust something better than 2700 folders in a mailbox.\n\nCheers\n\np.s. - running idea for now is to archive the last few years which should halve the mailbox - however this leaves us with roughly 1300 folders still, outlook recommended is 500.",

(Design Premium, Master collection and others) - no installation is running twice at the same time.\n\nalso: we all have office 2010 home and business\n\nwe have the following environment: 3 pcs (win 7 x64 pro) + 7 pcs (win 10 x64 pro) + a windows server (windows server 2012 r2 standard (?) with VMware) (doing dhcp, mainly fileserver, exchange 2008, don\u00b4t know much about the rest) + a nas\n\nthe problems MAY be related, but they startet indepently. Yet they both occur regulary at the moment:\n\na) Indesign crashes often in the middle of the work for no apparent reason and on (all) different machines. I tried reinstalling multiple times. (and using the adobe cleaner tool)\n\nb) Outlook 2010 crashes often - yet only on (and on all) Win10 machines. We\u00b4ve tried deleting the .ost-files, activating/deactivating the exchange-cache-mode, disallow offline access and delete it - no help. Fun fact: when the cache-mode is enabled, the local .ost-files rebuilding locally vary in size between 3 and 40 GB (on different machines). But: the all use the same user@...local-login.(All PCs share the same user@... account for logging into exchange - so we are all \"user@\"...)\n\nOur admin has defragmented our exchange database (which needed repair, errors were found and corrected) - no difference. Funny thing is, one user can SOMETIMES make outlook crash by opening a PDF file, another SOMETIMES by opening a bunch of images in the preview. Yet on all others it just crashes 3 to 6 times a day.\n\nAnother fact: on most machines (yet not on all) the mapped network shares sometimes don\u00b4t show immediately when logging into our domain. After a couple of minutes they\u00b4re mostly there, but sometimes they also disappear during the day - yet if this happens, the shares don\u00b4t disconnect, they\u00b4re at all times accessible, but it\u00b4s just that their symbol in the windows explorer disappears (or appears late after logging in)\n\nEach PC has a unique username for logging in into our domain.\n\nAll Win10 machines have Donotspy installed...\n\nAny ideas, anyone?",

So we have Word, Excel, Visio, and image files (about 2 gigs of files total). For now we are storing those in a personal OneDrive account which is not a good solution. Also the files are kind of a mess because a lot of people update them or add new files. We do have folders but since we don't really have a structure it's hard to keep things organized. I was looking into a documentation system that would solve all our problems but so far I haven't found the right fit.\nThe thing is that our budget is extremely low (maybe 500$ or 100$ a year). That rules out most of the solutions. I liked Confluence a lot but too expensive for us. Also it provides more features than we need, I thought that it would really force us to have something neatly organized. I was looking into business versions of OneDrive, Google Drive, Box,... but we can't afford them since you have to pay per user and we have about 25 users. Also they don't solve our need to have a structure for our files. We do have a file server so I guess we could store the files on our premise. But I am not sure if it would be easy for the users to have a VPN every time they need to access the files. Also it would only solve our storing problem and not our organizational problem.\nHave you found any solution that worked for you?",

It's pretty straightforward to set them up, but it takes a long time to do because you're basically repeating that simple task of setting up one printer with the correct IP address,  giving it a name, selecting the right drivers etc. Then on top of that, because of the type of ID badges we print, we also need to set print defaults (such as orientation, number of copies, margin size etc) on each and every printer on the network,  so one simple 60 second task turns into an entire hour or more of enrolling printers on a network. \n\nI don't know much about administration of networks, but I'm assuming there must be a shortcut, for example a way that we can simply tell Windows how many printers are on our network, what make/model/driver to use for each one, and what print defaults to use for each one, and then just feed it the IP address for each and have it install them all? \n\nIf anyone has any tips (or could direct me to the kind of Reddit forum that might\u2026)  I would be most grateful as it would definitely earn me some sweet brownie points with this client :-) ",

Prior to June of this year, my slice of the IT pie invovled supporting Windows boxes.  But we moved a bunch of servers from Windows to RHEL 6.8 (don't even get me started on the fight to try to get them to let us use RHEL 7, that we ultimately lost).\n\nTurns out that all tasks scheduled on the server that are not system default scheduled actions done by the install need to be done through a tool called Auto Sys, by Computer Associates.\n\nSo, being the natural pain in the ass that I am, when I'm trying to get something done quickly, and some other team drops a huge roadblock in front of me, I need to ask why we chose to buy a whole other product, create a department for it, maintain support resources, etc, just to schedule actions on the server.\n\nAnd I'm told that:\n\n\"Cron is incredibly unreliable.  Stuff we schedule to run, just doesn't run sometimes.  You can't trust cron.\"\n\nNow I've been using Linux in some form, either personally or professionally since 1996.  And I have never had a cron job fail to run, unless I screwed up the crontab.  I've had scripts fail on me and not do what they're supposed to do.  But they do actually run.  I don't know if I'm one of the lucky ones, or if I am being fed a load of crap here.\n\nAnd then I am told that any test servers we have, I can only schedule jobs to run for 30 days, and then they're disabled, because we're paying \"per job\" to Computer Associates.  When I told them I needed a script to run every minute to check for files in a directory, and if it sees them, to move it to another directory, they just about had a heart attack.  Then they told me Auto Sys doesn't support increments smaller than 15 minutes.\n\nSo, a couple of questions:\n\n1. Has anyone had reliability issues with cron?\n2. Does anyone use Auto Sys?  Other than a centralized console and alerting and reporting, does Auto Sys offer any other advantages over cron (or Windows Scheduler - we use on our Windows servers also)\n3. If you do use Auto Sys, are you paying per job run?  That's seems like an incredibly strange licensing model that would get expensive pretty quickly.",

This means physical displays connected to GPU outputs, separate mouse/keyboard and USB controllers(though it'd be possible to forward USB devices in some cases or use something like Synergy for input across multiple machines), there is no client/server in the sense of going through a network or remote connections. It requires you to be physically there with the connected peripherals to use(bar using remote software like TeamViewer I guess).\n\nThe pVMs do not use virtual disk images/files, they directly access a physical drive or partition like a physical machine does. There is no ability to take a snapshot of the system state or pause/resume like traditional VMs offer due to the direct hardware access instead of virtualized hardware. They can only suspend or hibernate like a physical machine besides shutting down.\n\nDoes this not sound like multiple physical machines more than traditional virtual machines? Would that permit retail licenses for instances that use Windows OS with the guest(if you'd call it that?).\n\nAlthough some instances would be static configurations, we might want to change the hardware layout/assignment for an instance(s) during certain projects. For example, 5 or so pVMs could be running at one time for individual users, with hardware mostly divided evenly or biased to some workloads. We might need to do some heavy processing and make all or most of 256GB of RAM and 4-8 GPUs to an instance. If this instance was an existing pVM with a Windows license the change in hardware configuration I think would throw off Windows licensing from what I've read and it would not think the license is valid? It would be nice to have a bit of freedom for dynamic hardware changes like that, but wouldn't be an issue to purchase another license for special configurations/instances even though the other licenses wouldn't be actively in use at that point in time.",

            "selftext": "Hi all\n\nHoping some of you more knowledgable people can help me with this problem. It seems basic but I just can't get it figured out.\n\nThe situation is this: I have a headless Windows 10 computer that does one thing - run a program automatically when it starts up that continues indefinitely. I only want the computer to run during certain hours, so I'm trying to automate the starting/stopping of all of this.\n\nThe program does just fine getting back to what it should be doing after being put to sleep and then waking so I'm trying to schedule the computer to automatically sleep and wake.\n\nI created a 'wake.bat' file that's scheduled in Task Scheduler, set to 'run with highest privileges' and 'Wake computer to run this task.' It is just the line: `cmd.exe /c \"exit\"`\n\nIt works just fine when it runs as scheduled after I put the computer to sleep by going through Start > Power > Sleep. The issue is it doesn't work after I put my computer to sleep with my sleep.bat file.\n\nThe sleep.bat file started as: `rundll32.exe powrprof.dll,SetSuspendState 0,1,0`\n\nWhen this didn't work I installed PsTools and changed it to: `PsShutdown -d -t 2`\n\nThis works sometimes?! When I put the computer to sleep myself the script to wake the computer executes and wakes the computer exactly at the scheduled time. When I put the computer to sleep with my PsShutdown script then sometimes the computer will wake up a minute or two late, or just not wake at all.\n\nI've made sure HPET is enabled in BIOS and set to 64 bit (I assume this is the correct setting since I'm running 64-bit Windows 10?).\n\nI've made sure the Advanced Power Settings -> Sleep is set to 'Allow Wake Timers'.\n\nI'm all out of ideas. Please give me any insight you have.",

            "selftext": "For some reason there was a large request for a script I wrote for terminated users. Original Topic here: https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/737z79/how_do_you_handle_your_o365_offboarding/\n\nI figured I would create a new thread so I can highlight everything all out.  There's two scripts actually, but the one I'm posting now does the first part of our process.  This may not work for you, everyone's process is different. However, what we do is, ticket gets submitted to HR, we run the script which does a bulk of things, ticket gets updated, calendar reminder sent out and thats the end of it (keeping in mind email forward is setup, etc).  90 days comes around and by this time the manager has had enough of the forwards and hes gotten mostly what he needs. We then process another extent of the termination.  I run the 90day post cleanup script which moves the user to a nonsyncing OU (365), and creates the 365 search for PST exportation and fires off an email to our team that I ran it with the details.  We then download the pst and the terminated has been fully committed.  Once that AD user is in a non-syncing OU, 365 treats it as such and moves that user to deleted users in the cloud where its kept for I think 30 days.\n\nPlease keep in mind this is GUI based. At the time I thought it would be cool. lol\n\nHere is what this does;  \n**AD stuff first**  \n* Disables the user (if you check it off)  \n* Loops through membership and removes from all groups (besides domain users!)  \n* Adds a no GFI group to the user (this can be removed for you or changed to your liking)  \n* Sets some attributes title to todays date (manager, company and department get nulled out)  \n* Resets/Sets the users password (this can be changed)  \n* Moves the account to a temporary Disabled Users OU (still syncs with 365) so we can keep their shared mailbox, account, etc  for 90 days until post cleanup  \n* Hides the user from the GAL  \n  \n**365 stuff**  \n* Removes the user license  \n* Converts the user to a shared mailbox (so we can still access it)  \n* Sets up the forward (if you typed in an email address)  \n* Fires off the outlook process, composes the calendar reminder with all variables you entered.  \n* We use webhelpdesk, then it fires off email to webhelpdesk with all information to add to ticket. You dont have to do anything!!  \n  \n\nPlease keep in mind, theres no doubt you'll have to alter this a bit to fit your process, but at least the bulk of the code is here and works great.  There is no error checking, so if for example you put in your wrong ad credentials up front, you will get alot of red errors. Also to note; theres a bunch of variables that you need to change like DOMAIN and COMPANYNAME, your AD OU's, etc. Opening it in Ultraedit works best to find these.  \n\n  \n*Any questions, I'll do my best to help.*  \n**Screenshots**   \nhttps://imgur.com/a/EGuQA  \n**Script**  \nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/h3j93dl9y5s0g43/TerminatedUserV1.3.ps1?dl=0\n  \nThere is the 90day post cleanup script which I can share as well if wanted\n\nUPDATE: Didnt think I'd get this kind of response. Wow. I'll get the 90 day posted tomorrow!  \n --------------------------------------------------- \n\n  \n  \n** **EDIT**  **  \nHere is a link below to the 90day post cleanup. Plz change all references of *\"yourdomain\"* to your fqdn.com please.  Change the word *\"DOMAIN\"* to your internal domain.  \n\n**What does this do?**  \n* When your outlook calendar reminder goes off after 90 days you run this script in powershell  \n* This script is none GUI based, only command prompt based  \n* First enter in your Domain Admin IT credentials  \n* Then afterwards it'll ask you for your office 365 global admin credentials.  Remember to use FQDN!  \n* Then it'll ask you for the username of the terminated user. Enter in just their username  **(example: first initial, lastname)**  \n* It'll ask you to confirm one last time, then it'll do the work!  \n* First it'll move the user from Disabled Users to \"To Be Deleted\" or whatever your OU is. This is a non-syncing OU with 365. Dont forget to set this in your Azure sync tool!  \n* Here is what my OU looks like:  https://imgur.com/a/7wgEv  \n* It will create the ediscovery search, where you can download the pst.    \n* Then it will fire off an email.  Post cleanup is now complete.  \n\n**Remember**, Once this script runs, the user goes to a whole another OU which doesnt sync wtih 365.  This essentially removes the user from the cloud and puts them in that microsoft 30day deleted container. You can still restore the user for 30 days, but for the sake of the cleanup, they are gone. This shouldnt matter though because the manager has had 90 days to get their emails, etc etc, and you now have a PST, so all bells and whistles should be covered\n\n**Script**  \nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/fn4qfoaf3pdqgyj/90daycleanup.ps1?dl=0",
