            "selftext": "I'm really curious about using MR. I didn't really jump on the hype train until I saw that hour plus talk by the Microsoft dude. I mean yes queue the second life jokes and w/e but I was really interested in running 2D apps in large screen spaces. \n\nI currently work with two 1080p monitors. I was thinking of going to the Samsung HMD since that's roughly the same number of pixels (not that I've calc'd it or anything) to my current setup. But the cool thing is from what I can tell you can scale things dynamically, to like 300\" AFAIK from the presentation. I realize the PPI decreases but the extra vertical res doesn't seem bad to me. \n\nI mostly do web dev, basic data science and some electronics stuff. \n\nFor the most part I could use web variants of everything to run my programs. Like using the SageMath VM either through CoCalc or a local VM instance. That covers python, jupyter and any math calcs I wanna do. \n\nIf I did small scale HDL work I could get away with using edaplayground though that is no where near my ideal way of workiing, or iverilog.com. \n\nI was under the assumption that you can use any ol 2D app like Sublime text or R Studio in MR space, but that doesn't seem the case. I realize there is the Bridge option to repackage existing Win32 apps, but that's if I have the source code. Obviously, I only have binaries for most programs so that's really not an ideal solution.\n\n\nI realized I can just RDP with the windows UWP app that exists to a localhost VirtualBox VM, so I can use my Vagrant or individual dev boxes if needed. That's what I thought of today but haven't had time to try it in the MR Simulator. \n\nAlso the MR simulator is a pain in the neck to run with keyboard and mouse. I realize it is far from the ideal option but I'm just evaluating it to see if sinking $500 is justified. Another reason why I'm asking this question because it's so time consuming to test out these ideas in the simulator since I don't have a gamepad. \n\n\nHas anyone had any experience with the MR dev kits from MS? Did you guys try out development, either through an IDE or some UWP app? Was it a pretty good experience? Could you migrate your workflow from the regular windows space to MR? Was the transition a problem or relatively seamless? \n\nHave you had any success with using RDP in MR to run Linux in mixed reality? \n\nFinally, would you recommend it to other developers? \n\nI don't mind strapping some giant ass goggle to my head for hours, if it's a nice use of productivity it wouldn't really be a problem. \n\nBut that's the case, IF is the big question.

            "selftext": "So I constructed a symbol table for my compiler and noticed that doing searches from the symbol table doesn't really seem to make searching faster nor easier.\n\nThe reason is that the symbol table has been constructed in the same order as how the program is read during semantic analysis phase. From top to bottom, line by line. Now, if I need to search for e.g. some return type from somewhere in the program, then searching from the symbol table is about the same complexity as searching by going through the program again, because the objects are ordered in the same exact way.\n\nOr does it make substantial difference that e.g. the symbol table is a list of lists, whereas my program is in the for of an AST. So that traversing a list of lists is more efficient than traversing an AST?\n\nOr should I perhaps use symbol tables in a stack like manner? That they're scope-specific, e.g. class-specific, so that one construct a symbol table only e.g. per class. And when one leaves the class, then one ditches the symbol table?\n\nWhy do I need a symbol table?\n\n---\n\nEdit: this is perhaps an okay presentation: http://labouseur.com/courses/compilers/AST-and-Symbol-Table.pdf",

            "selftext": "I'm really curious about using MR. I didn't really jump on the hype train until I saw that hour plus talk by the Microsoft dude. I mean yes queue the second life jokes and w/e but I was really interested in running 2D apps in large screen spaces. \n\nI currently work with two 1080p monitors. I was thinking of going to the Samsung HMD since that's roughly the same number of pixels (not that I've calc'd it or anything) to my current setup. But the cool thing is from what I can tell you can scale things dynamically, to like 300\" AFAIK from the presentation. I realize the PPI decreases but the extra vertical res doesn't seem bad to me. \n\nI mostly do web dev, basic data science and some electronics stuff. \n\nFor the most part I could use web variants of everything to run my programs. Like using the SageMath VM either through CoCalc or a local VM instance. That covers python, jupyter and any math calcs I wanna do. \n\nIf I did small scale HDL work I could get away with using edaplayground though that is no where near my ideal way of workiing, or iverilog.com. \n\nI was under the assumption that you can use any ol 2D app like Sublime text or R Studio in MR space, but that doesn't seem the case. I realize there is the Bridge option to repackage existing Win32 apps, but that's if I have the source code. Obviously, I only have binaries for most programs so that's really not an ideal solution.\n\n\nI realized I can just RDP with the windows UWP app that exists to a localhost VirtualBox VM, so I can use my Vagrant or individual dev boxes if needed. That's what I thought of today but haven't had time to try it in the MR Simulator. \n\nAlso the MR simulator is a pain in the neck to run with keyboard and mouse. I realize it is far from the ideal option but I'm just evaluating it to see if sinking $500 is justified. Another reason why I'm asking this question because it's so time consuming to test out these ideas in the simulator since I don't have a gamepad. \n\n\nHas anyone had any experience with the MR dev kits from MS? Did you guys try out development, either through an IDE or some UWP app? Was it a pretty good experience? Could you migrate your workflow from the regular windows space to MR? Was the transition a problem or relatively seamless? \n\nHave you had any success with using RDP in MR to run Linux in mixed reality? \n\nFinally, would you recommend it to other developers? \n\nI don't mind strapping some giant ass goggle to my head for hours, if it's a nice use of productivity it wouldn't really be a problem. \n\nBut that's the case, IF is the big question.
