Feedback is appreciated.\n\nGithub: [https://github.com/ferreiradaselva/mathc](https://github.com/ferreiradaselva/mathc)\n\nEDIT 2:\n\nThanks for the feedback, yall!\n\nChanges that I will make from the feedback:\n\n1. Make version of each function that take pointers. I will add a `p` prefix to those functions. The ones that take the structs as values will remain, tho.\n\n2. Add support to anonymous unions (C11 specific, so probably will be separated by #ifdef/endif)\n\nEDIT 1:\n\nI got 3 good feedback from a forum, that I would like to share (and maybe it could be useful for your own libs):\n\n1. Make the function names more explicit. Probably adding some prepositions would help.\n\n2. Maybe explicit tell padding of the structs. This could be useful to use the structs as arrays, for example:\n\n    cmatrix m = matrix_identity();\n    \n    float *v = &m;\n    \n    /* Now you can edit as if it was an array: */\n    \n    v[1] = 1.0f\n    \n    /* Or you can pass to an OpenGL without the need to convert to an array */\n    \n    glUniform4fv(view_loc, 16, v);\n\n3.

I know i could have done it in C but i am fluent in Java so i just smashed it out. \n\nNow currently, i pass data from the Java service to the C program through a file (Horrible and inefficient i know) which seems to be an awkward but functional way of doing so.\n\nIs there any other way i can do this?\n\nThanks",

On my GNU/Linux system it will not. This is probably due to the different version of GCC installed on both machines.\n\nTwo questions: \n\n-First, what does \"if (out&1)\" mean?\n\n-how to get the program to display the pi digits on my Fedora system?\n\nThanks\n",

            "selftext": "I'm trying to write a program that has similar functionality to the Unix command 'ls'.  However, I've run into what I can only think is undefined behavior when I try to run the print function.  Sometimes the program runs perfecting and other times it doesn't depending on the window size and which directory is being printed.\n\nHere is a link to the specific function that I think may be causing the problem: [print_entries](https://pastebin.com/Xd7cLK2C)\n\nThe problem where the program gets stuck is in the for loop that pads each printed directory entry with spaces so that the next column is in line.  I'm pretty sure that there is some undefined behavior going on.  My best guess is that I might have messed up some kind of operator precedence.\n\nWhen I run the program, half of the directory entries get printed and then it gets stuck in the for loop.  However, when I delete the backslash character in the last statement in the program to make it print the character 'n' instead of a new line character, nothing is printed at all.  The only other explanation I can think of is that printing the new line character empties the kernel buffer to the terminal.\n\nI'm completely lost as to what the problem is or how to go about finding this problem.  If anyone could help, I would appreciate it.  Thanks.\n\nEdit:  I figured out some more information.  I decided to print out the information of some values while in the infinite loops.  It turns out that this value becomes -1 at some point: col_width[current_col]) - (strlen(dirbuf[row*current_col+current_row])+2) + additional_spaces\n\nI must have made a mistake.  Even so, that means that the conditional starts out at 0<-1.  The for loops should never execute.\n\nEdit 2:  I figured out the main problem.  I was trying to calculate the number of rows that ls printed by using the number of directory entries that were to be printed and the number of columns that were to be printed.  The expression I used was rows = ceil((double)num_entries / columns).  However, there were some cases where this doesn't work.  An example would be when there are 160 entries and 9 columns.  ceil(160/9) = 18, but the function that determined the column widths calculated this using 19 rows, so it was off by one.  This off by one error caused certain strings in columns that were too narrow, which caused the infinite loop.  It is now working as intended.  https://i.imgur.com/lSiyh2v.png  Should I still do something about having the unsigned strlen value in the conditional?",

            "selftext": "I'm currently working on a hash table implementation in C. I'm trying to implement dynamic resizing, but came across a problem.\n\nIf resizing a hash table means creating a new one with double (or half) the size, rehashing, and deleting the old one, how can I deal with old references the user may have made to the old table? Example code (I've omitted error checking just for this example):\n\n    int main(int argc, char *argv[])\n    {\n        ht = ht_create(5) /* make hashtable with size 5 */\n        ht_insert(\"john\", \"employee\"); /* key-val pair \"john -> employee\" */\n        ht_insert(\"alice\", \"employee\");\n        char *position = ht_get(ht, \"alice\"); /* get alice's position from hashtable ht */\n\n\n        ht_insert(\"bob\", \"boss\"); /* this insert exceeds the load factor, resizes the hash table */\n\n        printf(\"%s\", position); /* returns NULL because the previous hashtable that was resized was freed */\n\n        return 0;\n    }\n\n\nIn this case `position` pointed to `alice`'s value which was found in the hashtable. When it was resized, we freed the hash table and lost it. How can I fix this problem, so the user won't have to worry that a previously defined pointer was freed?\n\nEDIT: my current hash table implementation\n\nhash.c\n\n    #include <stdio.h>\n    #include <stdlib.h>\n    #include <string.h>\n    \n    #include \"hash.h\"\n    \n    #define LOADFACTOR 0.75\n    \n    typedef struct tableentry /* hashtab entry */\n    {\n        struct tableentry *next;\n        char *key;\n        void *val;\n    } tableentry_t;\n    \n    typedef struct hashtable\n    {\n        datatype_t type;\n        size_t size;\n        size_t load;

            "selftext": "As I was writing my C game engine, I decided to decouple the math implementation and make its own library.\n\nIt has implementation for 2D vectors, 3D vectors, 4D vectors, quaternions, matrices and easing functions.\n\nIt's mainly for game programming. Feedback is appreciated.\n\nGithub: [https://github.com/ferreiradaselva/mathc](https://github.com/ferreiradaselva/mathc)\n\nEDIT 2:\n\nThanks for the feedback, yall!\n\nChanges that I will make from the feedback:\n\n1. Make version of each function that take pointers. I will add a `p` prefix to those functions. The ones that take the structs as values will remain, tho.\n\n2. Add support to anonymous unions (C11 specific, so probably will be separated by #ifdef/endif)\n\nEDIT 1:\n\nI got 3 good feedback from a forum, that I would like to share (and maybe it could be useful for your own libs):\n\n1. Make the function names more explicit. Probably adding some prepositions would help.\n\n2. Maybe explicit tell padding of the structs. This could be useful to use the structs as arrays, for example:\n\n    cmatrix m = matrix_identity();\n    \n    float *v = &m;\n    \n    /* Now you can edit as if it was an array: */\n    \n    v[1] = 1.0f\n    \n    /* Or you can pass to an OpenGL without the need to convert to an array */\n    \n    glUniform4fv(view_loc, 16, v);\n\n3. Add tests. Which is what I'm currently doing.",
