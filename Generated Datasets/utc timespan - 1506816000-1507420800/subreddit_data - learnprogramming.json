I'm primarily hardware/networking at the moment, looking after several systems in a large college and have been doing similar since i branched into IT. \n\nI'd like to switch it up and learn dev, i've been told Android is probably the best if i'm going to commit and learn as this can be the most rewarding?\n\nI'd like to know, from people that have already jumped ship / changed careers how you went about this. I'm not adverse to paying for sites such as Lynda, Udacity etc. I can devote plenty of time and commitment to this endeavour, i'd just like some advice on where to start! \n\nI've done basic programming in University, but i would definately need to brush up, the concepts are there though. \n\nThank you for reading my wall of text <3",

I found the APIs within javax.print somewhat helpful, but then I run into the issue of supported file types.\n\nIn my specific project, I plan on using something like iText to create a PDF file, which I wan't to later print. (iText doesn't support printing directly). Any resources I find online are incomplete or 10 years old and no longer relevant it seems. It's really frustrating actually. \n\nMost printers don't support printing PDF files directly, so I need a way around this limitation. Obviously someone knows how to do it, as plenty of Java applications print plenty of PDFs and other files all the time. \n\nI found a couple paid libraries that seem to promise easier PDF printing, but are really NO good free libraries to make this any easier? Searching for how to print a file to a printer in Java is like embarking on some quest to discover ancient knowledge from the tomes of the elders. It shouldn't be this difficult.\n\nSome solutions suggest using acrobat from the command line, but that would tie me to only machines which have it installed.\n\nThere HAS to be a better, simpler solution to printing stuff in Java. I refuse to believe that this is the best we can do in 2017. Can someone give me guidance or point me toward some tutorials that aren't written like they come straight from Bangalore in the year 2002? Is there a library I can use to abstract all of this away? Something that would handle the UI elements would be nice too, but if that isn't out there I'll settle for having to build my own UI print dialog. I'm a 4.0 engineering student and figuring out a clean and simple way to print a PDF feels like tensor calculus.",

So I REALLY hope someone can help alleviate this confusion for me.\n\nSo I have this equation here I am trying to apply to the MNIST data set, which has 10 classes. Each of the 10 classes has 784 pixels (28*28 image)\n\nEquation:: https://imgur.com/a/PLy9e\n\nb is an array of bias terms for each class. So there will be 10 b's in a b array.\n\nSo b looks like this (only 1 b array):\n\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n\nW is a matrix of weight terms for each class. \n\nSo W looks like this **784 times!**: \n\n[ -4.30113018e-01  -1.75455093e+00   6.65812373e-01   2.03360930e-01\n    1.04078758e+00  -9.83156502e-01   1.56778967e+00  -1.40801275e+00\n   -3.29478174e-01  -1.40257847e+00]\n\n\nSo what I am trying desperately to wrap my head around is how to actually properly multiply/matrix multiply / whatever these W (weights) with their b (bias) terms.\n\n\nLike I don't get how matrix multiplication works here. Especially in the context of this equation. And 95% of what I multiply/matrix multiply does not work because of tensorflow taking in like a matrix of size [200, 784] or [1,10] because of the images and their weights. I am honestly 100% stuck here at this part of the equation and have utterly no idea how to move forward.\n\nWe have W transpose multiplied by b. But that doesn't really make sense to me, because this equation looks like it should produce a scalar. And we add this scalar to b.\n\n\n\nSome code to help\n\n    W = tf.Variable(tf.random_normal([IMAGE_SIZE, NUMBER_OF_CLASSES]), name=\"Weights\")\n    b = tf.Variable(tf.random_normal([1, NUMBER_OF_CLASSES]), name=\"Biases\")\n\n\n    matrixMultiplication= tf.matmul(tf.transpose(W), X)\n    addBiasTerm= tf.add(matrixMultiplication, b)\n\n\nAnd then the add bias term gives me this error:\n\n    ValueError: Dimensions must be equal, but are 784 and 10 for 'Add' (op: 'Add') with input shapes: [10,784], [1,10].",

My issue is that when I go to change plans it tells me to please add a card before choosing a plan. The code for the page is as follows:\n\nThe form:\n\n    `<form {% if !user.stripe.last4 %}id=\"cardForm\"{% endif %} \n    action=\"/user/plan\" method=\"POST\" class=\"form-horizontal\">\n      <div class=\"form-group\">\n        <label for=\"plan\" class=\"col-sm-3 control-label\">Plan</label>\n        <div class=\"col-sm-4\">\n          {% for plan in plans %}\n            <div class=\"radio\">\n              <label>\n                <input type=\"radio\" {% if user.stripe.plan == loop.key \n    %}checked{% endif %} name=\"plan\" value=\"{{loop.key}}\" data-toggle=\"radio\">\n                <span>{{plan.name}} - ${{plan.price}}</span>\n              </label>\n            </div>\n          {% endfor %}\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      {% if !user.stripe.last4 %}\n      <div id=\"cardWrapper\">\n        <div class=\"form-group\">\n          <label class=\"col-sm-3 control-label\">Test Card Info</label>\n          <div class=\"col-sm-7\">\n            <div class=\"form-control-static\">4242424242424242, 11/19, 123 - <a \n    href=\"https://stripe.com/docs/testing\">additional test info</a></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"form-group\">\n          <label class=\"col-sm-3 control-label\">Card Number</label>\n          <div class=\"col-sm-4\">\n            <input id=\"card-num\" type=\"text\" class=\"form-control\">\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"form-group\">\n          <label class=\"col-sm-3 control-label\">Card Details</label>\n          <div class=\"col-sm-4\">\n            <div class=\"row\">\n              <div class=\"col-xs-4\">\n                <input id=\"card-month\" type=\"text\" size=\"2\" maxlength=\"2\" \n    class=\"form-control\" placeholder=\"MM\">\n              </div>\n              <div class=\"col-xs-4\">\n                <input id=\"card-year\"  type=\"text\" size=\"2\" maxlength=\"2\" \n    class=\"form-control\" placeholder=\"YY\">\n              </div>\n              <div class=\"col-xs-4\">\n                <input id=\"card-cvc\" type=\"text\" size=\"3\" maxlength=\"3\" \n    class=\"form-control\" placeholder=\"CVC\">\n              </div>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"form-group\">\n          <div class=\"col-sm-6\">\n            <div id=\"cardFormError\" class=\"alert alert-danger hidden\" \n    role=\"alert\">\n              <p>{{error}}</p>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      {% endif %}\n      <div class=\"form-group\">\n        <div class=\"col-sm-offset-3 col-sm-4\">\n          <button type=\"submit\" class=\"btn btn-primary\">Update Plan</button>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </form>`\nCalls the route /user/plan\n\n    app.post('/user/plan',\n        setRedirect({auth: '/', success: '/billing', failure: '/billing'}),\n        isAuthenticated,\n        users.postPlan);\nusers.postPlan is the issue I think:\n\n    exports.postPlan = function(req, res, next){\n      var plan = req.body.plan;\n      var stripeToken = null;\n    \n      if(plan){\n        plan = plan.toLowerCase();\n      }\n    \n      if(req.user.stripe.plan == plan){\n        req.flash('info', {msg: 'The selected plan is the same as the current plan.'});\n        return res.redirect(req.redirect.success);\n      }\n    \n      if(req.body.stripeToken){\n        stripeToken = req.body.stripeToken;\n      }\n    \n      if(!req.user.stripe.last4 && !req.body.stripeToken){\n        req.flash('errors', {msg: 'Please add a card to your account before choosing a plan.'});\n        return res.redirect(req.redirect.failure);\n      }\n    \n      User.findById(req.user.id, function(err, user) {\n        if (err) return next(err);\n    \n        user.setPlan(plan, stripeToken, function (err) {\n          var msg;\n    \n          if (err) {\n            if(err.code && err.code == 'card_declined'){\n              msg = 'Your card was declined. Please provide a valid card.';\n            } else if(err && err.message) {\n              msg = err.message;\n            } else {\n              msg = 'An unexpected error occurred.';\n            }\n    \n            req.flash('errors', { msg:  msg});\n            return res.redirect(req.redirect.failure);\n          }\n          req.flash('success', { msg: 'Plan has been updated.' });\n          res.redirect(req.redirect.success);\n        });\n      });\n    };\nThis is the code I think that somewhere is messed up. If there appear to be more I can include let me know. I am not sure which section of code the issue lays in but I think it is the users.postPlan but I don't know enough about node to tell.\n\nThis is the block that seems to be an issue but I know it has to relate to somewhere else too, right?\n\n     if(!req.user.stripe.last4 && !req.body.stripeToken){\n        req.flash('errors', {msg: 'Please add a card to your account before choosing a plan.'});\n        return res.redirect(req.redirect.failure);\n      }",

One of the companies has provided a programming problem to solve to get a direct interview, I can tackle this problem on paper and theoretically I think I know what I'm supposed to do programming-wise but when I get to implementation stage I'm just blank.\n\nSo the challenge basically involves drawing data from a txt file that holds results of 2 players removing coloured tokens from a bag. Each token has a colour ( red, green, blue or yellow) and either a number or letter (A-C) (1-9). The colour and value of the token has a bearing on which player wins. \n\n1. The player with the lowest single letter in alphabetical order wins (No letter < C < B < A, multiple letters are ignored)\n\n2. The player whose sum of their numeric tokens is closest to 8 wins (e.g. 7 beats 10, 10 beats 5, 6 and 10 are equal).\n\n3. The player with the single highest scoring token wins (1 < .. < 9 < C < B < A. On a tie, yellow < green < blue < red. e.g. blue \n    9 < blue C, red 4 < yellow 5, yellow A < green A).\n\nThe data for use has been submitted in the following format:\n\nbA,r6**:**r4,yC,rC\n\nrB,b6**:**yA,r7\n\ng5,gC,rC**:**g9,yB,g3\n\ng9,r5**:**rA,y8,b6\n\nb8**:**g4,b1,gA\n\ng8**:**r2\n\nrB,rA,bB**:**g5,bA\n\nThe colon separating p1 and p2s results.\n\nIf player 1 wins the result is 0 and if player 2 wins the result is one and each 8 results provides the binary for an ASCII character. Even on paper the results I'm getting are incorrect actually. If anyone has any ideas on how I can implement this in python this would be a great help. I assumed I would just collect the data for each player in separate arrays for p1 and p2 and then compare them using while, if , if-else statements.",

As a fictional example, let's say I write customized songs for special occasions. The user writes a bit of information for me, like the name of the birthday boy, and anecdotes they would like to have incorporated into the song. Let's say this service costs 10$. When they send the request to me, the 10$ are then not immidiatly billed. When I review their request I can choose to decline it, and the 10$ are not billed at all, or I can accept the request and then the money gets transfered.\nAn important feature to this system is the ability for the user to set a deadline for me to reply on their request, so they know that after, let's say 48 hours, they won't be able to get billed the 10$ any longer, and their request is no longer acceptable \n\nI hope this makes sense, and you can help me out how to go about this",

Worked my way through FreeCodeCamp and The Odin Project, so I've got a good understanding of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Ruby on Rails. I also picked up an unpaid internship working as a junior front end dev for the past 2 months. \n\nNow: I've been applying to any and all web development jobs, in hopes of landing an interview and showing employers that I have the will to learn. I just got off the phone with a potential employer...very excited! The employer asked me some basic questions regarding the languages I know, and also told me that their company is looking for a junior full stack engineer and relies heavily on PHP lamp stack(?)/mySQL/Javascript/jQuery/Magento eCommerce platform. I was honest with them about how much I know and told them that given the opportunity I am willing to put in 10000% effort. They told me to brush up on my PHP, mySQL, and Javascript and come in for an interview early next week. \n \nWhat I'm looking for: HTML, CSS, and Ruby are my strongest points. However, that doesn't help me much for this job. I need a crash course in the aforementioned languages/topics. I don't want to waste hours on an imperfect resource, can anyone point me in the best direction?\n\nI am forever grateful for any responses that help, thank you reddit! \n\nTLDR: newb, got an interview next week, plan to study all weekend, need a crash course in PHP lamp stack(?)/mySQL/Javascript(jQuery)/Magento eCommerce platform.

            "selftext": "Hey /r/learnprogramming!\n\nI'm a web developer currently going back and learning C++ to get a better understanding of lower level languages. I figured I would do this by trying to remake some games. I have made a crude version of Pong which functions somewhat and want to start getting into refactoring now. The issue I'm running into is I'm not too sure on the relationships my classes should have.\n\nCurrently I have the following classes:\n\n- Game (has graphics and window)\n- Player\n- Enemy\n- Ball\n\nThe `main()` runs the game loop and controls the framerate.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nI know this is bad and most of my variables should be private, but I coded this way so I could learn from code I wrote and have solutions that I can relate to personally. I tried coding everything OOP in tutorials and found myself learning nothing. \n\nMy thoughts on how stuff should be broken up and related:\n\nGame:\n```\n(private)\n- Enemy\n- Player\n- Ball\n- ScoreRect ? (SDL_Rect)\n- SDL_Window\n- SDL_Renderer\n- isRunning \n```\n\nPlayer:\n```\n(private)\n- PlayerRect ? (SDL_Rect) \n- _height, _width, _x, _y, _yVel, _score; \n```\n\nEnemy\n```\n(private)\n- EnemyRect ? (SDL_Rect)\n- _height, _width, _x, _y, _yVel, _score; \n```\n\nBall\n```\n(private)\n- BallRect ? (SDL_Rect) \n- _height, _width, _x, _y, _xVel, _yVel\n```\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nI guess  the specific questions I have are:\n\n1. Should these be located on the class that has the other data (ie. Ball class has ballRect) or should they be located where the graphics will be used (ie. Game class).\n\n2. Is the overall skeleton of classes I have alright? Should I have another for Graphics and another for Events?\n\n3. I'm not understanding why I have to  define a SDL_Window in a class as a pointer. But, if I declare it inline with the code outside of the class, it can be a regular value variable.\n\n------\n\nAny and all input is welcome. I don't mind being torn apart, that is how you learn.

I made a simple string \"\"Books are boring\". I tried to remove the \"are\". Since I couldnt do that, I tried adding a \"Many\" in the beginning, but didn't work either. What am I doing wrong? Do I have to add each individual word in the string in order delete and add them? \n\nThis isn't all of what I have done.

Raises a bunch of questions without ever providing an answer ( on purpose so that according to him we become \"self-learners\").\n\nOne of the questions was Data Type vs Data Structure.\n\nI understand that an \"int\" or \"double\" is a data-type, while an \"array\" is both a data type and a data structure.\n\nInt/Double etc have a pre-defined behavior. When an Array of Ints is a Data Structure because an array can have a bunch of different data types. \n\nDo I have that right so far? This is where things start to get murky for me.\n\nIs an array also a \"data type\" because it has a pre-defined behavior? Like we can access its elements via array[i] and we can call its functions like .length() etc? what I mean is that having a predefined behavior is a characteristic of a data type. So that makes it a data type, but then also other data types can be implemented via an array, which would make it a data structure?\n\nIs that right?\n\nBut if have an parentArray of intArrays, then intArrays is a data type but parentArray is a data structure? Or am I misunderstanding?\n\nBasically a data structure is a container, and this container can be a variety of different implementations, and data type are the actual things stored in the container? If we have a 3 dimmensional array, then 2nd level array is both a data type for 1st level array and a (data structure for 3rd level array)? \n\nIn class we are discussing, Queues, Priority Queues, Sets, Maps, Stacks. He refers to them ass \"Data Types\" and NOT structures. Is this because all of these are just names for objects with specific behavior? But if we have a queue implemented as an array then the array is the data structure and queue is the data type? In this case is it the data type of whats inside the array (like each cell is of that data type), or do we say that the whole array is now of data type queue?\n\nSorry for a long post, but my head is swimming as I am trying to tackle this.\n\nThanks very much!",

I don't even touch the `prev` reference if I'm trying to insert a node before the first node due to my conditional check on line 13.\n\nis there some sort of issue/obscure edge case that I'm not seeing here?

Also, if I'm not implementing a web api, does anyone really care? Do non-standard urls look unprofessional, hurt my search ranking, or otherwise do damage to me?",

I've read up on std::thread, and I feel like I have a basic understanding of the concept of thread-safety. I modified [a very simple benchmarking program](https://github.com/superelitist/OnlineEventsRedux/blob/master/Benchmarking/Benchmarking.cpp) I'm using to create two threads that run two similar algorithms simultaneously. So far, so good.\n\nBut in my actual program, I need a worker thread to generate data and write it to a std::vector. I am told that reading from a std::vector while another thread writes to it is not thread-safe (which I assume means it'll probably crash :p).\n\nNow, I can easily cause a crash by having any two threads write to the vector concurrently. I've observed this. Yet, if I slightly modify my benchmarking program to tell the main thread to **read** from the vector in a loop while another thread **writes** to it, I have no problems.\n\nWhy would everybody on the Internet say that writing from one thread while reading from another is unsafe? Am I just getting lucky?\n\nWhile I'm at it, another related question: I have an I7-4790k (8 logical cores). When I run the benchmarking program, either with threads or without, I see utilization spread more or less evenly across all the cores. I guess that's understandable, if the CPU scheduler knows it can spread a bunch of math operations across many cores, but I didn't think it did this by itself?!",

            "selftext": "Hello /r/learnprogramming, so I want to learn more about network programming, and therefore I am now planning to make a system that works like follows: \n\n* There is a server that keeps track of all currently connected clients, storing their IP addresses. For example by pinging them all on a set interval.\n\n* When one of the clients prompts it, they are connected/paired with another IP chosen at random. From now on they should have a direct connection to each other on which they can send messages to one another.\n\n* The server will also keep track of which clients are \"busy\" conversing with another, so they cannot be chosen for a pairing.\n\n**Anyways, here are my questions:**\n\n1. What would you call a server like that. If I were to rent one, what do I search for? I do have experience with writing back-ends for websites, but this is not a web service. At first I looked into dedicated servers, but I don't see the need for having a whole machine for this one service as it's quite lightweight.\n\n2. When a client has received its peer's IP, what steps needs to be taken in order to establish a connection, I have done this at several occasions over a LAN, but when doing so over the internet I understand that you'll somehow need to bypass the firewalls on each end. \n\n3. What are the most exposed potential security holes to be considered in such a system?\n\nAs for the client side I am planning on using Unity and primarily run on Android and iOS, as for the server side language/framework I am open to suggestions. My background is desktop software development using C++, Rust, Python and occasionally other languages. My day-to-day OS is Manjaro Linux, but I do have a Windows desktop as well.

My first project is very simple minded with the output asking for the persons age, and after they have inputed their har the text \"So you are X years old, yes/no?\" refering back to what they wrote. I really dont know if this is possible or not (I have been looking online for almost half a day), but I want to know if there is some way to make it so if people answer \"yes\" on the question, they can continue the program as normal. But if they answer \"no\" they return to the original question about how old they are and start from the beginning. If possible I would like to make it so the program would loop itself back until they get their age right and write \"yes\". \n\nEDIT: Using c++ on xCode with a macbook air. \n\nThanks in advance!",

But I have no foreseeable career future except in the field of music..I would like to be able to do something else. \n\nIt seems the only things in life Im good at are playing music and pleasing my woman. lol.\n\nI have aspirations of having a family some day and I don't see music paying the bills or providing enough value to live comfortably. \n\nMusic had started off as a slight interest for me. But I remember wanting to give up after learning only how to play smoke on the water and struggling hard. It was only through persevering and seeing the POTENTIAL of what I could become that I plodded along. \n\nI suspect that coding COULD be similar. I have a slight interest in it as of now. I took a few python exercises and was able to understand the concepts and run a few small (MARY HAD A LITTLE LAMB) programs. Make a turtle and Print something. \nWhich is probably akin to learning the names of the strings on a guitar haha.\n\nSo yes, initially, my primary motivation is MONEY.\n\nIf anyone has any ideas for me that may have been in similar circumstances I would be eternally grateful. \n\nMy main questions for someone that is just starting out with no earthly idea:\n\n1. Where do I start?\n2. How can I develop an interest?\n3. What free resources are the best?\n4. What language should I learn for the best hope of contributing to the marketplace?\n\nAlso, I am completely open to any insight you might have beyond answering my questions.\n\nThank you in advance for your responses!

I plan to do this later with a long nested IF statement.\n\n**The Code Itself**\n\n    function myFunction() {\n      var sheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSheet();\n      var start = sheet.getRange('b10').getValue(); //sets an initial \"high score\" of the value in cell b10\n      sheet.getRange('d14').setValue(start);\n  \n      var startRowOne = 10;  // where level one results live\n      var startRowTwo = 11;  // where level two results live  -- DON'T THINK I NEED THIS\n      var colCount = 8; // the number of columns it will have to cycle through\n      var count = 2;  // starts counting in column B\n  \n      var dataRange = sheet.getRange(startRowOne, 2, 2, colCount);  // the range of cells from b10 to h11 is where I want to work\n      var data = dataRange.getValues();\n      var current = data;\n  \n      // This loop is supposed to start in cell B10 and run across to H10, drop down one row and do the same thing\n      for (n in data[0])\n      {\n        sheet.getRange('d21').setValue(n);  // this just helps me check to see if the loop is iterating\n        sheet.getRange('d22').setValue(data[n]);\n    \n        if(current > start){  // if the current cell is greater than start\n          start = current;  // then change the value of start the the value of the current cell\n      sheet.getRange('d14').setValue(start);  // write that new value in cell d20\n      }\n    n++;  // increment the counting variable n\n       } \n        }\n\n",

So, for instance blacklisting certain sites or upvoting or downvoting results.\n\nSo Google custom search isn't really helpful in this regard.

            "selftext": "Apologies if this gets a bit long-winded, I'll try to be as descriptive as possible.\n\nFor my work in the film industry, one job I have is to create shot reports - basically, I go through trailers, note the timecode at every cut (change in shot), take a screenshot of every new shot, and align it all into an excel document. This is very tedious work, so I'm trying to write a script to expedite the process.\n\nIt may or may not be easier to code something like this outside of excel, but I'm trying to do it all in-program first. I have a bit of a programming background, so I know what I want to do and how I want to do it; the issue is figuring out the correct syntax and format to successfully implement it into Visual Basic.\n\nIn my first test, I took a trailer and cut it up in AVID at each shot change. I then took the EDL file and shaved it down so that I had a concise list of every new shot timecode. I wrote a quick autohotkey script to gather all of that info and put it into excel, so now I have a column with all of my timecodes.\n\nI downloaded a VLC plugin (Jump to Time [Previous Frame] v2.1), so that I have a way to input the timecode and go specifically to that spot. I understand that VLC has an ActiveX plugin that allows scripting access, but again, I'm not sure how really to access it.\n\nEssentially, what I need to do now is the following: Excel will take a timecode from the column, send and input that information into the VLC plugin, send a \"click\" so it will navigate to that point, send a \"Shift+S\" to save a screenshot of that frame, and then loop it to do the same thing with every timecode on the list. Ideally, then it would import each newly created image file into the column next to the timecodes, formatting the cells to fit the images (and obviously keeping the timecode associated with the correct corresponding image).\n\nI imagine it will take two separate scripts for the gathering of screenshots and the importing into the spreadsheet, and maybe only the latter can actually be in Visual Basic. I know this is a lot to cover, but I'm pretty lost and would appreciate any help anyone is willing to give me.\n\nThank you so much in advance...hopefully I can get this working eventually.",

At first I did `lengthList.add(list.size())` but this was wrong since it is just the size of the first element, so I get [4,4,4,4]. I can't think of a notation to get the size of each element, since each element is not an object, so I cannot call the .size() method on it. I tried to do `lengthList.add(list.get(word).size()` but this also doesn't work since `.get()` expects an integer inside of it I'm pretty sure. So the only way I think now is to use a while loop, since that way I may be able to use integers for accessing their index. But how do I do it using this for each way?",

So I decided to give a try to w3schools a few weeks ago and I liked it more. Yesterday, some good fellows on reddit suggested to try freeCodeCamp instead. And here I am, learning by doing and it is going great. \n\nWhat do you think about freeCodeCamp? Is it the best website to learn to code out there?

I suspect I need to join the table, but I have no idea what would be the best practice in this instance to create such a JSON object.\n\nAdditionally, I'm not sure how I would best add something to this.

Also, it's over verbose just to get to print stuff out, like system.out.println instead of like cout << \"\" or in python print(\"\"). \n\nAlso, all of the explanations in the program and any tutorials i've seen on classes, methods, functions, concatinations and all that kinda stuff are TERRIBLY unnintuitive to the layman (Me). like the HELL is a Method, or a container, or an Object, or an instance, or a class. they just dont make sense. im finding people having to try to explain them to me by saying like \"Well this is like a car, like THE car, and this, is like ... your car... and like this one is like, a particular model of car etc. all that is nonsense, you shouldn't have to explain things to people like that in something thats apparently much easier and user friendly that something else? \n\nMaybe it's just me, i'm actually finding C++ much easier to understand than Java. and Python is CERTAINLY easier to understand.

            "selftext": "Hi everyone! I need some help with my Java homework. I'll try my best to explain as clearly as possible.\nBasically, I have to create a program where I have to ask the user for a chain of RNA which are made of Nucleotides (A, G, C or U) and then display the total number of oxygen, carbon, hydrogen and Nitrogen. And then other stuff but that's stuff I'm gonna bother with later.\n\nFor example the user wants to search for the chain ACGUGC, then I'll have a total of 27 atoms of carbon, 29 atoms of Hydrogen, etc.\n\nAnyway, my teacher wants me to use at least one class that inherits from ArrayList where I'll have to create methods to calculate the total number of carbon, etc. Here's what I made:\n\npublic class Chain<T> extends ArrayList<T> and its constructor where I call super().\n\nI then made another class called Nucleotides, its constructor and the getters so I could make an ArrayList<Nucleotides> in my main. And by reading one character at a time it will make an instance of either the nucleotide A,G,C or U with its appropriate number of oxygen and other atoms and be put in the ArrayList with .add() .\n\nThen I wanted to create a method that will calculate the number of atoms in my Chain class and here's what I made:\n\npublic int sumHydrogen(){\n\n      int total;\n     \n      for (int i=0; i < size(); ++i){\n\n        total += get(i).getHydrogen();\n      }\n\n    return total;\n\n}\n\nbut I can't access .getHydrogen or any other getters from the Chain class. So I was wondering what I was doing wrong or how can I access an object class variable in an ArrayList or maybe if there's an alternative way I can do this.\n\nSorry if I'm not really clear enough. I'll try my best to answer any ambiguities.\n\nEDIT: I'd like to mention I tried to put everything in one class but still didn't work.\nI'm guessing total += get(i).getHydrogen(); isn't correct and I must be doing something wrong.\n\nAlso forgot to mention that I'm only allowed to used what I learned in class so I'm limited in what I can use. I'll be sure to mention if I'm allowed to use something or not.",

The final code that you receive at the end of this video is as follows:\n\n\n\n\nimport tkinter as tk\n\nLARGE_FONT = ('Verdana', 12)\n\n\nclass example_window(tk.Tk):\n\n\tdef __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):\n\t\n\t\ttk.Tk.__init__(self, *args, **kwargs)\t\n\t\tcontainer = tk.Frame(self)\n\n\t\tcontainer.pack(side='top', fill='both', expand=True)\n\t\t\n\t\tcontainer.grid_rowconfigure(0, weight=1)\n\t\tcontainer.grid_columnconfigure(0, weight=1)\n\t\t\n\t\tself.frames = { }\n\t\t\n\t\tfor F in (StartPage, PageOne):\n\t\t\n\t\t\tframe = F(container, self)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tself.frames[F] = frame\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tframe.grid(row=0, column=0, sticky='nsew')\n\t\t\n\t\tself.show_frame(StartPage)\n\t\t\n\tdef show_frame(self, controller):\n\t\t\n\t\tframe = self.frames[controller]\n\t\tframe.tkraise()\n\t\t\n\t\t\nclass StartPage(tk.Frame):\n\n\tdef __init__(self, parent, controller):\n\t\ttk.Frame.__init__(self, parent)\n\t\tlabel = tk.Label(self, text='Start Page', font=LARGE_FONT)\n\t\tlabel.pack(pady=10, padx=10)\n\t\t\n\t\tbutton1 = tk.Button(self, text='Visit Page 1', command=lambda: controller.show_frame(PageOne))\n\t\tbutton1.pack()\n\nclass PageOne(tk.Frame):\n\t\n\tdef __init__(self, parent, controller):\n\t\ttk.Frame.__init__(self, parent)\n\t\tlabel = tk.Label(self, text='Page 1', font=LARGE_FONT)\n\t\tlabel.pack(pady=10, padx=10)\n\t\t\n\t\tbutton1 = tk.Button(self, text='Back To Home', command=lambda: controller.show_frame(StartPage))\n\t\tbutton1.pack()\n\n\t\t\nprogram = example_window()\nprogram.mainloop()\n\nThis is very different from any other program I've written thus far. Normally, I have written programs that start with some set of class definitions, functions (either built-ins or custom), and a main function that serves somewhat as the control for the program. So I've been essentially trying to parse each line to be able to figure out what the program is doing at each stage. I'm going to put my questions in **bold** so hopefully the formatting on this doesn't look too wonky.\n\n*Imports the tkinter library and relabel it tk (I assume so we can make things more compact)*\n\n*Creates constant tuple with font information so that if you want to change the font, you can do so here rather than having to find our call in code.*\n\n\n*Defines a new class that inherits tk.Tk (basically, from what I can tell, including this inheritance means that when the new class is instantiated, it calls the Tk method from the tkinter library, which is just the method that creates a main window. The rest of the definition of the class will simply add features to the main window).*\n\n*Creates init, the method that gets called to create the object when the class is instantiated. We use self as an argument for clarity.* **I have no clue why he's including args and kwargs here. I can assume only one of three reasons: a) he knows that at some future point, we may need to send some optional arguments to this function, and he's planning ahead, b) this is a convention for classes in python, and when I've seen python code in the past that doesn't include it, it's because that other coder isn't familiar with these conventions, or c) He's already using them somehow, and I just am missing it.**\n\n*Initializes the inherited class Tk, which appears to also have the args/kwargs stuff in it for some reason. This creates the main window.*\n\n*Creates a frame in the main window, which he labels container.* **I don't know what this frame does or why it's here. It seems like it might be just an initial frame that he's creating so he can set up some of the formatting for all windows to come? Because it seems like that's all he does with this container.**\n\n*Initializes a dictionary where he's going to later store all of the references for any frame he creates, so that he can retrieve them more quickly/easily.*\n\n*Creates a for loop that loops through the tuple list of frames and adds them to the dictionary.* **I have no idea why he just doesn't list them out when he initializes the dictionary.**\n\n*Calls the as of yet undefined method show_frame(StartPage) which essentially just makes sure the first time this main window appears, it's showing the StartPage.*\n\n*Creates the show_frame method, which essentially accesses a given frame from the dictionary, and then moves that frame to be the top one in the stack.*\n\n*Creates a new class that inherits the tk.Frame class, so instantiating this class is going to create a new frame and then add some stuff to it. This is the StartPage frame.*\n\n*Initializes the frame.*\n\n*Creates a label that this Startpage frame has access to, with certain formatting like font and size included.*\n\n*Packs in the label (I assume because this is a simple example, this might be gridded in if we were doing something more complicated).*\n\n*Creates a button that Startpage has access to to go to frame PageOne. He uses a lambda function here because the command argument in the Button isn't allowed to have arguments.* **I understand that he doesn't want to do it this way: command=controller.show_frame(PageOne) because if he does, then when this button is created it will call the function PageOne immediately, rather than waiting for a button push. I don't understand why tkinter buttons work like this.**\n\n*Packs in the button.*\n\n*Creates a new class PageOne, which is exactly the same as StartPage, so I won't repeat that.*\n\n*Instantiates the class to the name 'program', which sets of the init of example window and gets the ball rolling.*\n\n*Includes the mainloop to ensure that the program can continue to run to take new input from the user, evaluate it, and use it.*\n\n\n**Overall: It seems like rather than calling a main function and moving through it, he's basically creating a class that is serving the same purpose as a main function. What is the reason behind this particular way of doing things? Is this the object-oriented paradigm I'm hearing so much about? My understanding was that classes are essentially 'blueprints', and you instantiate a class when you want an object to match your 'blueprint'. Here, it seems as though instantiating our 'blueprint' is serving in lieu of a main function. Why do it this way? Why create a new class for each new page, rather than creating a generic class that we can instantiate anytime we want a new frame and then editing it once we've created it?**",

Completely lost. \n\nI can write a code that prints out 4+4 and it says 8 in this program, but when I publish the code that says 4+4 to my site, how is the site going to be able to read the Python? Do you need to install compilers on websites? \n\nI'm 100% sure this questions sounds horribly stupid, but if you wouldn't mind enlightening me on how this local compiler is helping me at all?

I made my app with Unity and programmed it with C#. I think Unity is a nice program that really helps with making a game application. So if you want to make a game, I would definitely recommend it.\n\nAnd thanks for motivating everybody that's having a hard time to learn programming!\n",

I've never had to deal with message queuing systems before, and I feel that this could also relate to programs where you have to use n amount of different services based on whichever use case.\n\nHere is the question:\n\nSuppose you're designing a distributed worker library, and would like it to be able to queue jobs using a number of different message queuing services (RabbitMQ, Amazon Simple Queue Service, ZeroMQ). What's a good way to handle making our code work with each of these services?\n\nChoices are below:\n\nhttps://i.stack.imgur.com/CpqOU.png\n\nI ended up answering the third one (4th was just marked during the screenshot) because\n\n(1) a switch statement seems too duct-tapey\n\n(2) that seems to be inefficient\n\n(4) seems like it would take up a lot of time to write a bunch of different libraries\n\n(3) abstraction and extensibility seems like the most maintainable option?\n\nIs my reasoning correct? Is there anything specific for distributed workers that would make the other choices more optimal? To answer a more general question, what would be the best way to incorporate different libraries using one endpoint?",

My aim is to re-acclimate myself to Rails development and hopefully help new web devs who are stuck in the \"where do I start?\" phase.\n\nIn my previous post, I looked through my planning file and decided that the logical next feature to build was the voting system. This sort of feature isn't a typical CRUD resource, so this post will focus on creating a rough outline of how I should implement this feature.\n\n**Determine which actions a vote needs**\n\nAlthough votes will have their own model, their purpose is to act almost like a pseudo-attribute of links. They're not something meant to stand on their own nor are they intended to be content on the site. Their purpose is to give links a rank and, later on, to determine the karma of users. This means that they won't have all the typical CRUD actions.\n\nUsing reddit as the model for this demonstration, here's how I intend votes to be used:\n\n* Users can click a button to give a positive (\"up\") vote to a link\n* Users can click that same button to remove their positive vote from a link\n* Users can click a different button to give a negative (\"down\") vote to a link\n* Users can click that same button to remove their negative vote from a link\n* Users can click on the upvote button to add a positive vote to a link, then click on the downvote button to both remove their positive vote from and add a negative vote to the link\n* Users can click on the downvote button to add a negative vote to a link, then click on the upvote button to both remove their negative vote from and add a positive vote to the link\n\nReading through those actions, votes will only ever be created and deleted. There are no situations in which a vote will be edited or updated, so those actions won't be necessary to the feature. Deleting and switching votes isn't really possible without the votes being tied to users, though. For now, I need to focus on just adding new upvotes and downvotes to a link. Then, once I have user accounts, I can check whether a user has voted on a link to determine whether I need to add a vote, delete a vote, or change a vote.\n\n**Determine how to implement the actions**\n\nThe only attribute a vote needs to have \u2013 aside from belonging to a link \u2013 is the type of vote being cast. This could possibly be a boolean attribute, with upvotes being `true` and downvotes being `false`. Then I could count the votes of a link with the `true` attribute and subtract the votes of a link with the `false` attribute to get the rank of the link.\n\nSince the model for this application is reddit, though, I can't have a typical \"new X\" form for adding a vote to a link. To make voting more user-friendly, I want users to be able to simply click an upvote or downvote link to create a new vote of that type.\n\nWith that in mind, I think the best way to implement the create action would be to define routes that create upvote and downvote paths. Those paths could then be used in a `link_to` call with the `method: :post` option to create each vote type directly without the need for a submission form. These routes would call either an `upvote` or a `downvote` action in the votes controller, which creates the vote with the appropriate vote type (either a boolean, like mentioned above or perhaps a string of either `'up'` or `'down'`).\n\nThe upvote and downvote actions would then simply redirect to the root page, which isn't a good long-term solution but acceptable for the minimum requirements version of the application.\n\n**Summary and next steps**\n\nI need to create a vote model that belongs to links and has an attribute for setting the type of vote. This type could either be a boolean value \u2013 `true` for up and `false` for down \u2013 or a string \u2013 `'up'` or `'down'`. [1] At the moment, I'm leaning towards going with a boolean value since it leaves less room for error. If it were a string, someone could theoretically write code that creates a new link with the type 'loose' or 'turnip', which would throw off the up and down vote counts.\n\nI also need to define upvote and downvote routes that map to upvote and downvote actions in a votes controller. These actions will create a new vote of the appropriate type and redirect the user to the root path. I'll implement these actions in `link_to` calls with the `method:` set to `:post`.\n\nWith this rough plan of action in mind, my next step is to start writing tests to implement the voting system.\n\nIf you'd like to view the source code for the app, you can do so [here](https://github.com/bridge-ro/rankit). Bear in mind that changes in these posts may not have been pushed to the repository yet, depending on when you're reading this.\n\nThank you for reading.\n\n[1] This single vote model plan is different than the previous way I implemented the voting system of a similar reddit clone I made in the past. In that project, I created separate upvote and downvote models that inherited a shared set of methods from a `vote.rb` concern in Rails. This implementation meant that I had to query the database twice for calculating link ranks, so I'm hoping I can cut down on that by trying this single model strategy.\n\nLike I've said before, this demonstration isn't intended to be a tutorial. It's more like a documentation of me re-introducing myself to web development with Rails. It's possible that this is the wrong way to develop this feature and I don't want to hide my mistakes if this implementation doesn't work \u2013 one of my next posts may very well end with me reverting back to the start of this feature and trying again.\n\nAnd I don't think that would be a bad thing, really. In app development, you don't always know what will work. You may end up walking down a dead-end path, meaning you have to turn around and try a different road.\n\nI know from my own experience how disheartening it can be when I mess something up, let alone how overwhelming it feels when I don't know how to get things back to the way they were. So if this does happen, I hope I can use it as an opportunity to show other beginners how to recover from such mistakes without getting too discouraged.",

I\u2019m also creating all of the curriculum from scratch since it hasn\u2019t been taught before. I was an engineer before becoming a teacher with limited programming experience, so I\u2019m also on a learning curve. \u00a0I took all of the college programming courses required for electrical engineering, but didn\u2019t use any of it in for a few years, so I\u2019m rusty.\n\n\nThat being said, I decided to teach the kids python. I thought it would be a great first language because of its intuitiveness and readability. I\u2019m open to introducing java or javascript next semester, but I think I\u2019ll just try to go more in depth with python.\n\n\nProblem:\n\nNow with the problem. IT department will not let me install anything on the computers. I\u2019m 1 and half months into it, with no IDE installed like I\u2019ve been asking. They won\u2019t give me the admin password for anything. I used repl.it for online coding classroom where I created assignments and gave them feedback. I found it very useful and reasonably priced($5/student/yr) compared to other alternatives. \u00a0My administration said they would pay for it, but that also hasn\u2019t happened. My free trial ran out and I\u2019m running out of ideas on how to conduct my classroom.\n\n\nWhat I\u2019ve tried:\n\nAll students have a chromebook. Developer mode is locked, so I can\u2019t install linux on them. I have a computer lab with desktop computers, but like I said, I can\u2019t install anything. I can however boot from a linux usb, so I\u2019m toying with the idea to have the students bring a flashdrive to install linux and boot from that. \u00a0I would like to get something for their chromebooks so they could work from home if needed also.\n\n\nI\u2019d like to introduce them to pygame and some webscraping libraries, but I have difficulties running these on the online IDE\u2019s that I\u2019ve tried.\n\n\nAny advice on how to proceed? The students are starting to get bored with the assignments that we\u2019ve been working on limited by an online IDE, so I would like to introduce more \u201crealworld\u201d applciations like webscraping and simple game design where we can interact with files and different packages\n\n\nThe good.\n\nI have full autonomy over my classroom with little/no oversight. The expectations are very low. Administration doesn\u2019t really have a grasp on what programming entails, since the other teacher is a coach who just watched movies.\n\n\nSo any ideas on good online IDE\u2019s and some projects that can be created on them? Or any ways around the system that I haven\u2019t thought of?\n",

This sub has been amazing also. you guys are great!\n\nI have been creating some small games (basic guessing games). When I create the game, I try to write an algorithm to beat the game I made.\n\nNow. I have watched a lot of neural network and machine learning videos. Does the AI re-write its programming or another separate program? and then can you read the algorithm it created?\n\nIt's a feat to build a program to beat world champions at the game go. But to learn why it makes the moves it does sounds pretty important. or is it too complex?. Any information? \n\nThank you. ",

//get input from socket\n                //System.out.println(\"Created reader\");\n                \n                String inputLine;\n                \n                \n               // System.out.println(\"About to read\");\n                \n                \n                while (DIS.available() > 0) {\n                    inputLine = DIS.readUTF();\n                    System.out.println(inputLine);\n                }\n              \n            \n            }\n        } catch (Exception e) {\n            System.out.println(\"Exception caught when trying to listen on port \"\n                    + portNumber + \" or listening for a connection\");\n            System.out.println(e.getClass().getSimpleName());\n        }\n\n\nThis kind of works, except it takes a very long time(seconds) before the server socket is accepted. It also only works in onprogresschanged , which leads me to believe that multiple attempts of \n\n    //Send text over wifi\n                                SendText ST = new SendText(getApplicationContext());\n                                ST.execute(String.valueOf(progressvalue), RecieverIP, RecieverPort);\n                                ST.cancel(false);\nare needed before one succeeds at creating the socket and connecting to the pc. How can I make sure that one tap, or one call of the function will be enough to send the string?\n",

Although the university has been very supportive, I've become increasingly worried concerning the standard of my mathematical background, and I was wondering what might be the best resources for \"catching-up,\" as it were, prior to making an entirely committed, full-time start.\n\nI will be required to take modules in Integration, Finite Calculus, and Foundations of Euclidean Geometry this semester. Are there any particular books, websites, or other resources the /r/LearnProgramming community could possibly recommend as a means of securing a strong foothold in these areas at this late stage? Preferably something that might tide me over into more advanced topics in those same subjects as the semester progresses.\n\nAs a brief aside, I'm not only searching for resources, but I'm also open to suggestions as to how best to use those same resources. Do I simply watch a video of a lecture, or is there a particular note-taking method I should apply to same? When it comes to tackling problem sets, are questions welcome on /r/LearnProgramming, or is there another avenue for seeking advice on homework and such?\nMany thanks in advance, /r/LearnProgamming, I look forward to applying all of your advice at the earliest available opportunity! :-)",

This extension would be for my job as we're using a very outdated site that takes far too much work to do something simple.\n\nThe site itself has a lot of input forms on a customer page, and I have the ID of the fields.  What I'm hoping to do is have a plugin that you click while on the page that then pulls the info from the specific form fields and populates an email message with them based upon a specific template.\n\nI've already got it to pull the email up with a mailto and I believe I have my variables set properly but every time I try to run the extension, it doesn't seem to pull any info.  I'm not sure if it's even injecting the script into the current tab to pull from that, which means it may just be trying to pull info from fields that don't even exist.\n\nWhat do I need to do to get it to pull that info?",

What I want is to move the files from the big folder to a series of folders according to the translated sample name. \nExample:\n\nFolder A contains the files:\n\n* AAGAGGCA-AAGGAGTA.gz\n* AAGAGGCA-ACTGCATA.gz\n* AAGAGGCA-AGAGTAGA.gz\n* CAAGCGA-AAGGAGATA.gz\n* CGTACTAG-CTCTCTATA.gz\n\nThe text file is like this:\n\n* AAGAGGCA-AAGGAGTA | DEGWAS028\n* AAGAGGCA-ACTGCATA  | KAUWAS002\n* AAGAGGCA-AGAGTAGA | BRUIMI021\n* CAAGCGA-AAGGAGATA | SNOMIC030\n* CGTACTAG-CTCTCTATA | DEGIMI013\n\n(the | means that they are in different columns)\n\nWhat I would like to do is write some kind of script that will look at the folder files and then according to the text file, it will move the file from the folder to a subfolder named WAS, IMI or MIC (letters 4,5 and 6 of the second column on the text file) so in the end I will have these three subfolders containing the corresponding file (without changing the original filename) for example\n\nFolder WAS\n\n* AAGAGGCA-AAGGAGTA.gz\n* AAGAGGCA-ACTGCATA.gz\n\nFolder IMI\n\n* CGTACTAG-CTCTCTATA.gz \n* AAGAGGCA-AGAGTAGA.gz\n\nFolder MIC\n\n* CAAGCGA-AAGGAGATA.gz\n\nFolder A would then be empty.\n\nCan anyone help me to script this?

With a standard calculus multi-step problem, I have no problem mentally outlining what each step would be. However, when it comes to designing the logic of even a basic function, I often find that I have to resort to outlining my ideas on paper to really get the ball rolling. If someone just verbally asks me this question, I struggle to come up with a solution, unlike how I am able to approach abstract math ideas mentally.\n\nI am sure that this is something that will just come with time, as I've heard and seen online that even experienced programmers employ rubber duck debugging or a paper scratchpad to solve problems.\n\nNonetheless, I was hoping I could perhaps get some insight on improving my mental abilities with programming logic and how serious of a hindrance this may actually be if I can't get my mental up-to-speed.\n\nThanks.",

(https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/745qs5/im_not_sure_what_type_of_software_job_im_looking/)\n\nThat seemed like the proper place. However im coming here since this seems better suited to this subreddit. Apologies for the wall of text.\n\nBasically (if you read any of the link) I haven't done any \"real\" programming since college (besides some \"basic\" stuff). Im rusty as hell at Data Structures/Algorithms and i'd like to do leetcode without struggling (I've managed to do a few easy ones, but outside of basic array/LL stuff...I struggle hard).  \n\nWhat I HAVE done in the past year or so is:\n\n* Cole Steeles web-dev course.\n* CS50x (All but final project, I actually did pretty well at this and only had to \"check solutions\" for a missing line or two in maybe two of the harder problems)\n* Entire FE and BE section of freeCodeCamp (Beta, which is honestly better) + All of the \"Projects\" (Including ones from the \"normal\" FCC)\n* A good 25 or so Easy-Medium codewars.com problems (I only spent a few days on this)\n* Both UT Austin edX Embedded Courses (Was interesting, but Embedded turns out isn't really enjoyable to me).\n\nSo it's like....I can figure out syntax and such and understand and build basic web-dev stuff. JS is probably my strongest language right now cause it's what i've used the most the past year but it's not what I want to do.\n\nWhat I **LACK** is a good foundation in DS/Algo's and \"GOOD\" object oriented programming experience. CS50x was an AWESOME refresher, like holy shit is it a good course. But it's an introductory course (And honestly probably worth 3 or so of my university classes in experience).\n\nThings i know people recommend:\n\n- The Algorithm Design Manual (By Skienna)\n- Introduction to Algorithms, 3rd Edition (Does this talk about DS too? Cause i've heard it's a bit dry and math heavy)\n- Introduction to Algorithms (MIT Course). Not sure if this is worth it if I read the books?\n- I think im gonna give firecode a try, at least an hour a day starting back at level 1 (seems like a neat site)\n\nAm I missing anything else? Grinding leetcode and reading \"CTCI\" I feel like is pre-mature. Since I don't have the proper tools yet.\n\nWhere I eventually want to be: \n\n* Able to leetcode with proper tools.\n* Competent at C++ (Ideally) or another OO language that fits the description for a job I posted above.\n* Competent in my fundamentals.\n\nAny ideas or pathways would be appreciated. Also if C++ is a proper language...is there a good book? I know  Stroustrop's is recommended a lot....but since Im not a beginner at programming...and it's pretty old is there something better?",

I have created a very simple android application in two activities (fully functional) but I have gone forward to try to modulate it by implementing the exact same thing following the Model-View-Presenter design pattern.

I thought I knew enough about interfaces and stuff like that but I am not able to advance any further, I have really debugged and tried as much as I could.\n\nNo errors in my code, just crashing. Looking for a java god who is able to see where I went wrong in my implementation. I thought it was fairly easy to implement this without the Model-View-Presenter design pattern. I really do feel like I get it though, like UI in the view etc... Really appreciate anyone who is able to take time out of their time to steer me in what I did wrong so I can correct it. Thanks!!\n\n1. First activity has only one button that when pressed; starts a second activity\n2. Second activity has two buttons, one is a Timer that starts a countdown from 10 seconds to the right of it in a textview. The other button is enabled when the timer starts and lets you click it to increase a counter that is displayed to the right.\n3.

I have a project for my Introduction to Programming class and the professor barely even explained. When asked for advice, she does not help and only answers with \n\"check the book or get a tutor\". \n\nI am not lazy, don't take it the wrong way. Moreover, book barely helped me as well. It does explain the stuff,  but it does not relate to the stuff I gotta do in this specific project. In the other hand, unfortunately, and sadly, there are no Programming tutors in my college (Montgomery College - Takoma Park, Silver Spring).\n\nSummarizing, I do not have a tutor from college, I have not been able to find someone who knows about it, and book/internet has barely helped me.

Even when it's just a question of keeping track of which parts of my own code do what, good names help a lot. I'd go so far as to say that it seems good names are as important as comments, maybe even more.\n\nHowever, I'm struggling to identify how to make my names more useful in a consistent way. Especially making names distinct and descriptive without them getting inconveniently long.\n\nAlso, is it good practice when using functions to pass them arguments with the same names as the arguments in the function or not?\n\nFor example...\n\n    main\n        foo = 1\n        bar = 2\n        sum = function (foo, bar)\n\n...should I define function like this:\n\n    function (foo, bar)\n        return foo + bar\n\nor like this:\n\n    function (x, y)\n        return x + y\n\nThe first seems more natural, but I can see issues with not having unique names for variables; what happens if I move code from one function to another which uses those names for something else?",

If you'd like to read the other eight parts, please see the links below:\n\n* [Introduction](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/71mmph/building_a_web_app_from_start_to_finish_part_1/)\n* [Planning a project](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/71mozr/building_a_web_app_from_start_to_finish_part_2/)\n* [Project setup](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/71tmce/building_a_web_app_from_start_to_finish_part_3/)\n* [Writing the first test](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/725srd/building_a_web_ap_from_start_to_finish_part_4/)\n* [Coding the first feature](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/72f72t/building_a_web_app_from_start_to_finish_part_5/)\n* [Create, edit, and delete](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/72n0yg/building_a_web_app_from_start_to_finish_part_6/)\n* [Validate the link model](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/72v0w1/building_a_web_app_from_start_to_finish_part_7/)\n* [Refactor the link resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/73vjwv/building_a_web_app_from_start_to_finish_part_8/)\n\nThe app that I'm building for this demonstration is a run of the mill reddit/HN-style Rails application called \"[rankit](https://github.com/bridge-ro/rankit).\" As a disclaimer, this isn't intended to be a Rails tutorial. My aim is to re-acclimate myself to Rails development and hopefully help new web devs who are stuck in the \"where do I start?\" phase.\n\nIn the previous post, I finished coding the core feature of my reddit clone app \u2013 the link submission feature \u2013 and refactored the small amount of code I've written so far. This completed the first iteration of my feature build cycle, consisting of the following steps:\n\n1. Decide which feature to build\n2. Write tests\n3. Write code\n4. Validate\n5. Refactor\n6. Repeat\n\nIn this post, I'm going to return to the first part of that feature cycle and determine which feature I need to work on next.\n\n**Review the planning file**\n\nWhen I start a new feature cycle, I like to review my planning file to remind myself of the \"big picture\" for the application. The first thing I do is look at the features list, find the items I completed in the previous feature cycle, and mark them as completed. I don't have a consistent way of doing this yet; on some occasions, I've deleted the items from the feature list, on others I've added something like \"COMPLETED\" to the end of each item. For this demo app, I'd like to pick a way to do it for all app I make going forward. In retrospect, I think deleting the features from the list isn't a great idea. They're not there just to act as a to-do list but also as a form of documentation for the fully-featured app idea.\n\nFor the sake of readability, I think I'll do a modified version of the second method. I'll add the word \"COMPLETED\" to the beginning of the features I've finished so far:\n\n    * COMPLETED \u2013 Users can post links to websites with a short description of the site\n    * COMPLETED \u2013 Users can edit and delete their submitted links\n    * COMPLETED \u2013 Users can view and visit links submitted by all users\n    * Users can upvote links that they like\n    * Users can downvote links that they don't like\n    * Users can see the voting rank of submitted links\n    * Users can comment on links\n    * Users can edit and delete their comments\n    * Users can view comments from other users\n    * Users can gain or lose karma depending on the upvotes and downvotes of their submissions\n    * Users can visit user profiles\n    * Users can see the karma scores of other users on their profiles\n    * Users can edit and delete their accounts\n    * Users can see the top 3 submissions of other users on their profiles\n    * Links can be sorted\n    * Links will have a sorting algorithm for top-rated submissions that factors in a link's rank and age to ensure a good mix of top and new submissions on the front page\n\nPutting it at the beginning of each item makes it easier to visually identify the finished features.\n\n**Read the minimum requirements**\n\nAfter I've updated my features list, it's time to decide which feature I should work on next. I need to make this decision within the context of the app's minimum requirements. That description represents the initial usable version of the app, meaning that those features are the ones with top priority. When still in the \"pre-launch\" stage of building, I should never work on features that are not within the scope of the minimum requirements.\n\nHere are the minimum requirements of the app:\n\n> At launch, users should be able to create accounts, submit links, and vote them up or down. Users will have a karma score and links will be sorted simply by rank. Refer to the [reddit launch screenshot](https://i.redd.it/nsg5cj41wzmy.png).\n\nFrom that description, I can quickly extract the following five features:\n\n* User accounts\n* Link submission\n* Voting system\n* Rank sorting\n* Karma scores\n\nI've finished the link submission feature, so now I need to decide which of the four remaining features to work on.\n\n**Choose the next feature to build**\n\nWhen deciding the first feature of an app to build, I like to identify the core feature of the app. That feature is the base that the rest of the application will build upon, making it a natural starting place. Similarly, I pick the second feature to work on by identifying which feature I think depends the most on the core feature.\n\nIn this example, link submission is the core feature of the app. Users will be the ones who submit links but a link does not have to exist in order for a user to exist \u2013 users are not dependent on links. Karma scores are attributes of users that they earn based on the upvotes and downvotes of their submissions. This technically makes karma dependent on links but the calculation of a karma score requires the voting system to exist as well.\n\nThe voting system and rank sorting both require the link model in order to exist. Voting on links will eventually be something that only users can do but users are not as necessary to votes as the links are. Here's one way to think of it in the context of the features in action: voting is something that users *do* and votes are something that links *have*. [1] This means that votes more dependent on links than they are on users, which makes the voting system the logical next feature to build.\n\nTo recap, I have one core feature of the app: the ability to create links. Of the four remaining minimum requirements features, the voting system is the one that's most dependent on the link model \u2013 a vote absolutely cannot exist without a link. That dependency makes me think of votes as a sort of extension of links, forming a natural trail through the rest of the features:\n\n* Once links have votes, I can rank links based on their vote count\n* Once links can be ranked, I can add users to make sure only registered users can influence the ranks of submitted links\n* Once users are involved in creating links and voting on them, I can start to calculate their karma scores based on the votes that their content receives from other users\n\nAnd once I've reached the end of that trail, the app will have all of its minimum back-end requirements.\n\n**Next steps**\n\nI've decided that the next feature I need to build is the voting system. Votes don't work like a typical CRUD resource, so my next post will discuss how I should approach building this feature.\n\nIf you'd like to view the source code for the app, you can do so [here](https://github.com/bridge-ro/rankit). Bear in mind that changes in these posts may not have been pushed to the repository yet, depending on when you're reading this.\n\nThank you for reading.\n\n[1] In the code's actual data model relationships, votes will eventually be things that `belong_to` both users and links. The wording I used here is more to express the models as steps in a workflow rather than relationships between objects.",

            "selftext": "So in my second semester of freshman year we had to take an OOP module called (surprise, surprise) OOP. In the first semester we stuck to very simple functional programming in our \"Procedural Programming\" module and so OOP seemed super alien and very confusing. I stuck with the class for as long as I could and did decently in the mid-term and projects, but that was only with the help of friends who had a better grasp on OOP than I did. Eventually I stopped turning up to lectures and failed the final exam. (not for lack of trying, though. I was doing my best to learn but I spent a good few months in and out of hospital so that threw a spanner in the works)\n\nNow, in our first semester of second year we are doing a course that is basically OOP v2 with added complexities and I started struggling from the first lecture. I am doing a Mathematics and Comp Sci degree with mostly mathematics modules and so struggling so badly with things is not what I am used to, having averaged 80%+ on my other modules through last year and so I'm really not sure how to come back from behind with a subject - especially when it isn't what I would call my area of expertise.\n\nI am really determined to learn OOP, not just to pass the exam (although that is the biggest motivator) but also to be able to say I walked away from my degree with *actual* practical skills. \n\nI have looked all over YouTube for tutorials and attempted to find books to explain the concepts in OOP but I can't find anything that offers a concrete explanation. I was tempted to purchase one of those online courses, but I just feel like I would be getting robbed if I paid for something that wasn't complete and I walked away not knowing much more than I already did. \n\nI found a free course on Udacity that I'm currently going through, and I feel like it has helped a lot with some things that I was struggling with, but when it gives you exercises to do (e.g design a hangman game with move titles imported from a .txt file) I struggle to get the code written. I know what I want to write, and I have no issue scribbling down the psuedo code, but I just feel that I don't have a sound enough knowledge of programming to write down what I need to get the program working.\n\nDoes anyone know of some really good resources that can help someone who has a very sketchy knowledge of OOP \"master\" the subject? I would be very grateful if people could weigh in, and possible give some of their own experiences with learning OOP?\n\n\nCheers",

I had to add this information in a new 'timesOrderedFromUs' column. \n\nFor example if order #342 is from Dave, and he has ordered from us 2 times before, the 'timesOrderedFromUs' column for order #342 should contain the number 3.\n\nThis is something I could not figure out how to do in access, but I did understand the logic behind it. So I set about trying to write a script that would do this for me (the alternative was to trawl through thousands of orders and manually add it to the database).\n\nAfter thinking about it for I while I realised that if everything was in date order then the only information I needed was the unique identifier. I could just use that to generate the 'timesOrderedFromUs' column, then put it back into the database.\n\nI wrote some basic code that allowed me to take in a 2D array, and output exactly what I needed. This took a little while, but I got there. The difficult part was figuring out a way to input the data so I didn't have to do it by hand.\n\nSo I figured out (and kinda botched) a way to get data from an excel spreadsheet manipulate it using the script, then export it back into an excel spreadsheet. This doens't work perfectly and adds an extra row + column but I just manually deleted those.\n\nAll in all I found this really rewarding, it was nice to be able to solve a real world problem with my knowledge. Now I'm fairly certain that I overcomplicated things a huge deal by doing it this way, but eitherway it solved the problem and I learned a great deal from it.  \n",

            "selftext": "Hello, i'm trying to code a program that does filtering and sorting stuff. So i need a huge list of people on Name-Surname-Gender format (At least 1000 names). It can be a .csv or .xlsx. I had a research on Google but the websites i found are giving maximum 200 names and i don't want to make 5 lists and combine all of them because i don't actually know how to remove duplicates with excel (name and surname is different columns).\n\nSo, is there a way to filter those duplicates out? OR is there any name-surname-gender style list generator that i can use in my project?\n\nI just need Names, Surnames and Genders. It doesn't matter how they seperated, even a comma (as in .csv files) is okay for me.\n\nUseless fact: This is actually a homework, i can easily code that on Java and C# but i'm trying to self-learn c++, so that's actually a challenge. I'm looking for a tool for a list to process, this is why i flaired this post as Resource ,not Homework. If that's wrong, feel free to warn me and i'll fix it.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nEdit: i have no idea why people are downvoting this.",

            "selftext": "Hey all,  \n  \nI see this post all the time and don't blame the folks posting for reposting so much - it's nerve wracking! And we all have unique situations that could use unique guidance, imo.  \n  \nI'm in my 4th year with 3 semesters left, so it'll be my last semester. I desperately need an internship. A recruiter recently got in touch with me through LinkedIn and I'm scheduled to take their technical phone interview for a SWE internship role!  \nI mention my year because my situation is a bit unusual. I didn't do well in discrete math and because it's a prerequisite for a lot of classes (like data structures and algorithms), I haven't taken a lot of classes people my age typically have. I feel I've got a lot of practical coding experience, and my resume is decent, but my problem solving during interviews is *complete shit*. I know practice is the only way to get better, but **I'm hoping for advice on what to study in the week leading up to the interview, given my experience level.**  \n  \n**My experience level**:  \nI'd say I can very easily solve and explain easy hacker rank problems.  \nMedium problems... not so much.  \nHard - not at all.  \nI'd like to use Python for the interview.  \nI'm not as comfortable writing algorithms as I probably should be - meaning search and sort algorithms.  \nI've got a good idea of basic data structures, like dictionaries, lists, but nothing more than theory about trees and graphs.  \n  \nI have a lot of resources the recruiter provided, and of course I'll go through previous interview questions, but here's my game plan that I'd like feedback on:  \n1. Take adderall  \n2. Practice behavioral questions for about 5% of the time (why are you interested, previous projects, etc.)  \n3. Review common searching and sorting algorithms, data structures, recursion 25%\n4. Hackerrank easy 10%  \n5. Hackerrank medium 15%  \n6. Coding on paper/whiteboard in 10-15 minute timed intervals 25%\n7. Not sure what to fill the remaining 20% of my time with  \n  \nThanks, and sorry for being the 1000000th nervous wreck to ask this",

            "selftext": "This is the eighth post in my series on building a web application from start to finish, focusing on the development process I use when building personal projects. If you'd like to read the other seven parts, please see the links below:\n\n* [Introduction](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/71mmph/building_a_web_app_from_start_to_finish_part_1/)\n* [Planning a project](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/71mozr/building_a_web_app_from_start_to_finish_part_2/)\n* [Project setup](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/71tmce/building_a_web_app_from_start_to_finish_part_3/)\n* [Writing the first test](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/725srd/building_a_web_ap_from_start_to_finish_part_4/)\n* [Coding the first feature](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/72f72t/building_a_web_app_from_start_to_finish_part_5/)\n* [Create, edit, and delete](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/72n0yg/building_a_web_app_from_start_to_finish_part_6/)\n* [Validate the link model](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/72v0w1/building_a_web_app_from_start_to_finish_part_7/)\n\nThe app that I'm building for this demonstration is a run of the mill reddit/HN-style Rails application called \"[rankit](https://github.com/bridge-ro/rankit).\" As a disclaimer, this isn't intended to be a Rails tutorial. My aim is to re-acclimate myself to Rails development and hopefully help new web devs who are stuck in the \"where do I start?\" phase.\n\nIn the previous post, I validated the `Link` model to finish the link submission feature, at least for now. Whenever I finish a feature, I like to review my code and refactor it, if necessary, before moving on to the next feature. In this post, I'm going to look through the code I've written so far and see what I can clean up.\n\n**Create a git branch for refactoring**\n\nIn the past, I didn't create branches for refactoring. At the time, I figured that I wasn't changing functionality by refactoring, so branches weren't necessary. Now I think I was obviously wrong; I don't know whether a refactor may accidentally break something in the code, so creating a branch is important. If I do break something, I want to be able to revert to the master branch.\n\nI'm going to use branches for refactoring from now on, starting with this app:\n\n    git branch refactor_links\n    git checkout refactor_links\n    \n**Decide where to start reviewing/refactoring**\n\nPicking a place to start reviewing code usually depends on how far along in the app I am. Since I refactor at the end of each CRUD feature, I generally like to go through each part of the MVC pattern one at a time, followed by my specs. When I do this, I usually start with the model since it tends to require the least amount of refactoring. Then I review the controller, which is more likely to have a few things I can refactor that will usually stay in the one controller file. Then I check my view directory for the resource, where refactoring can be more complex since the duplication may be across multiple files (like shared forms, for example). I finish the refactoring process by reviewing my specs.\n\nThis early on in an app, though, I don't always go through things in that order with that level of detail. With only one resource so far, the amount of refactoring needed is usually pretty light. The types of things I'll be refactoring at this stage are usually the same across most CRUD apps, so I already have a good idea of what I need to refactor. Plus I haven't done a whole lot of coding in the app yet, so there's a good chance the things I need to refactor are still fresh in my mind.\n\nIn these situations, I would normally just go to the few things that I know need to be refactored and knock them out quickly so I can move to the next feature. Since this is a demonstration, however, I'm going to go through the more detailed process of checking through everything in the order I described before: my model, controller, views, and specs.\n\n**Refactor the link model**\n\nI start by opening my `link.rb` file and reviewing the code, what little there is so far:\n\n    class Link < ApplicationRecord\n      validates :description, :url, presence: true\n      validates :description, length: { maximum: 180 }\n      validates :url, format: /(\\A(http|https))(\\:\\/\\/)(.*\\.?)((\\.{1}.{2,})\\z)/\n    end\n  \nIn this situation, there doesn't seem to be a whole lot that I can do to make this code better. The only thing I can think of is to realign the validations \u2013 grouping the description validations in one group and the url validations in another \u2013 which will cut down one `validates` call:\n\n    class Link < ApplicationRecord\n      validates :description, presence: true, length: { maximum: 180 }\n      validates :url, presence: true, format: /(\\A(http|https))(\\:\\/\\/)(.*\\.?)((\\.{1}.{2,})\\z)/\n    end\n    \nIt's not a major change but it does tighten the code up a little bit. Whenever I refactor something, I also like to run my specs to make sure I didn't break anything. I didn't expect this refactor to mess anything up \u2013 and it didn't \u2013 but it's better to be safe than sorry:\n\n    Submitting a new link\n      adds the link to the database\n      redirects the user to the link index\n      displays the link in the list of submitted links\n\n    Deleting a link\n      deletes the link from the database\n      redirects the user to the link index\n      removes the link from the list of submitted links\n    \n    Editing a link\n      updates the link's attributes\n      redirects the user to the link index\n      displays the link's new details in the list of submitted links\n    \n    Viewing the links index\n      shows a list of submitted websites as links to those sites\n    \n    Link\n      with proper attributes\n        has a description\n        has a url\n      with improper attributes\n        is invalid if the description is over 180 characters\n        is invalid if the url is not a properly formatted HTTP/HTTPS url\n      without a description or url\n        is invalid\n    \n    Finished in 0.65945 seconds (files took 3.55 seconds to load)\n    15 examples, 0 failures\n    \nNote that I won't copy this output every time I run my specs other than this first time to illustrate that I run them after each refactor. For the rest of this post, you can safely assume that I'm running them at the end of each step.\n\n**Refactor the links controller**\n\nThe model was pretty easy, so now it's time to review the controller (`links_controller.rb`):\n\n    class LinksController < ApplicationController\n      def index\n        @links = Link.all\n      end\n    \n      def new\n        @link = Link.new\n      end\n    \n      def create\n        @link = Link.new(params.require(:link).permit(:description, :url))\n    \n        if @link.save\n          redirect_to root_url\n        else\n          render :new\n        end\n      end\n    \n      def edit\n        @link = Link.find(params[:id])\n      end\n    \n      def update\n        @link = Link.find(params[:id])\n    \n        if @link.update(params.require(:link).permit(:description, :url))\n          redirect_to root_url\n        else\n          render :edit\n        end\n      end\n\n      def destroy\n        @link = Link.find(params[:id])\n        @link.destroy\n        redirect_to root_url\n      end\n    end\n    \nThe refactoring needed here is much more obvious \u2013 there's pretty clear duplication that I need to fix. The first one that stands out to me is the params permission in the `create` and `update` actions:\n\n    params.require(:link).permit(:description, :url)\n    \nInstead of passing this directly to the actions, I can turn it into a private method and call it in the actions:\n\n    private\n    \n    def link_params\n      params.require(:link).permit(:description, :url)\n    end\n    \nNow the `create` and `update` methods look much cleaner:\n\n    def create\n      @link = Link.new(link_params)\n      # Rest of method omitted...\n    end\n    \n    def update\n      @link = Link.find(params[:id])\n    \n      if @link.update(link_params)\n      # Rest of method omitted...\n    end\n    \nThe second duplicated code is the `@link = Link.find(params[:id])`, which is being called in 3 different actions (edit, update, and delete). If I had a `show` action, there would be 4 calls to that same bit of code. Taking care of this duplication is pretty easy. First, like I did with `link_params`, I define a new private method to put the code in:\n\n    private\n    \n    def set_link\n      @link = Link.find(params[:id])\n    end\n    \nThen I can use a Rails helper method called `before_action`, which lets me choose a method to run before other actions in the controller. Using the `only` option, I can specifically choose which methods I want `set_link` to run in front of:\n\n    before_action :set_link, only: [:edit, :update, :destroy]\n    \nWith the `before_action` in place, I can cut the `Link.find` call out of the edit, update, and destroy actions:\n\n    def edit\n    end\n    \n    def update\n      if @link.update(link_params)\n        redirect_to root_url\n      else\n        render :edit\n      end\n    end\n    \n    def destroy\n      @link.destroy\n      redirect_to root_url\n    end\n    \nThat takes care of the duplication issues. My last refactor has to do more with personal preference. The `if` statements in the `create` and `update` actions are a little bulky looking to me. I want to switch them to a ternary operation, which looks much cleaner:\n\n    def create\n      @link = Link.new(link_params)\n      @link.save(link_params) ? redirect_to(root_url) : render(:new)\n    end\n    \n    def update\n      @link.update(link_params) ? redirect_to(root_url) : render(:edit)\n    end\n    \nMy refactored links controller looks like this:\n\n    class LinksController < ApplicationController\n      before_action :set_link, only: [:edit, :update, :destroy]\n\n      def index\n        @links = Link.all\n      end\n    \n      def new\n        @link = Link.new\n      end\n    \n      def create\n        @link = Link.new(link_params)\n        @link.save ? redirect_to(root_url) : render(:new)\n      end\n    \n      def edit\n      end\n    \n      def update\n        @link.update(link_params) ? redirect_to(root_url) : render(:edit)\n      end\n    \n      def destroy\n        @link.destroy\n        redirect_to root_url\n      end\n    \n      private\n    \n      def set_link\n        @link = Link.find(params[:id])\n      end\n    \n      def link_params\n        params.require(:link).permit(:description, :url)\n      end\n    end\n    \nAt this point I realize that I didn't commit to git, which I like to do after I finish refactoring a file. I take care of that now for both the model and the controller:\n\n    git commit -am \"Refactor link model and controller\"\n    \n**Refactor the link views**\n\nNow it's time to look through my view templates and see what I need to refactor. I like to start with the index page before moving through the other action templates one by one. Thankfully, there's nothing in the `index.html.erb` that needs to be refactored at this point:\n\n    <article>\n      <ul>\n        <% @links.each do |link| %>\n          <li>\n            <%= link_to link.description, link.url %>\n            <br>\n            <%= link_to 'Delete', link, method: :delete, data: { confirm: \"Are you sure you want to delete this link?\" } %>\n          </li>\n        <% end %>\n      </ul>\n    </article>\n    \nIt's ugly, yes, but the code itself is doing what it needs to do. I'll pretty things when I start styling the application.\n\nThat leaves the new and edit pages, which are practically identical. The only difference is the text of the submit button:\n\n    <%= form_for(@link) do |f| %>\n      <fieldset>\n        <p>\n          <%= f.label :description %>\n          <%= f.text_field :description, autofocus: true %>\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          <%= f.label :url %>\n          <%= f.text_field :url %>\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          <%= f.submit 'Submit Link' %>\n        </p>\n      </fieldset>\n    <% end %>\n    \nIn this situation, I want to create a form template that I can drop into the new and edit views. I can do this using a partial in Rails, which is easy to do. First, I create a new view file called `_form.html.erb` in the `views/links` directory and paste the form into it. Then I use an `if` statement to determine whether the form is for creating a new link or editing an existing link. If it's a new link, I want the button text to say 'Submit Link'. If it's an existing link, I want it to say 'Update Link':\n\n    <%= form_for(@link) do |f| %>\n      <fieldset>\n        <p>\n          <%= f.label :description %>\n          <%= f.text_field :description, autofocus: true %>\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          <%= f.label :url %>\n          <%= f.text_field :url %>\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          <% if @link.new_record? %>\n            <%= f.submit 'Submit Link' %>\n          <% else %>\n            <%= f.submit 'Update Link' %>\n          <% end %>\n        </p>\n      </fieldset>\n    <% end %>\n    \nNow I can delete the forms in the new and edit templates and replace them with a call to render the form partial:\n\n    <%= render 'form' %>\n    \nThose are the only views I have right now and all my specs still pass, so it's time for another commit:\n\n    git commit -am \"Refactor link views\"\n    \nThat finishes the refactoring for the MVC items, so now it's time to take a look through my specs.\n\n**Refactor the link specs**\n\nRefactoring specs tends to go pretty quick. As I add more features to an app, it becomes more and more likely that those features will break some of my specs. This is usually due to minor things like new attributes that are required for a model to be valid that I didn't include in the earlier specs. Since those issues arise when I run my new feature specs, I tend to fix them as they pop up.\n\nAs for duplication issues, the way I write my specs tends to avoid duplication from the get-go. So when I review my specs, I'm looking for any duplication I may have overlooked as well as places where my specs are either unclear or clunky looking.\n\nSince there's usually a higher number of individual files to review when refactoring specs, I generally just start at the top of the list in a spec directory and work my way down.\n\nDue to the amount of code in the specs, I'm not going to copy/paste the specs that I don't need to refactor in this post. I'll have a link to the GitHub repository at the end of this post if you want to take a look at them.\n\nReading through my feature specs, everything looks pretty clean right now. My link model spec, however, has something that's bugging me:\n\n    require 'rails_helper'\n    \n    RSpec.describe Link, type: :model do\n      context \"with proper attributes\" do\n        let!(:link) { Link.create(link_attributes) }\n    \n        it \"has a description\" do\n          link.valid?\n          expect(link.errors[:description].any?).to eq false\n        end\n    \n        it \"has a url\" do\n          link.valid?\n          expect(link.errors[:url].any?).to eq false\n        end\n      end\n    \n      context \"with improper attributes\" do\n        # Rest of code omitted...\n      end\n    \n      context \"without a description or url\" do\n        let!(:link) { Link.create(link_attributes(description: \"\", url: \"\")) }\n    \n        it \"is invalid\" do\n          link.valid?\n          expect(link.errors[:description].any?).to eq true\n          expect(link.errors[:url].any?).to eq true\n        end\n      end\n    end\n    \nThe first and the last context are what stick out to me. These two tests are basically the inverse of one another but the structure of the tests are noticeably different. In retrospect, it doesn't really make sense for the third context to be its own grouping. A link without a description or a url is a link with improper attributes, so it makes more sense to test those scenarios in the \"with improper attributes\" context. That makes the structure of the individual tests themselves \u2013 and the context groupings as a whole \u2013 more consistent. I also want to change the wording of the \"with proper attributes\" tests to match that of the tests in the \"with improper attributes\" context.\n\nWith these changes, the link model spec looks cleaner and reads more naturally:\n\n    require 'rails_helper'\n    \n    RSpec.describe Link, type: :model do\n      context \"with proper attributes\" do\n        let!(:link) { Link.create(link_attributes) }\n    \n        it \"is valid with a description of 180 characters or less\" do\n          link.valid?\n          expect(link.errors[:description].any?).to eq false\n        end\n    \n        it \"is valid with a properly formatted HTTP/HTTPS url\" do\n          link.valid?\n          expect(link.errors[:url].any?).to eq false\n        end\n      end\n    \n      context \"with improper attributes\" do\n        let!(:link) { Link.create(link_attributes(description: \"Snapchat's caption character limit is 80. Twitter's character limit is 140. An SMS text message limit is 160. Pinterest pins can have up to 500 characters. Instagram captions and comments can fetch 2,200 characters.\", url: \"Loose turnip dot government\" )) }\n        let!(:blank_link) { Link.create(link_attributes(description: \"\", url: \"\")) }\n    \n        it \"is invalid if the description is blank\" do\n          blank_link.valid?\n          expect(blank_link.errors[:description].any?).to eq true\n        end\n    \n        it \"is invalid if the description is over 180 characters\" do\n          link.valid?\n          expect(link.errors[:description].any?).to eq true\n        end\n    \n        it \"is invalid if the url is blank\" do\n          blank_link.valid?\n          expect(blank_link.errors[:description].any?).to eq true\n        end\n    \n        it \"is invalid if the url is not a properly formatted HTTP/HTTPS url\" do\n          link.valid?\n          expect(link.errors[:url].any?).to eq true\n        end\n      end\n    end\n    \nWhen running `rspec`:\n\n    Link\n      with proper attributes\n        is valid with a description of 180 characters or less\n        is valid with a properly formatted HTTP/HTTPS url\n      with improper attributes\n        is invalid if the description is blank\n        is invalid if the description is over 180 characters\n        is invalid if the url is blank\n        is invalid if the url is not a properly formatted HTTP/HTTPS url\n        \nEverything still passes, meaning I'm done with my refactoring. It's time to commit my changes, merge back to the master branch, and push to GitHub:\n\n    git commit -am \"Refactor link model specs\"\n    git checkout master\n    git merge refactor_links\n    git push -u origin master\n    \n**Refactoring vs. premature optimization**\n\nMost of what I refactored in this post are standard Rails practices that I would normally do when I first code the features. The main two examples of this are the `set_link` and `link_params` private methods in the links controller. For the sake of demonstrating the refactoring process, I didn't define these methods when I first set up the related actions in previous posts. In practice, I usually define them when I first need them since it takes so little extra time.\n\nThis may raise the question of whether this is premature optimization. As I've said before, I still consider myself a beginning web dev, so don't take my words here as expert opinion. For methods as small, simple, and quick as these \u2013 which are also pretty standard in Rails apps \u2013 it feels more like following Rails conventions than like premature optimization.\n\nFor things that would take longer to set up from the get-go, I'll tend to just do what needs to be done for it to work and refactor for improvements or removing duplication later.\n\n**Feature cycle overview**\n\nWith the refactoring completed, I've finished going through the cycle for adding a feature to an app. This seems like a good time to recap my process up to this point:\n\n* I start by completing my project planning template, which consists of writing an overview of the app, extracting all the features I'd like the fully finished app to have, writing out its data models and their relationships, and defining a minimum requirements version of the app \u2013 what some may call the \"launch version\" (or \"MVP\", if you prefer startup lingo).\n* I then read through my planning file and identify the core feature of the app; what's the one feature that I would consider the entire point of the app, the thing that it should do if absolutely nothing else? This is the first feature I need to build.\n* Once I've identified the core feature, I start building the CRUD actions of that feature in the following order: index, show, create, update, and destroy. I build each action by first writing tests that explain what I expect the user to do and how I expect the app to respond. Those tests help guide me in building each feature step-by-step.\n* When all of the CRUD actions are finished, I write validations for the model using the same test-first approach.\n* After I've validated the model, I review the code I've written and refactor where necessary. I do this by starting in the MVC pattern: I check the model, then the controller, and then the view templates. Once I've refactored those, I review my tests to see if there's anything I should clean up there as well.\n\nThose last three items form a feature building cycle that I repeat for every other feature in the app: identify the next feature to build, go through the CRUD actions test-first, validate, and refactor.\n\nIn my next post, I'm going to look at my planning file to determine which feature I should build next.\n\nIf you'd like to view the source code for the app, you can do so [here](https://github.com/bridge-ro/rankit). Bear in mind that changes in these posts may not have been pushed to the repository yet, depending on when you're reading this.\n\n**Series note**\n\nTo everyone who has been reading through these posts, thank you very much for following along. To those of you who shared your own stories with me, thank you for opening up. Your encouragement and own personal motivation makes me glad that I decided to write these posts. Truthfully, I backed out of the first couple of attempts I made when trying to start the series due to a fear of putting myself out there. Seeing that some people have found them useful tells me that I made the right decision.\n\nI'd also like to apologize for the gap between this post and the last one. I've had a busy couple of weeks at work lately, so I hope to catch up with this series now that things are calming down at the day job.\n\nThank you all for reading.",

            "selftext": "I've been working on a 24-bit virtual machine to help me learn more about computers and programming in general and was hoping to find a bit more information on memory mapped input/output and hardware interrupts.\n\nAt the moment I have most of the opcodes implemented and about have of them implementated in an assembler. At the moment I can load a 'rom' and the machine will load it into 'memory' and run through the instructions until it reaches an $FF in memory then it ends and dumps the register states to a terminal.\n\nAt the time I started this, I was interested in learning to program the snes but it seemed frustrating and somewhat unrewarding so I took what I understood about how the snes worked and tried to simplify it and make it easier (and more fun) to program.\n\nThe CPU has 16 16-bit registers that are byte or word addressable and one special 8-bit flag register modifiable through special op codes. The first 8 are general purpose registers. The upper 8 are special registers that have specific functions. It has 24-bit memory addressing using either the upper or lower byte from one register as an offset register and the word from another as the 16-bit address. Memory is separated into 256 pages of 65535 bytes each allowing 16mb of addressable memory.  Instructions are read one word at a time and each instruction will move the instruction pointer to where it needs to be at the end of the instruction.\n\nMy overall goal is to allow some basic graphic output and input handling and maybe eventually simulated block devices for storage. My plan is to use BearLibTerminal for input/output. Its a fairly small, SDL, based pseudoterminal that allows characters and graphical tiles to be treated the same way. Its also a runtime library that can be configured through an external text file so the hassle of dealing with graphics stored in memory is avoided.\n\nThe part I'm not sure about is how to send input from the 'terminal' to the machine and output from the machine to the 'terminal'. I was thinking of using an area of memory to map to some basic terminal functions. Setting an address would open a terminal another would clear and refresh it. I was going to use a page or two as screen buffers that can be drawn to the screen. How they're drawn would depend on the current mode of the terminal.\n\nInput would be mapped into a different section of memory. I was thinking of using a few bytes to store raw key presses and using an interrupt to copy them from there to a different area of memory before the next instruction is carried out. \n\nThe part I'm not sure about is exactly how interrupts work and how I can have my processor jump in the middle of an instruction to deal with an interrupt.  I'm also not sure if this is even how I should go about doing this. If anyone has any experience in this and could share some advice or could point me in a direction where I can learn more about this it'd be very much appreciated. I've read through both the nes and snesdev wikis and the docs for the 6502 and 65816 processors several times and studied the memory maps for both machines. I'm programming my machine in D so I also took a look at the source for this project: https://code.dlang.org/packages/gbaid\nand it helped but I'm still sort of lost.

Mine was built using ColdFusion and Oracle 9 and supported mobile phones that supported WML at the time.  Fast forward 10+ years later and I am looking to build a similar app but will be used to calculate repair costs.  So it will ask a series of questions and based on the answers it will output a repair cost.  Some questions will have direct costs and some will be used to set multipliers for other questions values.  I should say that my skills have evolved to be more on the IT side of things versus development so I am a little behind on the latest trends and general coding concepts.  I am 100% capable of designing a relational database schema to make this happen but I am wondering if there are better ideas.  \n\nSo my question is about the methodology for building the survey and storing the answers.  My previous app had a set of tables in an oracle database to save the metadata for the surveys and the responses.  It was designed as you'd expect with tables for surveys, questions, options, responses, attachments, and so on. \n\nI'm planning to build the app with PHP/laravel and PostgresSQL and run it on AWS.\n\nSo in 2017, do I still go with a bunch of tables in PostgreSQL or are there other concepts that may work better and be easier to manage? \n\nThanks,\n\nDavid\n\n",

So my work in upcoming 4 months is to build a few weather stations, then place them in various places in my city and let random person check values of atmospheric pressure/temperature/amount of CO2 etc. whenever they wants.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nFirst part of my task is not a big deal for me, however second one - is. The problem is to create a website which would allow a user to track values of things mentioned above, but also see values in real time. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nMy question is - which tools should I use to get rid of it asap? Websites based on ajax (jquery, something like that?) look amazing due to \"hidden refresh\", but I'm not sure if 4 months is enough to learn the whole conspect of Java. Maybe some website generator? I have no knowledge on this field so I rely on you. All I want is to allow user:\n\n* pick desired weather station from the list,\n\n* see actual values and history of them in table (maybe some charts etc.),\n\n* and ability to click on small box *contact me*, just as a courtesy.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThanks in advance for any ideas!",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone ! As mentionned in the title, I just finished my Master's in Marketing. I would like to get a data analyst job (in the filed of Marketing) and I am thinking of taking about 2 months to learn a new language before actively looking for job opportunities (I'm at my parents' so I can take some time for me). I did two 6-months interships in Market Research and I did analyze data even though I did not run the analysis by myself.\n\nThe issue is: the only tool I know to do data analysis for the moment is SPSS ibm software (which I learned at uni) which I can use for t-tests, clustering, ANOVA and few other things. Now I know the BASIC function of SQL (select/from/where/groupby) but it is not enough to get a job in the field. Also I feel like SQL is not great to actually analyze the data and compute ratios for example (but maybe I am wrong ?).\n\nI had a job interview last week for a junior data analyst position and was given an exercise which consisted of analyzing a database and evaluating the impact of a promotion campaign. Although I found the exercise to be quite easy in theory, I realized that SPSS isn't exactly the best tool for this kind of exercises and that I should look into new methods. The recruiter asked me if I could do the analysis through Python / R / SQL which I can't for instance. After doing some research, I came to the conclusion that I should learn Python and how to use the Pandas library.\n\nSo here are my questions:\n\n* Do you think that learning Python / Pandas is the right choice (or maybe I should look more into SQL tools)? It would be my first language, although I had introduction classes to HTML CSS and SQL in the past\n* If so, should I start with \"general\" Python tutorial or go straight for Pandas tutorial ? \n* Do you think two months of following tutorials is enough to have a enough knowledge to do simple analysis ? \n* Last one but I'd say it's the most important: do you think it is realistic to aim at such positions without a more comprehensive knowledge of programming ?\n\nThank you for reading, fellow redditors :)\n",

My only issue is here that as an autodidact learner I'm trying to map out this project in a diagram that makes sense and I just, cant? I've googled around but I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed with all the different information there is out there on how to do this and no real linear path to follow emerging. Can anyone point me in the right direction? What would you guys do when mapping out a piece of software? Do you have different diagrams for different use cases etc?\n\nCheers!",

Or is there a better way to do it? Here's an example use:  \n  \n**The folder it must be executed from:**  \ncd \"G:\\League\\RADS\\solutions\\lol_game_client_sln\\releases\\0.0.1.191\\deploy\"  \n  \n**The command to enter spectator for the given matchId:**  \n\"League of Legends.exe\" \"8394\" LoLLauncher.exe \"\" \"spectator spectator.na.lol.riotgames.com:80 encryptionKey matchId platformId\"  \n  \nI'm new to using APIs and Riot just updated theirs this year, so there's not much online about it. But this should be a common issue when wanting file paths to work on all computers. The things that will differ in the path are the root directory (G in my case, C for most), and the version - which I can easily make a variable for.  \n  \nThanks!",

I\u2019d also like to point out that I am a current CS so my thoughts might be a little ignorant seeing that I have little experience. I started programming in Java and I know everyone seems to talk shit about Java (I\u2019ll probably understand why someday in the future) but I like that it had strong typing. I know Python is considered to be pretty cool nowadays and I\u2019ve been programming in it for about a month trying to learn it and I\u2019m not going to lie there\u2019s a lot of cool things about it. However the fact that I can\u2019t type my variables makes me waste a lot of time... I think the reason python has dynamic typing is to increase readability/writability and this increasing programming efficiency. But instead of it helping me, it causes me to have lots of runtime errors and it\u2019s a nightmare trying to keep track of variables and assigning them to one another when it doesn\u2019t warn me that they\u2019re not of the same type. Is this something that I\u2019m struggling with because I am new to it or is this something that is genuinely a problem even for veteran python programmers?

I want to learn Neural networks/AI for things like games and robots. To narrow things down a little so you can understand what i want to understand i put a few videos of the types of things that interested me: *https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE3fmFTtP9g  *https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8V2sX9BhAW8  \n  *https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul0Gilv5wvY\n\nSo these are the few things that inspire me at this time and its kind of a cardboard base for my initial idea of what I want to learn. Now here's whats bothering me:\n\nI don't know anything about *anything*. And I know the common answer to that is \"Who ever does?!\" But I genuinely don't know a thing. I don't know how code works, I don't know how neural code works. I don't know the math needed to do these tasks, I don't know how to think  in AI programmer,  I don't even know who teaches the things I need to know, I don't even know the things I *don't* know! The only thing motivating me is the interest in this field the hope that once I get on a concise path to learn AI in a few years time I have at least enough knowledge to overcome the barrier of \"beginnerhood\". But in order to do that I need to know where the road is, which is why I ask:\n\nWhere do you start if you want to understand neural networks/ AI for robots and games specifically but have *zero* coding knowledge and aren't that good at math, and is there is clear cut path to start? a book, a course, a  video, anything specific and \"average  person\" friendly for a topic like this? I have  way too many questions so i'll stop here before it becomes rambly.\n\n if this thread is a bit to typical or innappropriate i'll take it down, Thanks for reading everyone, advice is welcome!",

Made in Dagenham (15)\n2. Buried (18)\n3. Despicable Me (U)\n4. The Other Guys (12A)\n5. Takers (12A)\n\nI have just studied switch and if statements so I assume that is what I will be using in this question.  Can anyone help me how to write the program because I don;t know how to do it and my book is not really helpful either.\n\nThanks",

Disclaimer: my mistake may be very simple and stupid....\n\nI am trying to make an autoencoder [as shown here](https://youtu.be/GWn7vD2Ud3M?t=104).\n\nMy neural network takes 12 matrices each containing 128 points as input for training (one at a time). If I understood correctly my autoencoder should be able to compress this 128 sized matrix to -in my case- a 84 dimensional matrix. Those matrices actually represent keypoints I extracted from 12 of from the same object.\n\nThe end goal of this project would be to do one class classification (\"is it object A or not?\"). To do this I would like to check the compressed representation of the training data and compare it with my testdata (teX), if it is the same then the object can be classified as being object A, if it isn't the same then it is not object A. The testdata is 1 single matrix containing 128elements from another new picture of the same object. Ideally it should compress the matrix to the same matrix as in the training phase (or at least something very close).\n\nYet I am a bit lost on how to check this and how to check whether my neural net is doing what I expect it to do.

I'll call this visited.\n\n2) if the last added character to visited is an end_node, than add the string to result\n\nMy problem is this..When the depth first search moves up 1+ levels in the trie, how do I know how how many levels it moved so I can cut characters off the visited string? Is there a best practice to do this?\n\nI have three ideas.  One is to keep track of which level a node is on by giving node a level attribute, and cut off as many characters on visited as how many levels a node moved up.  \n\nThe second is to iterate the visited string in reverse until the value of the current node (we just moved up 1+ levels in the trie) is found and remove all the characters following it.  The problem with this is if their were repeat characters on the path from current node to the last node visited.\n\nAnother would be to give nodes a parent attribute, but I am not sure how this would work.\n\nAny ideas?

This is the first step, and it's the step I can't get past already, auauau. In the Planet class constructor, I have it randomly set an m_Type data member to 'A'-'E' or ' ', the idea being the when I create an array of these Planet types to represent a map, it will have Planet objects with a random assortment of m_Type values. This isn't working, however, as all the Planet type objects in the array are being instantiated with the value of m_Type set to ' '.\n\nMy questions: How do I fix this? Why is this happening? I assume it's one of two causes:\n\n1. When it's filling the array, it's instantiating a single Planet object and then a bunch of copies of it.\n2. The Planet objects are instantiated at the same time, causing the \"random\" number to be the same, but aren't copies of one object.\n\n[Here is a github gist of the code.](https://gist.github.com/BambooFighting/53dadd030d0d490e34035f6e30902b0d)",

The company is a very big company so it uses a lot of different languages, so it wasn't apparent where I would be heading after the training was over, so I was pretty excited to get to use a variety of different languages. \n\nThe training program was pretty good and I got exposed to several different newer languages, but I ended up being placed on a team where it is looking like I will be primarily be using COBOL. It's an older company and there's still a ton going on within the company that deals with COBOL, so I wasn't the only one that this happened to. \n\nAnyways, I'm wondering what I should do going forward. While this company is evidence that COBOL is still alive and kicking, I don't want to make a career out of it. My plan currently is to learn as much Java on the side as I can and then try to get a job with that in the future. \n\nBy the way, I am an Information Systems major. I did have around 3 programming classes during college, but I have quite a bit of catching up to do before I am on the same level as a Comp Sci graduate. I'm currently going through the University of Helsinki's MOOC, reading through Oracle's Java tutorials, as well as trying to do some problems on Hackerrank (the easy ones for now haha). I also plan on doing a couple of side projects. Hopefully I will be able to become proficient enough with doing this on the side to get a job doing development work with Java. \n\nSo, one of my questions is, how long should I stay with this company before I start looking for other jobs? 8 months, a year, two years? I don't want to get pigeon holed by only having COBOL experience, but I also don't know how soon it would be okay to start looking. \n\nMy other questions are how does my plan sound and how adept at Java do I need to become before I can contribute as a developer at another company? \n\nOriginally posted this on cscareerquestions, but didn't get any responses. Hopefully I'll have some more luck here.\n\nAny advice on the situation and learning Java is much appreciated!",

Most examples seems to put them directly in the home folder, but that would get cluttered rather quickly in my opinion. From this link https://mallinson.ca/osx-web-development/ I got the idea of having a www folder in the home folder and then go from there.\n\n>Apache has a default location for storing website files, but I prefer to create my own web root that is independent of Apache. You can place your files anywhere you wish, but I prejust put them in a directory called /www on my main hard drive. Put yours wherever you wish. In that folder, I have a few subfolders. /www/home is a main website that I use to list all my local sites (I\u2019ll show you how to make that site dynamic later on).  /www/sites is the folder in which I place each of my other sites. Each of those site folders has a webroot (/www/sites/client1/wwwroot), and an assets folder (/www/sites/client1/assets), where I keep source files or other documents related to the site.\n\n\nBut I am not sure how Node.js will handle the localhost mapping as opposed to Apache in the link.\n\nSo how do people who have several projects to work on organize them in folders in their Mac, and is there anything I need to think about when I'll be using Node.js and Express to run them and debug locally?",

From the course website, \"Part II covers graph-processing algorithms, including minimum spanning tree and shortest paths algorithms, and string processing algorithms, including string sorts, tries, substring search, regular expressions, and data compression, and concludes with an overview placing the contents of the course in a larger context.\" I'd like to find a course that covers roughly the same material (preferably with graded assignments). Searching and sorting algorithms were already covered in part 1 of Princeton' course. \n\nThanks!!",

Change the client_id to your Client ID and go to this URL to add ot to your server\n\nhttps://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE&scope=bot&permissions=0 \n\n\nPreview of the Bot in action:\n\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/c829d41846f6bb374dbd1698d2ce7ff5.png\n\n\n[Github Repository](https://github.com/Pritesh1G/DiscordBot-KnockKnock-Jokes) for the code if you don't want to copy paste.
