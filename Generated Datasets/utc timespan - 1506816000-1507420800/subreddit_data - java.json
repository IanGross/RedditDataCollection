Wrong. Java EE is a certification mark. To label something as \"Java EE\", you need to get a license from Oracle and pass the TCKs. There are many implementations of Java EE such as WebLogic, WebSphere, JBoss, and Glassfish. EE4J is the name of the top-level project at the Eclipse Foundation. As such it is the umbrella under which the source code and TCKs for Glassfish, EclipseLink, and (hopefully) Eclipse MicroProfile will exist.\n> \n> We are months away from even starting to define the specification process that will be used in the future. However, when we do I expect that this new process will create a new certification mark which can be properly considered the new \"Java EE\" name. We will be engaging with the community in the selection of that name.\n> \n> **The existing project names will continue to be used** \n\nThey've also mentioned that the existing \"javax\" packages will continue to be used. New ones will have to be discussed.\n\nMore Info here:\nhttps://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists/ee4j-community/msg00008.html",

            "selftext": "OpenJ9's latest versions for linux are available [here](https://adoptopenjdk.net/nightly.html?variant=openjdk9-openj9).\n\nI hope a lot of people are testing it with their applications and helping report bugs and such. I've been testing it with a website I've been building with playframework, and so far I've noticed:\n\n* current versions have near openjdk performance with the default settings, while having a lot more flexibility in configuring JIT to fit the performance needs of your app\n* the default gc settings result in a significantly reduced memory footprint. My website's footprint upon being fully loaded is around 1.4GB with openjdk. It's 700MB on average with openj9.\n* OpenJ9 relinquishes heapspace to the OS much quicker than openjdk. I've seen it peak at 800MB used, then suddenly reduce in memory usage to 700, sometimes dipping to 650MB. It doesn't seem to hang on to heapspace as much as openjdk does...\n\nAll of these tests were done using httpress to send a ton of connections to the index of my website, so not the most scientific thing around, but i've seen these results mirrored in a lot of other benchmarks i've done comparing the two. Eventually I'd like to have some comprehensive, hard numbers comparing the two.\n\nIn any case, openJ9 is rough around the edges still, and doesn't work with every application (intellij, or sbt's interactive mode are two i'm aware of right now), and they need people to report bugs and get these issues smoothed out, so i hope interested people in r/java can and we can have the competition between openj9 and openjdk improve java's performance more and more!\n\nedit: I'd like to mention that the openj9 team is very responsive and has been fixing bugs extremely quickly. I've reported a few bugs so far, and the performance and gc bugs discovered from those have been fixed already.",

I thought it went really well and apparently they agreed, as I have a technical interview with them next week. I'm told it will be a Skype interview with the recruiter I spoke with on the phone, along with a Hiring Manager and one of their Senior Developers. \n\nThis was my first ever phone interview for this field, and will be my first technical interview. I'm not entirely sure what to expect. I figure they'll ask me more about general Java concepts and maybe some relatively simple coding problems, but that's just a guess. \n\nDoes anyone have a better idea of what sort of questions I'll be asked? From my understanding, Junior positions are more about having a foundation of knowledge and an ability to learn, not so much about knowing how to do any and every LeetCode problem possible (although I am doing lots of those). \n\nThe listing specifies the following;\n\n* Knowledge or experience with J2EE and Design Patterns\n* Familiarity with JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, JSON, JQuery and XML\n* JavaScript or Front-End frameworks such as Angular, Knockout, Material Design SQL or PL/SQL\n\nAnd then some nice to haves;\n\n* Experience with Oracle (PL/SQL or other Oracle technologies)\n* Working knowledge of RESTful web services\n\nAlong with the usual, \"critical thinker, problem solver, can create useful tests for code, etc\". \n\nThanks for any advice!",

There were much feedback to process and also several\nfeature requests so we are now proud to present you version `2017.2.0`.\n\n## Why Zircon?\n\nZircon started out as a simplified version of Lanterna (which is doing a lot of stuff to achieve terminal emulation which is\nnot the focus of Zircon). After a little bit of research it turned out that there are no text GUI libraries for Java which\nsupport what we wanted like extensibility, support for multiple GUI platforms (Swing, libGDX, etc), custom font support and such.\n\n### The main pain points in other libraries we wanted to work around\n\n- No dirty checking, everything is redrawn after a refresh\n- Deep integration into Java2D, no simple way to write a libGDX version\n- Not extensible, classes have no clear separation of concerns\n- Not themeable\n- No built-in fonts and no easy-to use way to add one\n- No CP437 tilesets (like the ones used for Dwarf Fortress)\n- No clean API\n- No support for loading `.ttf` files\n- Clunky components\n- No scrolling\n- No javadoc and no documentation\n- Does not work on Mac\n- No animations\n\n> (I have to commend Lanterna here. Its codebase is excellent and supports all kinds of fancy stuff but there was no way to\n> easily add libGDX support for it and it was also stuffed with terminal emulator stuff (which we don't want)).\n\nWith this new version we can now say that Zircon suffers from none of the problems mentioned above.\n\nHere is what we have achieved compared to the previous release:\n\n## Release notes\n\n> You can consult the [README](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/blob/master/README.md) or the\n> [Wiki](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/wiki) for details about each change.\n> This document is intended to be a brief summary of the highlights of this release.\n\n## API refactor\nThe project was refactored to an `api` and an `internal` package. From now on everything which is intended to\nbe user-facing can be found in the `api` package and everything else is considered to be private to Zircon.\nThis means that you can use anything from `api` and can only use stuff from `internal` at your own risk.\n\n**Note** that from now on you can rely on classes in the `api` package so your code won't break. This means that\nno method signatures will change (if the need arises new methods will be added) and the way they work will also not change.\n\n## Introducing `Behavior`s\nThe core components of Zircon have been refactored into `Behavior`s separating their concerns into meaningful parts:\n\n- The `Boundable` interface denotes something which has bounds in 2D space (all kinds of stuff from `Component`s to `TextImage`s)\n- `Clearable` is for stuff which can be reset to a default state (like a `Terminal`)\n- `CursorHandler` is for handling the cursor. `Screen` and `Terminal` are cursor handlers, but a `TextBox` is also one.\n- `Drawable` and `DrawSurface` are pairs. You can `draw` any `Drawable` (like a `TextImage`) onto a `DrawSurface` (like a `Terminal`)\n- `InputEmitter` is responsible for re-emitting GUI events transformed into an internal `Input` format from the underlying GUI layer (like Swing).\n- `Layerable` objects support adding `Layer`s to them. Imagine this as adding a plus dimension (depth), or Z-index to an otherwise 2D surface (`Terminal`)\n- `Positionable` objects can be positioned in 2D space. For example a `Layer` can be positioned over a `Terminal`\n- `Movable` is an extension of `Positionable`. It lets you move its implementors over surfaces like a `Terminal`\n\n## Animations\nZircon now supports `Animation`s. An `Animation` is basically a series of `AnimationFrame`s. Each frame consists of\na bunch of `Layer`s which are applied to a `Terminal` / `Screen`. You can use the `AnimationHandler` to run animations.\nThere is also a custom format for animations (`.zap`: Zircon Animation Package) which consists of a bunch of `.xp`\n(REXPaint) files and some metadata (`animation.yml`) which details things like the order of the frames, repetition\nand timing.\n\n## Builders\nNow every object which you can use in Zircon has either a `Builder` or a `Factory`.\nThis greatly enhances ease of use and also hides the internals of the library.\n\n## The component system\nA component system was introduced. Now you can put `Component`s on `Screen`s. These are the ones which are currently supported:\n\n- `Button`\n- `CheckBox`\n- `Header`\n- `Label`\n- `Panel`\n- `RadioButton` and `RadioButtonGroup`\n- `TextBox`\n\n`Component`s come in two forms: leaf objects (like a `Label`) and `Container`s (like a `Panel`). You can put `Component`s\nand `Container`s in `Container`s but you can't add children to `Component`s.\nThere is also a simple message passing solution which is used internally to communicate between components. You can expect\nall components mentioned above to work in a way which you might expect from them including focus handling. You can use\nthe `[Tab]` key to move the focus forward and the `[Shift]+[Tab]` key stroke to move backwards. Currently the traversal\norder is defined by the order which the `Component`s are added.\nAll `Component`s come with the corresponding `Builder` for your convenience.\n\n## ColorThemes\nNow you can use `ColorTheme`s to pimp up your `Component`s look and feel. Zircon comes with a bunch of built-in themes\nbut you can build your own. `ColorTheme`s are applied recursively to all child `Component`s starting from the one you\napplied the theme to.\n\n## Fonts\nFonts have been refactored to be able to support multiple GUI frameworks. Currently there is a Swing implementation but\nthere is also a libGDX prototype which works (it is not published yet, because it is being fleshed out).\nFonts also have multiple variants:\n\n- CP437 fonts are backed by a single `16x16` sprite sheet and support the CP437 characters\n- Physical fonts are backed by `.ttf` files\n- Graphical tilesets are backed by graphical tiles and they have their own format (currently just a `.zip` file with `.png` files and metadata)\n\n## Graphics\nThe graphics package was refactored. Now it consists of:\n\n- `Box`: represents a `TextImage` composed of box drawing characters\n- `Layer`: a specialized `TextImage` which can be used with `Layerable`s\n- `Shape`: an abstract representation of a shape (triangle, rectangle, etc) which consists of `Position`s only. Can be converted to a `TextImage`\n- `StyleSet`: value object which holds style information (background, foreground, modifiers).\n- `TextImage`: an in-memory representation of `TextCharacter`s. Can be `draw`n on `DrawSurface`s.\n\nAll of these come with the corresponding `Builder` to create them.\n\nShapes all have their own `*Factory` to create them: `FilledTriangleFactory`, `FilledRectangleFactory`, `LineFactory`, `RectangleFactory` and `TriangleFactory`.\n\n## Resources\nAll external resource handling (fonts, animations, etc) are now handled by the corresponding `*Resource` in the `resource` package:\n\n- `ColorThemeResource`: holds the built-in color themes. Technically not an external resource yet but will support loading themes from files later\n- `CP437TilesetResource`: contains built-in tilesets (mostly from the Dwarf Fortress tileset repository). Also supports loading your own CP437 tilesets\n- `GraphicTilesetResource`: can be used to load `.zip` files which contain graphic tilesets. There is an example tileset (extracted from Nethack) included. More will come later.\n- `PhysicalFontResource`: contains physical fonts (OSS fonts extracted from Google Fonts) in `.ttf` file format\n- `REXPaintResource`: can be used to load REXPaint files (`.xp`). Can be converted to Zircon `Layer`s.\n\n## Miscellaneous changes\n\n- All Swing-dependent operations were refactored in a way that now there are only 3 classes which can't be unit tested in headless mode.\n  This also means that the test coverage can be greatly improved (`83%` currently)\n- `Modifier`s were refactored. Now there is a `Modifier` interface and some built-in implementations of it. This means that you can create your own `Modifier`s\n- `TextGraphics` was completely removed. Now you can use individual factories to create `Shape`s\n- Implementation details were greatly simplified leading to the deletion of a lot of classes (like `ScreenBuffer`)\n- There were also re-namings in order to achieve more meaningful names (`TerminalSize` became `Size` for example)\n- The README was reworked and a Wiki was added\n- An `EventBus` was introduced internally for handling component changes\n- Fonts are now cached",

            "selftext": "*After years of downtime, it was just a few days ago that the new Java EE specification, Java EE 8, was released. Version 8 of the Java Enterprise standard was originally planned for the summer of this year, is much more than just technology. It is a commitment from Oracle to the Java Community Process.*\n\nBut it's worth waiting for. This proverb taken as a benchmark, the new version of the Java EE specification should not just be good but very good. More than four years have passed since the release of the predecessor and thus the still current version 7. If you now believe that Java EE 8 is riddled with countless innovations and enhancements, you may be disappointed. The coming version is rather an evolution than a revolution. Some even speak of a maintenance release on the way to Java EE 9. Nevertheless, this version is an important milestone for the future of Java EE. But always in order ...\n\n**Politics wherever you look**\n\nActually, everything started so nicely. After some disagreements had occurred with the specification of Java EE 7 and Oracle had to be accused of losing a little bit of the focus, one seemed to want to do better with Java EE 8. Already shortly after the final release of Java EE 7, a panel with the notable title \"Java EE - Meet the Spec Leads\" was held at the JavaOne Conference 2013, which discussed extensively the future orientation of Java EE.\n\nAll agreed that the community should play a greater role in determining the future direction in order to prevent late directional changes, as happened with Java EE 7. To ensure this, a second public survey was launched, involving around 5,000 interested parties. Part 1 of the survey, conducted in December 2013, looked at meaningful new APIs and a general assessment of hype issues such as NoSQL or HTML5. In January 2014, Cloud, Microservices, Security, Logging and Deployment were also discussed. The result at that time was clear. The community focused on \"lightweight\" and \"easy to use\". Cloud and co. New UI technologies seemed to be of lesser interest. API candidates such as JSON Binding, Java EE Configuration or JCache received a response of 60% to 80%. The same was true for focusing on an alignment of the use of CDI within the many existing Java EE APIs. Proposals for cloud-related topics, on the other hand, rarely exceeded 50%. The future roadmap of Java EE thus seemed clear.\n\n[Continue reading at the orignal article...](https://translate.google.com/translate?tl=en&u=https%3A%2F%2Fjaxenter.de%2Fjava-ee-8-62568)",
