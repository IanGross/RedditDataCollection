            "selftext": "Hello everyone!\n\nFor a little context, this a question that I've never been able to answer as a Vim user ~~how can I exit Vim?~~. When I first began working with it, I decided for NERDTree as it seemed the way to go. After some time, maybe years, I changed my mind and began using Tim Pope's vim-vinegar and netrw, but as it usually happens when programming, I need to keep a couple of files open at the same time, which made me work with windows, and slowly moved to tabs. Now, I'm thinking of moving to buffers and/or markers. \n\nMy best case scenario would be to have a circular list of (filename, line) with these operations:\n\na. Open a file next to the currently opened file (it doesn't matter at which line).\n\nb. Remove the current item from the circular list.\n\nc. Move to the next/prev item in the list.\n\nWhich almost leads to think about buffers, the problem is that, I usually work with big files, so I tend to open the same file in different tabs at different lines, which is a bummer and the reason I'll need markers. So here I am, asking for the best way to solve this little problem. A couple of solutions out of the top of my head:\n\n- Buffers. This one seemed nice at the beginning, the thing is that if open the same file at different buffers, I may have inconsistencies, right? Another problem is I'll have to figure out if I can open the buffer in the position that is after the active buffer.\n- Global markers. This my prefered one at the moment, I'll need to do some scripting to implement all the operations, evidently. Also I need to find out **how to programatically swap markers**.\n\nAnyway! If somebody has a better solution or can give me any advice on how to implement this, I'll be more than glad to read! And who knows, maybe this is the last time I have to think about this problem.\n\n**EDIT:** I ended writing a bit of code to keep a 2d array of [filename, line] and operators to move back, forward, close current and add current (the files are actually opened using netrw's `open` command). The current limitation is that I can only keep one circular list, but I don't think I'll need more than one. Thanks for all the advices!!!",

This is annoying because I have to undo them all before I start working.\n\nToday, I got pretty annoyed at this so I debugged it. I removed all of my plugins and left just my vimrc. Then, I commented out sections until the issue stopped. This led me to `set background=dark`. It seems that removing this line fixes the issue.\n\nEven after adding all of my plugins back in, the issue seems to be gone.\n\nI suspect this has something to do with how vim handles termcap. I'm not 100% sure but it seems like a terminal response is being interpreted as keyboard input?\n\nThis also might be related to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/4y8654/bug_starting_vim_while_holding_shift/) issue I reported a while ago.\n\nAnyone know what might be going on?

The machines are deployed based on tickets/story points and after we are done developing we give the environments to QA. I can't deploy/edit the project locally because it needs a special environment with lots of auxiliary services, which require very powerful machines.\n\nIn the past I used PHPStorm's ability to upload files on save and now I use sshfs to mount a directory locally but I really hate it because it's very sluggish (network latency is not the best). I've also tried vim's netrw plugin but then things like ctags, fzf & nerdtree don't work. I've also considered the idea of using inotifywait to get functionality similar to PHPStorm's upload on save and, although it's exactly the same functionality I had before, that does not take care of the the problem when files are created/updated on the remote machine (we have console commands for file creation helpers) and I can't install inotify-tools on the remote machine for the reverse because I don't have root access. Git is not a good solution either because I don't want to make tens of commits each time I edit a line trying to find what mistake I've made.\n\nHow do you guys handle these kind of situations? I've googled for solutions but it seems that either my googling skills are sub par or I'm looking for a solution for my problem in the wrong way.\n\ntl;dr I want to edit projects remotely and netrw, inotifywait, git and sshfs don't work for me.

In hopes of not doing something stupid, I ask the wisdom that /r/vim offers to steer me in the right direction.\n\nNaively, I think the following should do the trick.\n\n- Check my working`~/.vim` directory into source control (Pre build)\n- Pull my `~/.vim` directory onto the new machine \n- symlink `~/.vimrc` to `~/.vim/vimrc`\n\nThen the thought of dealing with pathogen plugins hit me. \n\n- Should I commit them to version control?\n- Should I build them individually? \n- Can I make a plugin dependency file similar to a `package.json` or `requirements.txt`?\n\nThese questions started overwhelming me and led me to ask \"What are the best practices when creating a vim build script?\".\n\nMany thanks in advance =)",

            "selftext": "The title is intentionally a bit provocative, but I actually find myself wondering about the \"true ultimate\" development setup which seems impossible without one or the other.\n\nSurely, the true \"vimmer\" way is to do as much from the keyboard as possible. I have keyboard shortcuts for almost each everyday task, I use vimium when browsing, I even use the universal [bash shortcuts](https://ss64.com/bash/syntax-keyboard.html) whenever I'm not in vim-supported typing environment, I use slate for switching between / moving windows.\n\n...As little as I try to rely on the touchpad, I would be helpless without it. There's always some piece of the interface in the OS that's either very hard to interact with from a keyboard or it simply is not supposed to be used from a keyboard. And even if you're some kind of OS guru that has everything configured to be done from the terminal or with the shortcuts, there's always at least some website that didn't account for accessibility properly and you just *have* to use the mouse cursor on it.\n\nI've had talks with vimmers who strongly claim that they *never* use the touchpad or mouse \u2014 but each one that I saw in person started using touchpad *almost the next moment*! Either to scroll something or to reach some interface item that's either hard to reach otherwise or he is just used to using the mouse on.\n\nSo eventually my question is not so much as \"how can you live without it\"... I'm actually thinking about my development setup. As I'm using an external monitor, I find that the screen of my laptop is almost useless \u2014 I don't use it at all. So obviously I'm thinking about obtaining a bluetooth keyboard and just putting the laptop aside. But then... do I get a mouse? Do I get an external touchpad? Is this something other developers commonly do? Having an external keyboard seems cool, but having to drag around a keyboard and a touchpad... Huh... I'm not sure I like this idea yet.\n\nAny thoughts?\n\nAlso, sorry if this is the wrong subreddit, but I feel like it's one where people will relate the most.",

I then open a tmux session on it and split it into two panes. In each pane, I open a different file with vim on the Debian box. My .vimrc has:\n\n    set clipboard=unnamed\n\nin it to paste to the system clipboard. I yank a line from File A in TMUX pane A. I type in :reg and see the yanked text in the \"\" register. Fine. I go to File B in TMUX pane B. I type in :reg and the yanked text is not in the \"\" register as expected.\n\nBut then if I quit File A and then quit File B and then open File A and then open File B and type in :reg in File B, I can now see the yanked text in the \"\" register!\n\nCan someone please let me know why the yanked text is not immediately available to File B after I do a yank?

For now, I'm just trying to get filetype detection to work, so I'm setting all `*.html` files, but I plan to change that later.\n\nI have a file, `~/.vim/filetype.vim`\n\n```\n    if exists(\"did_load_filetypes\")\n        finish\n    endif\n    augroup filetypedetect\n        au!

I've tried moving my vimrc in case some plugin was interfering (replaced with a vimrc containing only `filetype on`), but no dice.  `:filetype detect` always comes up with html.\n\nI'm hoping that there's something obvious I've missed.
