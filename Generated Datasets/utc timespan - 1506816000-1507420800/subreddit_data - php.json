            "selftext": "Hey, r/PHP.\n\nI'm willing to achieve modularity in the application my company is working on, so it can be shipped with different set of modules for different customers, e.g. customer1 wants the app with modules A, B, C, customer2 wants the app with modules A, C, D. Modules extend functionality of the application.\n\nI've defined the following criteria for such modularity system:\n\n- Modules do not interact with each other.\n- Modules depend on the main application.\n- Modules release cycles must be independent of the main application.\n\nEssentialy each module adds several routes/pages to the application, adds/removes tables in the database, creates files and directories, adds and removes cron jobs - to sum up, it does whatever it needs to work without affecting other modules.\n\nI thought about it and had an idea to organize this via composer. Is this a good idea? It seems good, because if I need to create application with modules, I can add them via composer like\n    composer require acme/my-module\nand the post install hook will run module installation script. I can also utilize pre-package-uninstall hook to \"clean up\" the app when module is removed.\n\nAnother benefit is that composer makes it easy to handle versioning.\n\n> So, question 1: do you think it's a good idea to organize modules via composer?\n\nAnd then I think about module development and I fail to understand one thing: since module is dependent on the main application (e.g. it uses entities/services/value objects of the main app), when I'm working on a module, should I add main application as dev dependency? So I can develop and run tests.\n\nE.g. app in its core contains \"Contractor\" entity. I create a module that provides \"PaymentService\" service and requires that \"Contractor\" entity in order to function. I guess, in module composer file I need to add main app as dependency, right?\n\n> Thus, question 2: when developing a module, is it okay to use main app as dev dependency?\n\nThanks everyone for any feedback and good luck!",

SO, hoping for some solutions to something I am sure people have maybe thought about before.\n\nHow do you test methods that do not return anything?\n\nExample, you have a method that given an array of data, saves it to a database via PDO.  So you do your query, use bind params:\n\n    $sql = 'INSERT INTO random_table (column1, column2, column3) VALUES (:param1, :param2:, :param3)';\n    $query = $this->database->prepare($sql);\n    $query->execute([\n    ':param1' => $data['param1'],\n    ':param2' => $data['param2'],\n    ':param3' => $data['param3']\n    ])\n\nNot perfect (just typed it out), but you get the idea.  \n\nSay I cock up, and I actually put  \"':param2' => $arr['param1']\", how do I test this function that given an array of data, that the array that is then used for the bind params is correct?\n\nThe only way I can think of doing it is either returning the bind params array (which seems pointless as in the actual code the return value won't be used), or checking the DB after the test (which goes again unit testing principle?).\n\nAnyway, I hope you understand what I am aiming to do.  Basically I made a booboo, and usually when I fix a bug I submit a test to prevent regressions.\n\nHow can I stop this happening again?",

            "selftext": "Hey, I've got to store millions of small images for a website.\n\nCurrently I'm just storing them in the filesystem (with directory sharding), it works well and is quick to be served by Apache, but backups are a pain, as most backup software is struggling to back them up (tried rdiff-backup, duplicity and rsnapshot, I'm resorting to rsync for now, others are too slow) and it's a pain to manage to know what space they are using exactly etc. This is currently handled on an Atom server, serving a few millions requests per day.\n\nWhat would be a low tech, zero cost solution? I thought about storing them in a database as blobs and have a filesystem-level cache but not sure if that would be much better. Stuff like MogileFS or other high tech stuff that requires a lot of admin time is not worth it, I don't want to spend much time caring about it. Also I don't want to use cloud based solutions as they are not software solutions and usually very expensive (my budget here is zero).\n\nAlso this is mostly an append-only solution, images are never deleted, unless there's exceptional circumstances. I thought about just appending data to blobs and storing somewhere the length and position in the blob of the file, and then serve that directly, seems like a very simple solution, until you need to delete an image. But in that case I could just overwrite the image with nul bytes in the blob. Also using a SQLite database for that would be interesting, and it seems to be quite fast: https://www.sqlite.org/intern-v-extern-blob.html\n\nThere might be ideas of specific filesystems too? Don't know much about that.\n\nAnyway, anyone with a good idea?",

Also, security is a thing.. I don't want to expose API endpoints for the world to see\n\n**Is MQTT the right thing to use for this? or are there any other simple message stores out there that I could use?**\n\nOr should I just suck it up and build a generic storage into my Laravel app to receive and expose this gathered instead of using a message broker?\n\nThanks!",
