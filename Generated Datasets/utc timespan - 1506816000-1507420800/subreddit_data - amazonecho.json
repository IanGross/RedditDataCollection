Is that correct, or did I miss something?\n\nAfter installing the app on my and my wife's phones it was able to see people to call and we tried it out a few time and it was fun. My question now though is when I am not at home, how can I use my app to call it? If I select my wifes name (the amazon account) will the call go to the dot or her phone app? \n\nWhat happens if we uninstall the app from her phone?\n\nIs there a place on the web I can go to better learn about this thing?

It is a sci-fi adventure/thriller set on a space station orbiting Jupiter's moon Europa. \n\nBefore we release the game, we would like to hear your thoughts, ideas and opinions on it. If you'd like to play Path of Discovery: Europa before its release, message us and we'll send you the download link!\n\nThe player navigates through the story in a classic Skill manner (verbal commands), but can also watch what's happening in the game on their device's screen. The game is fully voice-acted with accompanying music and sound effects.\n\nSince Echo Show isn't a household staple yet and there are (to our knowledge) no games made yet that take advantage of its screen, we don't want to release anything without checking in with the Show community first!\n\nWhatever you think of it, throw it our way! We have some experience making text-based adventures (the Lifeline: Whiteout series for mobile), but this is our first Skill, and we know that most of you understand the inner workings of Alexa devices better than us. We have full-faith that any feedback you give us will help us make the game infinitely better. We look forward to hearing from you! :)",

Can this just run on LocalHost or can this be made part of the Lambda function?\n\n3) How will the tray app be continuously be polling for new commands as I understand commands are pulled instead of pushed.\n\n4) I've only implemented 3rd party skills as an \"badge engineering\" project.

Here's the challenge: While US and Canadian numbers follow the same format and have unique area codes, Mexico does not. For example, I can call a number in the SF Bay area by asking for Alexa to call 415-xxx-xxxx, or a number in Newfoundland by asking for 709-xxx-xxxx, Canada and US both have the same country code (1). Mexico, however, has a different country code (52) and numbers in some areas don't follow the same format as the US and Canada. For example, the area code in Puerto Vallarta is 322. If I try to call a number there, I just get \"I can call numbers in your contacts or I can call numbers in US, Canada and Mexico\". I've tried with just the area code, with the country code, and various other combinations. No luck.\n\nAm I going to be forced to put any Mexican numbers in my contacts?",

Supports up to five different destinations, and gives you travel time (by car) in current traffic conditions (info from google maps/google directions.) \n\nIt also sends a map with your route on it. Seems to be much more accurate than the built in time which, for me, bears almost no relation to what google maps says.\n\nSupports the Echo Show. \n\nWould be grateful for good reviews and/or personal critical feedback",

But for some reason, when I go over to my Dot and ask it to play everywhere, it tells me that multiroom audio isn't set up yet. Bottom line is that it won't initiate multiroom audio from the Dot. Anyone else having this problem? I think I set it up properly and it clearly works when I request multiroom from the larger Echo.\n\n---- UPDATE ---\nSo I found out what was wrong. My router is 2.4/5.8 and apparently one Alexa device was connected to one, and the other was connected to the other. Although technically they were in the same subnet, I guess all Alexa devices need to be on the same SSID. After I changed one of the devices, multiroom seems to be working now.",

Set [device name or group name] to [color] and similar commands no longer worked with any color I tried with exception of \"indigo\". Other colors I tried that didn't work included red, orange, blue, green, turquoise, magenta, cyan, purple, violet, and more. For several days I though this was just a temporary issue with Amazon, but after 4 days I went back into history to review how Alexa was interpreting my requests and saw that before installing 4AFart - no problem, and after, only indigo. No idea why indigo - it may have been the last color selected before 4AFart was installed, which is why I tried that color early in my attempt to resolve the source of my issue.

On their show, \u201cThe Tick\u201d, the main villain, The Terror, has an Echo in his secret lair and, after capturing and tying up one of the heroes, tells Alexa to play ominous music. She replies, \u201cShuffling playlist of ominous music.\u201d\n\nI, of course, immediately asked one of my Echos to do the same. Sadly, she didn\u2019t know what I was talking about.
