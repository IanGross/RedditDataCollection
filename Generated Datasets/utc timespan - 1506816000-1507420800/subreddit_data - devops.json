The address subsequently will include a new path for the directory.\n\nSo it works when deployed to...http://host, but not with http://host/path, as all requests in the microservice gets routed by an NGINX reverse proxy.\n\nHow can I use an NGINX rewrite/redirect to append /path to the URL so that it can be served from the subdirectory, but NGINX will still know that the locations still exist at the root level?\n\n**My 301 Attempt**\n\n    location = / {\n      root /www/ng;\n      try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;\n      return 301 http://$host/pot;\n    }\n\nHere I did 301 redirect on the catch all location.

It's insane. Regression takes a month at least, so the company has been interested in automation. They have one guy who made a few functional UI tests for Android and they would like the running of these tests integrated into the current CI development process. That's where I come in.\n\nI have one Android device connected to a CentOS 7 server. Jenkins runs the gradle command which runs the tests on the device, and not very well. Of course the tests work for the dev who made them and they're all failing when I run them. And I'm remote so when something goes wrong with the device, I can't see what it is and I need to get someone in the office to assist. It's a sad little set up that can't possibly hope to scale to an extent that would save the manual testers any time. \n\nSo I've been looking into containers as a possible solution, but it doesn't look like there is a good solution for running functional UI tests for mobile devices within a container. Am I wrong? Does anyone have any other solutions? Right now I think my best option is the AWS device farm, but I think $250 a month is more money than my company is willing to spend on automation at this point since we only have a few tests. ",

In terms of operations, in addition to the ConnectWise suite, we have some cloud and IaaS offerings and a custom documentation system. \n\nMy Role: Automating as much of our business, operations, and support processes as possible. Mainly with our current platform, but also evaluating and testing other platforms to keep our business competitive and growing. \n\nRight Now:  I am involving the various departments in how our platform affects them, and what they need in terms of automation for their particular deliverables. Also, breaking down large scale processes into smaller, more maneagable ones. \n\n1st Goal: To migrate our server management processes to a micro-service style model. This is currently in process. \n\nQuestion: Where do we go from here? Management is very up on investing in us, so what technologies should we request training and/or certification in? How do I keep momentum going, and how can I keep the other parties interested as we go through the transformation?",

Because it seems like I have to setup at least part of my VPC architecture (everything that doesn\u2019t rely on actual instances) via Terraform, and then follow it with Packer to generate all of the necessary AMIs? Then following that I actually create all of the instances and finish up the creation of everything else?\n\nAfter that I could have my CI server create a new AMI each time code is going to be deployed, with updated dependencies and application code, and then let terraform handle the swapping of the blue and green groups.\n\nAm I missing something?
