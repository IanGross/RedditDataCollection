Crossposting here to hopefully get a wider audience and someone who can maybe see something stupid that I missed to help fix this.\n\nI'm having an issue with dynamic choices not working in a form I'm creating in flask/wtforms.  My forms now look like this:\n\n\tclass BoothLocationForm(FlaskForm):\n\t    booth_location = StringField('Booth Location')\n\t    timeslot = RadioField('Reserve this time', id='reserve_booth', coerce=int, choices = [('64', '15:00'), ('61', '17:00'), ('19', '19:00'), ('55', '21:00'), ('58', '23:00')])\n\n\n\tclass BoothDateForm(FlaskForm):\n\t    booth_date = StringField('Date')\n\t    booth_locations = FieldList(FormField(BoothLocationForm))\n\n\n\tclass MultiBoothDateForm(FlaskForm):\n\t    troop = SelectField('Troop Reserving', validators=[DataRequired()], id='select_troop', coerce=int)\n\t    booth_dates = FieldList(FormField(BoothDateForm))\n\nAnd my form template looks like this:\n\n\t<form method=\"POST\" action=\"{{ url_for('cookie_reserve_booth') }}\" name=\"reserve_booth_form\">\n\t\t{{ form.hidden_tag() }}\n\t\t<p>{{ form.troop.label }} : {{ form.troop }}</p>\n\t\t<table border=\"1\">\n\t\t\t{% for date in form.booth_dates %}\n\t\t\t<tr><td>{{ date.booth_date.label }} : {{ date.booth_date.data }}<td></tr>\n\t\t\t<tr><td>\n\t\t\t<table border=\"2\">\n\t\t\t\t{% for location in date.booth_locations %}\n\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t<td>{{ location.booth_location.data }}</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t{% for time in location.timeslot %}\n\t\t\t\t\t<td>{{ time }} {{ time.label }}</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t{% endfor %}\n\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t{% endfor %}\n\t\t\t</table>\n\t\t\t</td></tr>\n\t\t\t{% endfor %}\n\t\t</table>\n\t\t<button type=\"submit\">Reserve</button>\n\t</form>\n\nfinally - the route looks like this:\n\n    @app.route('/cookie_reserve_booth/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])\n    def cookie_reserve_booth():\n        start = datetime.strptime(\"2017-10-04\", \"%Y-%m-%d\")\n        end = start + timedelta(days=2)\n        booths = (CookieBooth.query.filter(CookieBooth.starttime >= start)\n                                   .filter(CookieBooth.endtime < end)\n                                   .order_by(CookieBooth.starttime))\n        dates = set()\n        locations = set()\n        for i in booths:\n            dates.add(i.starttime.date())\n        for i in booths:\n            locations.add(i.location.name)\n        dates = sorted(list(dates))\n        locations = sorted(list(locations))\n        form = MultiBoothDateForm()\n        form.troop.choices = current_user.get_troops()\n        for date in dates:\n            date_form = BoothDateForm()\n            date_form.booth_date.data = date.strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d\")\n            for location in locations:\n                # choices = [(b.id, b.starttime.strftime(\"%H:%M\")) for b in booths\n                #            if b.location.name == location and b.starttime.date() == date]\n                # choices = [('64', '15:00'), ('61', '17:00'), ('19', '19:00'), ('55', '21:00'), ('58', '23:00')]\n                location_form = BoothLocationForm()\n                location_form.booth_location = location\n                # location_form.timeslot.choices = choices\n                date_form.booth_locations.append_entry(location_form)\n            form.booth_dates.append_entry(date_form)\n        return render_template('cookie_reserve_booth.html', form=form)\n\nWhen everything is set up this way, it actually works.  But that has hard coded choices.  When I switch to the dynamic stuff - even the exact same hard coded choices list of tuples - added in the route, it fails.  The error I get is about NoneType not being iterable, meaning that the choices section is coming back null.  Any thoughts?  Or should this be a new topic/question?",

I did a few foundation courses, then Python specific courses, and then did Treehouse's Flask course with little personal projects sprinkled in along the way. \n\nMy question is in regards to front ends for a Flask/Bottle web apps. In the Treehouse tutorial they walked through some of it but it was mostly \"let's slightly  modify this template we already wrote most of off screen.\" I'm looking for any resources regarding generating (or using existing) front ends for Flask apps.\n\nMy current \"biggest project\" is a Kivy app the uses a Bottle site to communicate with a MySQL database and return JSON (both hosted on PythonAnywhere). If I could continue working with the PythonAnywhere ecosystem that would be ideal for now.\n\nHonestly I'm sure any front-end resources would help, the only reason I'm focusing on Flask and Bottle is that starting narrow and then branching out has worked for me so far.

I don\u2019t really understand how this is machine learning though? It ends up doing regression on a data set but doesn\u2019t predict anything, and definitely doesn\u2019t \u201clearn\u201d like the Google definition seems suggest. It makes you think that python machine learning means that it is going to take Data, like data on mortgages for example over the past 30 years, and predict what they will be over the next 30 years effortlessly and simply.But it seems like machine learning his muddled up with ubiquitous examples of regression and statistics over past series data in which you never really cover predictive modeling\u2026\n\n\nSo what exactly is machine learning in python?",

I can simply do:\n\n    plt.plot(x,y)\n\nbut this doesn't really represent how spectra works. Really, the stuff is binned, so the value y[i] is the total between x[i] and x[i+1]. The most accurate way to represent this data is with a flat line between each pair of x values, with a height of y. plt.hist has the looks, but it seems like it only works for a list of values. Does anyone know a matplotlib function or keyword argument for plt.plot that can allow me to make a plot like this?\n\n[Here](https://i1.wp.com/arxiver.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/stickleyetal-1606-06374_f3.jpg?w=259&h=244&crop&ssl=1) is an example",

Overall very promising. He asked a range of questions about basic python stuff, class inheritance stuff, python 2 vs. python 3, context managers and so forth. There will be a round 2 in my near future.\n\nHowever one deficit uncovered is my lack of big data experience. I have worked with thousands on lines of data, not millions. If hired, this company would have me work in big data applications. I need a crash course.\n\nPlease may I have some suggested reading and exercises from you guys? I have probably a few days to a week to dive in and get as much as I can. The interviewer also mentioned they use Hadoop. I'm not sure if that's even a python thing. Is there another platform of package I should familiarize myself with as well?\n\nAlso general interview advise also desired.  ",

What I need to be able to do is account for a search that will return multiple results. So I'm trying to figure out if I have to iterate through the search results in the function and return a tuple (or multiple tuples? A list of tuples?) that way, or if the iterating has to be done somewhere else. I thought this would work, but I was wrong:\n\n(searchtest.py):\n\n    ....\n    from somefolder import ad_operations\n\n    results = [(name, dept, info, title, error) for x in ad_operations.search_by_query('J*', 'noyoucantseemydomainusername', 'noyoucantseemydomainpassword')]\n\n\n\n Whichever way I arrive there, I just need some way of getting multiple search results from that function so I can list them on a webpage as individual items.",

As part of my program I'm looking to copy/paste a file into a directory on the network that is chosen by the user. This network path is basically a string and can't be found via os.path navigation, it\u2019s sitting on the network somewhere away from the application which is on the local machine. \n\nWhen I hardcode the path using something like\n\n    shutil.copy2(src,\\\\path\\to\\network)\n\nthe copy/paste works fine. However, whenever I try to introduce the path as a variable, I always run into leakages and other issues. This [post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2042342/how-to-copy-a-file-from-a-network-share-to-local-disk-with-variables) is basically exactly my issue, but I haven\u2019t found a solution that worked. Yes, adding r to the string makes it work, but how could I insert that r if the path is a variable that is user input?\n\nI have also tried\n\n    finalpath = \\\\path\\to\\network\n    finalpath = finalpath.encode()\n    finalpath = regex.escape(finalpath)\n\nAnd they also seem to always fail. Basically whenever I introduce the path as a variable right in that line it\u2019s going to cause leakage issues, regardless of how I manipulate the path afterwards. But then how can I use the string as a variable in my program? At the end of the day, all I\u2019m looking to do is copy/paste a file into a directory that is provided by the user. I assume this means I need to pass the path as a variable so it\u2019s defined and then use it in a function. If there is a way to introduce the variable within a function then maybe that\u2019s the solution? \n\nHopefully you guys can help me out! Thank you. \n",

Since I was already learning Python, it was given to me to do as an excuse to learn to code on company time (thanks, boss!).\n\nI have an idea about how I want to do it, but I'm not really sure where to start:\n\n- There will be a base text file that I will need to read. It's 2 columns, each has a header. Both columns will be important\n\n- It will need user input. A successful completion (correct user input matching against the file) will check the first 2 columns of user input, excluding headers, against the columns in the text file\n\n- The first column will not be uniform. Some (most) valid entries will be something like XY123456, and a few will be various-length strings, all starting with XY and ending in a 1 or 2\n\n- If any items are missing in the user input, the script/app will return what's missing\n\n- If there are extra items, the user should be alerted that those extra items are not needed\n\n- This will run at a central location, so I was thinking of using CherryPy to present just a text box for the user to paste into\n\n- Bonus: The entries are network devices, so if I can have the user select the platforms then I can add the devices in those platforms to a separate list that will get checked or not based on their input, that would be great.\n\nI'm not asking for y'all to do the work for me, I'm just looking for a little direction on where to start. Links, useful methods, useful libraries, etc. This will be my first project starting with a blank text editor, so I'm using this for my first real learning opportunity.\n\nANY help is appreciated.",

However, when i try it with a larger list i get the following error:\n\n    source = urllib.request.urlopen(url).read()\n      File \"C:\\Users\\RustyGun\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python36-32\\lib\\urllib\\request.py\", line 223, in \n    urlopen\n        return opener.open(url, data, timeout)\n      File \"C:\\Users\\RustyGun\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python36-32\\lib\\urllib\\request.py\", line 532, in open\n    response = meth(req, response)\n      File \"C:\\Users\\RustyGun\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python36-32\\lib\\urllib\\request.py\", line 642, in \n    http_response\n    'http', request, response, code, msg, hdrs)\n      File \"C:\\Users\\RustyGun\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python36-32\\lib\\urllib\\request.py\", line 570, in error\n    return self._call_chain(*args)\n      File \"C:\\Users\\RustyGun\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python36-32\\lib\\urllib\\request.py\", line 504, in \n    _call_chain\n    result = func(*args)\n      File \"C:\\Users\\RustyGun\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python36-32\\lib\\urllib\\request.py\", line 650, in \n    http_error_default\n        raise HTTPError(req.full_url, code, msg, hdrs, fp)\n    urllib.error.HTTPError: HTTP Error 999: Request denied\n\nSo i think this is basically telling me that i'm unable to get data for one of the pages in my list.  And I'm fine with that.  What i want to do is put my current code for getting this information in an if statement and catch this error.  Basically to ignore it and go onto the next url.\n\nHere is my code:\n    import bs4 as bs\n    import urllib.request\n    import csv\n\n    with open('domains1.csv') as f:   \n        urlList = list(f)\n        dataFull = \"\"\n        print(urlList)\n        for url in urlList:\n            source = urllib.request.urlopen(url).read()\n            soup = bs.BeautifulSoup(source,'lxml')\n            length = len(soup.text)\n            data = str((url + str(length) + \"\\n\"))\n            dataFull = (dataFull + data)\n    \n    appendFile = open('output.csv','w')\n    appendFile.write(dataFull)\n    appendFile.close()\n    print('finished')\n\n\nI have searched for Error 999 and haven't been able to find much to help me.\n\nThanks in advance! and again to sentdex!",

These pulses appear with a 10Hz frequency. I want to plot both these ACh pulses, that are going to appear every 0.1 sec, but I'm having a hard time because of the precision of python. \n\nTo ACh pulse is defined has a square function by saying that if t_init < t < (T + t_init), where t_init is the time when the pulse begins and T the duration of the pulse, ACh has its maximal value ACh_max. Otherwise it should be zero. What I do is to update the t_init every 0.1 sec for a new pulse to start.\n\nHere is my code:\n\n\n    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt \n    import numpy as np\n\n    start = 0 \n    end = 0.9 # s \n    steps = 600\n    t = np.linspace(start,end, steps)\n    t_init = 0.0 \n    T = 0.001 # s \n    ACh_max = 0.001 # M\n    i = 0\n    ACh = np.zeros(len(t))\n\n    while i < len(t) - 1:\n        if t[i] % 0.1 == 0:\n            t_init = t_init + 0.1\n\n        if  t_init <= t[i] <= (T+t_init):\n            ACh[i] = ACh_max\n        else:\n            ACh[i] = 0\n\n        i = i+1\n\nI can only have the first pulse.

            "selftext": "In a [recent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/746nt1/creating_a_chain_of_eversmaller_words_need_help/), I asked for help in understanding why a function of mine was not scanning through all possible pathways when creating a chain of ever-smaller words, each one being one letter removed from the last. For example, if you started with \"fine\", you could go \"fine, fine, in, I\", but the program wasn't seeing that possibility. It was only seeing \"fine, fie\", and stopping there because you can't form valid words by removing a letter from \"fie\". Anyways, u/sushibowl and u/kochuyt pointed out to me that my code could not possibly scan over all possibilities, so I went back to the drawing board, and at last, came up with this:\n\n    def checker(checklist,targetlist):\n        for i in checklist:\n            if i not in targetlist:\n                return False\n        return True\n\n    def chain_hunter(wordy,dicty):\n        if wordy not in dicty:\n            return False\n        goodlist = [wordy]\n        badlist = []\n        while True:\n            if goodlist == []:\n                return None\n            if dicty[goodlist[-1]] == ['']:\n                return goodlist\n            elif dicty[goodlist[-1]] == [] or checker(dicty[goodlist[-1]],badlist) == True:\n                badlist.append(goodlist[-1])\n                goodlist.remove(goodlist[-1])\n            else:\n                for word in dicty[goodlist[-1]]:\n                    if word not in badlist and word not in goodlist:\n                        goodlist.append(word)\n                        break\n\nThis creates a list of words and uses a kind of branching method to test the words at each step of the way. At every stage, it tests to see if the word has any 'child' words. If it does, it adds it to the list and goes down. If it does not, it takes it off the list and goes back. If a word has no children, it's added to badlist. If a word has children but all its children are on badlist, it is added to badlist. And so on. If a word has children all the way down to \"a\" or \"i\", it's a valid list and is returned as a result. If a word has no chain of children that make it that far, it is added to the badlist, and when the original word is on the badlist, the program recognizes the goodlist as empty and returns None, as in no full-length chains of words.\n\nAnyways, thank you for your assistance, and I hope this helps some of you!",

            "selftext": "Hey guys, I'm new to python and as a training exercise I decided to make a script that would get the mouse x-axis coordinate and plot it vs another variable (e.g. time). The problem I'm having is that I want to use it while playing a game and this game has the peculiarity that the cursor is always in the middle of the screen (like any FPS). So the x coordinate that I get is always the same! and so I get a plot with a straight line (of markers because it's a scatter plot). When I try it on the desktop it works quite well.\n\nSo, I'm wondering if there is a way of \"ignoring\" the ingame \"coordinate system\" and use the global position on screen? I can't even find the words to ask it properly :P\n\nI've tried with the game fullscreen and windowed mode, but it's the same.\n\nAnyways, thanks in advance.\n\nEdit: I'm still trying to find a better way of explaining my issue. Let's see: If I have the game in windowed mode and I center that window in the center of the screen which has a resolution of 1680 pixels wide, when I run the script I get the value 1680/2=840. Then I move my mouse left and right and the value doesn't change, because for the game, the cursor is always in the center, like with any FPS that you look arround moving the mouse but the crosshair is in the middle always.",

Currently this is what I have:\n\n    class Node:\n        def __init__(self, func):\n            self._func = func\n            self.deps = []\n            self.completed = False\n            self.return_val = None\n\n        @property\n        def deps_met(self):\n            return all(node.completed for node in self.deps)\n\n        def add_deps(self, deps):\n            for node in deps:\n                self.deps.append(node)\n        \n        def run(self):\n            if not self.deps_met:\n                self.run_deps()\n            self.return_val = self._func(*[node.return_val for node in self.deps])\n        \n        def run_deps(self):\n            for node in self.deps:\n                node.run()\n            for node in self.deps:\n                node.join()      \n\n        def join(self):\n            while not self.completed:\n                pass\n\n\n    node1 = Node(lambda result2, result3: None)\n    # ...\n    node7 = Node(lambda: None)\n\n    node1.add_deps([node2, node3])\n    # ...\n    node5.add_deps([node6, node7])\n\n    node1.run()\n\n\n1) The problem is that I'm unsure of the best way to parallelize the runs, since I want to be able to have the option to either run the graph sequentially or in parallel. Also I'd rather not have subprocesses forking subprocesses and would like them all to run forked off of the main processes.\n    a) would it possibly make sense to add the node to a task queue for it to be gathered by a listener and farmed out?\n\n2) Am I trying to do too much in the Node class? Would it make sense to break this up into smaller classes anywhere.\n\n3) Is there a need for an encompassing Graph class? Or should the root node be the definition of the graph?\n\nThanks.",

            "selftext": "I'm working through Allen Downey's [\"Think Python\"](http://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/) (highly recommended), and I've got to an exercise that asks you to find the longest possible chain of valid English words with the following properties:\n \n* each word in the chain is formed by removing one letter from the previous word, leaving all the other letters in place\n* the chain must go all the way down to a one letter word (meaning either 'a' or 'I')\n\nNow, my code (running Python 3.5.3 on Ubuntu MATE 17.04 using Geany 1.29) works beautifully most of the time, and gave me the following longest chain:\n\n    'complecting', 'completing', 'competing', 'compting', 'comping', 'coping', 'oping', 'ping', 'pig', 'pi', 'i'\n\nNot bad, huh? But on certain words, it says that there isn't a fully valid chain when I know there is. For instance, if you start with 'fine', you can go `'fine', 'fin', 'in', 'i'` but my code isn't detecting that as a possibility.\n\nIn my code, I start with a list of all English words from the [Moby Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moby_Project):\n\n    fin = open('words.txt')\n\nThen I create a dictionary of all the words, to make it easier to search.\n\n    def file_to_dict(filer):\n        worddict = {}\n        for line in filer:\n            word = line.strip()\n            worddict[word] = True\n        return worddict\n   \n    wordso = file_to_dict(fin)\n\nThen, because the list does not have single-letter words in it, I add them, along with a blank entry.\n\n    wordso['a'] = True\n    wordso['i'] = True\n    wordso[''] = True \n\nThen I create a dictionary of 'child words': for every word in English, I attach a list of all valid words that have one letter removed from the original.\n\n    def child_dict_maker(dicty):\n        child_dicty = {}\n        for word in dicty:\n            child_dicty[word] = []\n            for i in range(len(word)):\n                wrd = str(word[:i] + word[i+1:])\n                if wrd in dicty:\n                   child_dicty[word].append(wrd)\n        return child_dicty\n    \n    x = child_dict_maker(wordso)\n\nNow, it's time to make a chain, and for that I have this function (with some `print` functions inserted into it in an attempt to figure out where things are going wrong). Notice that it takes a list as input. To work properly, I insert an empty list in the beginning, and the recursive function fills it up with words.\n\n    def prints_in_succession(wordy,listy,dicty):\n        print(wordy)\n        if len(wordy) == 0:\n            return listy\n        elif dicty[wordy] == []:\n            return False\n        else:\n            listy.append(wordy)\n            for word in dicty[wordy]:\n                return prints_in_succession(word,listy,dicty)\n\nHere's the code I used to find the longest list:\n\n    title = ''\n    title_list = []\n    for entry in x:\n            if prints_in_succession(entry,[],x) != False:\n                listy = prints_in_succession(entry,[],x)\n                if len(listy) > len(title_list):\n                    title = entry\n                    title_list = listy\n    \n    print(title,title_list)\n\nRunning that code gave me the 'complecting' list you see above. But when I try running this code:\n\n    print(prints_in_succession('fine',[],x))\n\nI get this:\n\n    fine\n    fie\n    False\n\nI don't understand why my code fails on \"fine\". And to be honest, I don't understand why it succeeds on so many other words. When I put in \"fines\", it gives me `'fines', 'fins', 'ins', 'is', 'i'`, no problems. How does it know how to test all the possibilities there, but not know how to deal with \"fine\" and \"pine\"?\n\nAnyway, there's my problem.\n\nEDIT: Solved!

            "selftext": "Evening r/LearnPython\n\nThe reason for this post is because I'm having trouble with *List Indexing*.\n\n For some background of what i am trying to accomplish in my code: I am creating a script that will essentially help me study for up and coming exams by the process of \"practice problem repetition.\" I input the chapter(s) i want to study, then input the practice problem PER chapter id like to practice, and it should randomly choose a chapter along with a problem in that chapter. \n\nI'll go ahead and just post the code snippet of which I need assistance with in order to not bombarded you with my spaghetti code.\n\nIf you would like some further context of my code, [HERE](https://pastebin.com/bAABgHsp) ya go.\n\nNonetheless, code snippet:\n    \n    import random\n    \n    usersChapters = [3.0, 3.2, 3.3]\n    usersProblems = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 200, 5, 6, 7, 400, 8, 9, 10, 11, 600]\n    #Note           |X|    3.0    |XXXX|   3.2  |XXXX|     3.3     |XXXX|\n    \n    \n    def fullRandomization():\n        randChapter = random.choice(usersChapters)\n        \n        i = 0\n        z = 1\n    \n        beginIndex = 0\n    \n        while True:\n            if randChapter == usersChapters[i]:\n                beginIndex = usersProblems.index(i * 200)\n                secondIndex = usersProblems.index(z * 200)\n                randProblem = random.choice(usersProblems[usersProblems.index(beginIndex)+1:usersProblems.index(secondIndex)])\n                break\n            else:\n                i += 1\n                z += 1\n    \n        print('\\nDo problem #{} from chapter {}. Gook Luck! :)'.format(randProblem, randChapter))\n    \n    fullRandomization()\n\n\nAs you can see by the *#NOTE* comment in my snippet, I'm using iteration multiplied by 200 as my list splicing. This is because i didn't know how else to go about categorizing certain chapter with their own individual problems. I considered dictionaries, but just didn't see it working. However, deep inside I'm sure there is a more effective ways of going about what i am attempting to do, but at the moment being, i just couldn't think of any. Any hints as to what those more effective methods might be would help a bunch. Anyhow, my provisional list splicing method, for the most part, seems to work as intended.........up until chapter 3.3 is the selected randomly generated chapter. In the snippet above, selected problems for chapters 3.0 and 3.2 work fine. When it comes down to chapter 3.3 being selected, i get \"ValueError: 14 is not in list\".\n\nWhy exactly is this?\n\nMakes absolutely no sense to me as in when i input \"error check code\" such as; `print(usersProblems[14])` OR `print(usersProblems.index(600))`, i get *600* and *14*, which tells me the index very well does exist.\n\nAnyways, hope i was clear enough. Any comments/suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance and good day. Cheers! :)",

            "selftext": "Hi pythonistas,\n\nI'm getting stuck at putting together a bunch of scripts into larger programs.\n\nI'd like to describe the program I want to do and hopefully I can receive some good advice on how to do it and also what concepts etc. I need to learn from here. \n I've actually made an attempt at this program but it's a mess and I feel it could be better designed.\nThe program control's 1-4 synchronized camera's and a GPS system and monitor's things in real time. It's for taking photos on the move e.g. from a moving car.\n The GUI will be a small box on a PC screen, but if any abnormalities are detected the user is alerted and they can inspect further by pressing a button to open a detailed window e.g. to view more stats, or a map. \n It links together several scripts as kind of 'modules' that are all monitored by a master script.\n\nEach script/module works on it's own and is written in python 2.7. (I guess I could update to 3.x if I really had to). The challenge is to have them working together.\n\nThe modules:\nCameras:\n - control multiple synchronized camera's by controlling a command line program using win32com.\nPhoto's:\n - do checks e.g. that all camera's did take a photo at one (no missing frames/misfires).\n -  real time summary statistics\nPhoto thumbnails are displayed\nGPS:\n - monitor GPS data string through a com port in real time.\n - show when connected/disconnected.\n - monitor and show stats e.g. health of signal, number of satellites.\n - Can display a satellite position plot.\n\nMap\n - shows path traveled.\n - shows points where photo's were taken.\n  - photo points a colour coded: green for ok, yellow for possible problem and needs checking, red for confirmed problem photo.\n - photo points can be selected to inspect the photo stats and to open the full size photo. \nWhen a photo is taken, it will be geotagged using the data from the GPS feed.\n\nFTP\nLogin window to connect.\nFTP connection to the GPS data box to monitor some additional data files.\nMonitor FTP connection and alert if connection fails.\n\n\nThe GUI is written with Tkinter. The GUI code is all mixed up with the other code but I've realised that I need to separate it out. I'm finding it pretty challenging to do that but I guess once I do I could then learn to make a GUI with pyQT and swap that in.\n\nEverything became complicated when I discovered the GIL and my app froze.\n\nMy setup now is to have all the 'modules' running in threads and each function is sent to a queue (the 'Queue' package), and processes them in order. But it's getting messy and I'm not sure if this is the write way to go!\nIn the queue i have some master functions, for example the \"check photo's\" and it runs every 1/4 second. If it actually detects to photo's, it adds to the queue the functions to check those photos.\nBut then what if I lose the FTP connection and want to connect again? This can take a few seconds and I have a loading bar to show the process. Should every increment of the loading bar be sent to the queue? or a different thread or something?\nAnd then if I have a map open at the same time and it's updating to show my travel path and new photo locations in real time. Is every update of the map to be added to the queue as well?\nSee, now I have all these things adding to the queue and I feel like it's a total mess.\n\nIf someone could even concisely summarize what I'm asking here that would be great.\n\n** Second part of the question!\nI understand GUI's as being 'event driven'. So if I click on the 'display map' button, that is the event which calls the function to display the map in a new window.\nBut my program also has functions running in the background and I want the GUI to react to them. For example, if the camera mis-fires, the 'camera warning' button will flash red so that I know to check that camera/photo stats.  This seems to me like the opposite to an event driven GUI. What's it called?\nAnd related to this - the code that does 'make button flash red if a photo is missing'... should that be in the camera class, or the GUI class or a combination of both?\n\nThanks everyone, hope I was able to make some sense here.",

Include in your loop a variable to count the months and a variable to accumulate the total interest paid over the life of the loan. See the sample runs below.  Notice that the payment plan works only if the first month\u2019s interest is less than the monthly payment. Your program must check for this condition and display the message \u201cLoan not approved\u201d in this circumstance without doing any further computation. Also, notice the last month\u2019s payment may be less than the monthly payment amount. Be careful not to over pay.\"\n\nSo im not looking for the answer here. I'll take whatever help i can get. I do want to learn how to do this but im just all out of ideas so i need a few suggestions.\n\nHere is my code:\n    principal = float(input(\"Principal-------- \"))\n    annual_interest = float(input(\"Annual Interest-- \"))\n    monthly_payment = float(input(\"Monthly Payment-- \"))\n    interest_month = (annual_interest/12)/100\n    months = 0\n    actual_payment = 0\n    interest_total = 0\n    total_payment = 0\n\n    while total_payment<=principal:\n    months= months + 1\n    interest_calc = interest_month*monthly_payment\n    interest_total= interest_calc+interest_total\n    actual_payment= monthly_payment-interest_calc\n    total_payment = actual_payment+total_payment\n   \n\n    print()\n    print(interest_total)\n    print(months)\n\nAnyway, not sure whats happenin!\n",

            "selftext": "So, I've been learning Python in my free time because there's some personal projects I have that it's a good fit for. Mostly, it's been fine to work with, but there's one particular aspect of the language I run into a lot that I'm confounded by. It's not actually one of its features, but rather a convention that the Python community seems to have settled on. The preference for defining functions at the module level strikes me as an antipattern in a language like Python, because it seems like it asks you to predict the future. I'm not sure why the community strongly encourages this; I feel like I must be missing something.\n\nI'm talking about the opinion expressed in [this Stack Overflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/18262662) or [this venerable old blog post](https://tomayko.com/blog/2004/the-static-method-thing). The basic idea is that you should define functions \"freely\" at the module level unless you have a particular reason to put them in a class, like that there's a group of functions that all handle the same data or whatever. The argument for this seems to be that it's better then putting everything in classes even if they don't need to be, like you would in Java. Comparisons are frequently made to Java-style static methods, which produce clunky syntax to emulate in Python.  Instead, people say that because a Python module creates an isolated namespace, you don't have to worry about polluting the global scope, so there's no problem.\n\nAt the moment you define the function in question, this all makes sense to me.  The issue is when the future comes. I think it's very difficult\u2014impossible, even\u2014to know in advance with absolute certainty that a function that seems appropriate to define at the module level won't morph into a function that obviously belongs in a class. If that does happen, you'll be forced to change the interface of the module to put that function in a class, meaning that all the code that depends on that module will also have to change. This is bad.  Instead, you could just put that function in a class to begin with, heading this problem off at the pass, but apparently that's not Pythonic.\n\nHere's an example from that blog post \"The Static Method Thing\" I linked to above. I know this is a 13-year-old example, but as far as I can tell this perspective is still basically current in the Python community (please correct me if I'm wrong about that). Tomayko gives the following example of idiomatic Python code, within a hypothetical module called `X.py`, as an alternative to putting this code in a class like you would in Java:\n\n    message = \"Hello\"\n    def say_hello():\n      print message\n\nThis is great if all you want to do is say hello as it's defined in the module.  What if you want to say hello in different languages? Easy enough, just get rid of the module-level variable and make the function take an argument instead:\n\n    def say_hello(greeting=\"Hello\"):\n\nSo far so good\u2014existing callers of this function don't need to change. Perhaps we'd like to be able to say goodbye as well:\n\n    def say_hello(greeting=\"Hello\"):\n      print greeting\n\n    def say_goodbye(farewell=\"Goodbye\"):\n      print farewell\n\nNow, there's something a bit less than ideal about this code. We made these functions more flexible to allow hellos and goodbyes to be said in different languages, but the functions themselves know nothing about this. Instead, the knowledge of what the correct greetings and farewells for different languages are is maybe strewn all over the rest of our program. That might be fine if the program is small, but it may well become clunky if these functions start getting widely used throughout the rest of the code. So eventually we may want to change their design:\n\n    def say_hello(language):\n      print language.greeting\n\n    def say_goodbye(language):\n      print language.farewell\n\nNow they take a `language` object with `greeting` and `farewell` attributes.  This allows us to consolidate information about appropriate greetings and farewells in our program, simplifying code that depends on this information.  This redesign does force dependent code to change, but the change makes the design of the program cleaner, so it's arguably worth it.\n\nThis code might be good enough for the time being. But as work goes on, that might change. Maybe what we're using this code for is to simulate humans talking to each other, and each human needs to speak a certain language. We may start adding many functions like the above that output different phrases depending on the desired language.\n\nThe more functions we add like this, the clunkier the resulting code that uses them becomes. The reason for this is the need to track the specific language that's appropriate for each call of these functions. We can't define the language at the module level, because there are different humans being simulated in the program and they don't all speak the same language. But trying to keep track of the appropriate language in an ad-hoc way throughout the rest of the program is going to get messy. This is a great opportunity to define a class:\n\n    class Human:\n        def __init__(self, language):\n            self.language = language\n\n        def say_hello(self):\n          print self.language.greeting\n\n        def say_goodbye(self):\n          print self.language.farewell\n\n        #...\n\nNow all the code that depends on this has to change again, and this time pretty significantly. If we have a large codebase making frequent use of this code, we've made a lot of work for ourselves. If we had put these functions in a class to begin with, we might eventually have to change the class's name, but that change would be far less drastic, probably even automatable. So why not put it in a class to begin with? The Pythonic approach seems to be to wait until you really need the class to write one. But by the time you know you need a class, that change might be really painful, whereas starting with a class is pretty easy and gives you a lot more room to adapt to change.\n\nIn my experience, this sort of thing happens in real code all the time. I have a much stronger background in Ruby, and back when I was a novice developer I went through the progression I just described many times in Ruby. Frequently, I would start off writing something I thought was going to be small, one-off script, so I would write the code imperatively, with top-level functions and no classes.  Inevitably the program would start getting larger than I anticipated, and it would become clear that I needed to put some of the functions inside of classes or I would have to start repeating myself. As a beginner, sometimes I would copy and paste code for a while, and create a horrible mess for myself quickly that defining classes was the most obvious escape from. As I got more experienced, I started defining classes right from the get-go, and incurred less pain as a result. This latter approach is typical in the Ruby community. Even though Ruby is also multi-paradigm, Rubyists tend to put the vast majority of their code into classes, which makes more intuitive sense to me than the approach I see in the Python world.\n\nOne thing I sometimes see people say is that you should prefer truly stateless, pure functions in Python. The problem I see with this is that Python has no mechanism for enforcing purity. Sure, you can define a function that looks pure, but without being able to verify that everything it calls is also pure, looks can be deceiving. Verifying this by hand is frequently impractical. Luckily for people who favor functional programming, it's possible to verify this automatically, but Python doesn't work that way. If you want to do pure functional programming, I think a language like Haskell would be a far better choice. In my opinion, trusting the illusion of purity is far more dangerous than acknowledging that your code is impure and designing to compensate. Due to Python's design, I would never trust that a given function that was anything beyond trivial was genuinely pure. So if I'm going to write Python code, I'd rather just embrace its impurity, since you get nice things out of mutable state you might as well take advantage of.\n\nWhat am I missing? Obviously Python is a popular language and the issue I'm describing must come up on the regular. Is there a nice way for dealing with it that I just don't know yet? Am I wildly confused about Pythonic best practices?  I feel like I'm describing a relatively basic code design issue but when I've looked up information on it all I've found is stuff like the links I posted above. Experienced Pythonistas, how do you slice this appple? If you define a module-level function and later need to move it into a class, do you have a way of doing it without significant pain?",

I've noticed that in those situations, Homebrew and MacPorts usually have the same software I need in their repositories (i.e. a kind volunteer for those projects has gone through the effort of figuring out how to get that software to compile on Mac).\n\nAll the guidance I've read STRONGLY discourages mixing conda with Homebrew or MacPorts, and I can see why that makes good general advice.\n\nThat said, are there situations where resorting to Homebrew to install a one-off lib is acceptable, and doesn't necessarily risk breaking everything?

Here's my code:\n\n    from threading import Thread\n    from sched import scheduler\n    import time\n\n    def run_cycle(schedul):\n        while True:\n            schedul.run(blocking = False)\n            time.sleep(0.2)\n\n    scheds = []\n    for i in range(1000):\n        scheds.append(scheduler(time.time, time.sleep))\n        Thread(target=run_cycle, args=\n    (scheds[-1],)).start()\n\n    def add_task(schedul, when, task, args):\n        schedul.enterabs(when, 1, task, argument=(*args,))\n\n(On my configuration this code throws error approximately at i~650).\n\nQuestion: How can I overcome this limitation on number of threads? Or maybe there exists better realization of this?",

After I complete a challenge, I like to look up other solutions online to try and understand what others have come up with and their thought process/tools from python they used to best the challenge to possibly incorporate or learn other methods to solve problems.\n\n[Link to HackerRank problem.](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/array-left-rotation/problem)\n\nLeft Rotation Problem Description:\n\n> Given an array of size N and a number d, rotate the array to the left by d\n\n> i.e. shift the array elements to the left by d.\n\n> Ex: The array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] after rotating by 2 gives [3, 4, 5, 1, 2].\n\nI did end up completing the challenge, however, I came across another posted solution on [github](https://github.com/ehouarn-perret/EhouarnPerret.Python.HackerRank/blob/master/2%20-%20Data%20Structures/1%20-%20Arrays/4%20-%20Array%20Left%20Rotation.py) that boggles my mind and I can't figure out for the life of my how one line (3) works:\n\n    N, d = map(int, input().split())\n    a = list(input().split())\n    r = a[d % N : N] + a[0 : d % N]\n    print(*r, sep=\" \")\n\nLines 1, 2 and 4 - no problem definitely understand those.\n\nLine 3 though, confuses the hell out of me, from researching on python.org, I understand the ``` : ``` is for type annotations, but I cannot wrap my head around what this line is doing.\n\nIn the python interpreter if I do:\n\n    >>> type(a), type(d), type(N)\n    (<class 'list'>, <class 'int'>, <class 'int'>)\n    >>> type(a[d % N : N])\n    <class 'list'>\n    >>> type(a[d % N])\n    <class 'int'>\n    >>> type(a[4])\n    <class 'int'>\n    >>> type(a[0 : d % N])\n    <class 'list'>\n    >>> type(a[d % N])\n    <class 'int'>\n\nFrom what I can deduce, the ``` : ``` is causing the returned value to retain the type of ```a``` (list).\n\nLine 3 from above has the format ```a[d % N : N]```, but line 9 from above has ```a[0 : d % N]```.\n\nI haven't come across ``` : ``` in python code before, is this use of ``` : ``` becoming common now? I am guessing this is a new implementation from the standard lib typing from Python 3.5, or from some additions/extensions to typing in Python 3.6 (I am running Python 3.6.2).\n\nCould anyone kindly explain the use of ``` : ``` in Python 3.6.2 for me? Not only in the contexts from above, but I would also appreciate other use cases for ``` : ```. Is this usage pythonic (to me it makes readability hard - but maybe that is because I don't currently understand ``` : ```)? Is this a tool I can keep in my back pocket for other programs I write, or is it recommended to avoid this type of syntax/usage?\n\nThank you!",

Whenever I do 'for line in x', line is getting only one digit at the time, so toSum[1] wouldn't exist because there's no separation to be done.

I've got something usable running on a single PI, but I was now thinking about adding some kind of dashboard on a central server.\n\nSo I was plannign to (even if that's a bit silly) run a web-browser on the PI which opens the cam and stream the video using WebRTC to a remote server. The remote server could then do all the image processing, motion detection & co.\n\nThis is currently only a week-end playground project, mostly intended to *learn* stuff. My first aim was to learn OpenCV, which is going along quite well. But now for the meat of this post:\n\nI also want to learn about Python solutions for a stack which is able to handle multiple *incoming* streams in parallel. Maybe aiohttp? Maybe something else? Or... maybe stick with flask if it can do everything I need?!?\n\nI know I can spin up an apache server with multiple processes and threads for WSGI apps. But if I also want to spin up worker threads which do some of the heavy lifting of the image processing, or messaging aside from the main web-threads, I am a bit inexperienced. Especially, in the context of flask, how and *when* is it appropriate to run those threads. *Especially* when running behind apache using multiple processes.\n\nI do have *some* experience with multi-threading, so I am aware of the pitfalls and difficulties.\n\nI know there are alternatives to flask & httpd out there, but I have no *practical* experience with them.\n\nI was also planning to learn kubernetes along the way. I could imagine an architecture which uses kubernetes for scalability, but then the applications should be somewhat aimed at this kind of architecture.\n\n**So, with all that said: What are good stacks for this kind of applications if I want to stick with Python?**",
