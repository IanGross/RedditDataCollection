            "selftext": "Hello all,\nI have a rather unique issue I'm facing, and I hope this is the right place to ask for some suggestions.\n*Background: I am working on a program for my military unit. The program allows a member to set up their own schedule of events for a total of four weeks. My counterpart and I have set up a \"menu\" of sorts to give each member an idea of what there is to choose from as well as the ability to add events to this menu. At the end of the four weeks we collect feedback from them in the form of a 1-5 rating for each event that was in their schedule. We are currently using airtable.com as our organization program to keep things tidy. Once the schedules are created, we export them as .csv files to be used in excel.\n\n*Goal: Collect ratings from everybody to give a better idea to the next round of participants of what events were worthwhile, and which events were not. Ideally to create a Top 5 events and Bottom 5 based on the 1-5 ratings collected from everybody.\n\n*Issue: Collecting the 1-5 rating for each item is tedious and has up to this point been done in excel to keep track of the responses, average ratings, etc. because the schedule is exported as .csv. Excel is incredibly cumbersome for someone like me that doesn't have much background using it. Is there an app/program/whatever that I can use (thinking along the lines of yelp) that would allow me to collect ratings from the participants and then rank those events based on the overall response?\nAgain, if this isn't the right place for this question and you know where it would be better suited, please let me know so I can move it there. Thanks in advance!\n\n\nEdit: formatting",
