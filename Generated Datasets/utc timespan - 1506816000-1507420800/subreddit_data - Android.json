            "selftext": "So, new pixels were released and around now is the time when most who need a new phone are going to buy one, whichever phone it is.\n\nI've been browsing this sub for some weeks now and have seen nothing but just hate(and almost all of it is valid) for the new Pixel devices(especially after the announcement) but when buying a new phone, I think what you should look for is whether or not that certain criticism affects your usage in anyway.\n\nTwo of most disliked things in the new pixel devices were the headphone jack and bezels and this was very valid criticism. But when choosing YOUR phone, you have to ask, is that something that really affects you? If not, then there's no point in rejecting a phone just because most people don't like it and if it does affect you, there's no point in buying such a device. So, before choosing a device which you want to buy, I'd recommend making a list of things that you are looking for in a phone(for example, bootloader unlocking, stock android, developer support, headphone jack, small/no bezels, etc) and then checking how a phone performs in the each area.\n\nI currently own a Nexus 5X and an Xperia Z3(which I want to replace) and the things most important to me in a phone is how developer friendly the phone, or rather the OEM is. While the software nexus and pixels come with are nice to have, I do consider google apps as bloat or at least not very privacy friendly and want to run my phone on pure AOSP or some other custom ROM without gapps. And that's why I went with the Pixel 2 because google releases the device trees and kernel source which is very helpful in testing my own ROM or features I add to a ROM. As much fun as it is, bringing up trees and sources for an unsupported device from scratch is, it can often be a pain in the ass. So, while having no headphone jack and large bezels suck, I had to go with a phone which was best in the area that was important to ME.\n\nAs I mentioned, I've been seeing a lot of comments both for and against pixel(mostly against), it can be very confusing for someone who is buying a new phone. Therefore, when you are in a process of choosing a phone, don't dismiss any choice just because most people don't like XYZ feature in the device. Ask yourself if that feature even matters to you. If headphone jack is important to someone, they should definitely NOT consider pixel and maybe go with S8 or V30 or something else.\n\nThis post isn't meant to hate on anyone's opinion because I can understand most of the criticism and even I do not like many things in the new pixel devices but I think in the end you have to see if the goods that are important to you outweigh the bad.\n\nThis post might come as Google fanboy or Pixel fanboy post but that was not my intention. I dislike a lot of things in Pixel 2 as well and I love a lot of things in S8, Nokia 8, LG V30 and other new flagships. Sure, not having IP68 rated phone and headphone jack after owing a Z3 sucks and bezels, micro SD card and wireless charging never really mattered to me but Pixel 2 is still the best in the area that's important to me which is developer support. Hopefully this helps some people who are confused(like I was) when choosing a new phone.\n",

Huawei usb c cables will not charge nor detect my phone. I initially thought my port is faulty, but Samsung cables work, no problem. Seems the manufacturers are trying to create a problem, then give us a solution. Quality of most usb c cables is very questionable. We even have a Googler testing cables because if this. \n\n2. All this push by manufacturers to get rid of headphone jacks because of usb c. It gives them a convinient excuse on why they are purging the most universal type connector available. Couple this with rumours of DRM content, I start having a headache.\n\n3. Availability and pricing. Every one has a damn usb type b cable. Usb c? Better make sure your phone is hitting the higher battery percent before leaving home. My work around is buying a shit tonne of this cables. One in my car, one in my laptop bag, two in the house, one at my parents house, one at work. And they are not cheap!\n\nThe future is bright, but very expensive. Sad, folks",

I feel like there is more functionality with the Google Calendar app, but with Samsung, it is beautiful to view (it combines with my phone's theme) AND it is more intuitive (if I am in month view, I click on a day, and it shows a more beautiful window to scroll day by day where with Google, it becomes this messy long list of stuff).\n\nIn general, I love Google Calendar because I follow several calendars, share one with my husband, and if I am interested in an event on Facebook, it automatically saves on my calendar (which makes my overall calendar look like I have more exciting things to go to if I felt like it). I love that when I make appointments, I will easily search for the location, and it will remind me when I need to leave the house (in additional to custom email and notification reminders when the days get close)\n\nWhat I'm REALLY asking is, MANY of my girl friends, love using their fancy expensive planners and it has stickers, designs, quotes on every page. It really makes it look fun to use their calendar. Whereas I feel like although mine wins as far as functionality, how can it be better?\n\nAlso I love that if I remember to put someone's birthday into my phonebook, it will automatically show up on my calendar year to year.\n\n\nI'm asking for:\n\n-Any interesting apps that support google calendar?\n\n-How can I make google calendar even better? Maybe following a certain calendar?\n\n-My samsung calendar shows the weather, but it only works randomly. Any fun little widgets like the weather that can be incorporated into calendars?",

            "selftext": "*Before I start, I want to make a disclaimer that barring official word from Google, this is all speculation but is based on interpreting the information we do see. I would love to have more official input from Googlers about this issue.*\n\n\nI think one of the major stumbling blocks with Android, especially as it relates to non-phone branches is the lack of sufficient dogfooding (the internal use of whatever software/hardware to vet it prior to release to the public). \nIn order to have people dogfood a product, they must be *forced* to use it in their daily work/life so they can see the shortcomings of the product and give appropriate feedback to the developers. Google has very disparate teams on many different products from software developers to customer service representatives. They all should be able to be utilized for giving feedback on dogfooded products. The biggest importance of dogfooding is to expose your product to people outside of the team working on it to get outside feedback without needing to rely on the general consumer to 'beta test' the product. \n\n\nWhile several Google products seem to be very widely used (Gmail, Maps, Search, etc etc) amongst everyone in general including Googlers, I get the sense that things like Android Wear, or Android Tablets, Android TV, Android Auto are not widely dogfooded to Google employees. Also added to this are the new Google hardware offerings like the Pixelbook or Pixel phones likely aren't widely dogfooded due to concerns for 'leaks'. While there is some logic to this, we all know that information is leaked anyway and I think that the concerns for leaks do not make up for the surfeit in dogfooding. Furthermore, other tech companies such as Apple and Samsung manage to keep leaks to a minimum despite pretty widespread dogfooding by employees (from what we've heard). \n\n\nI believe that if large numbers of Googlers were forced to use things like Android Wear or the new hardware offerings in their daily work/life routine for a few months, you would have pretty strong feedback on things like the headphone jack on the Pixel phones or how to best utilize wearable tech or even how to fix messaging. If your own employees don't absolutely want to use your product whenever they can, how can you expect the public to? This seems to be the biggest issue with Google's latest product releases over the past few years. I expect if Googlers all got together to ask for the best Android tablet or watch or phone and were forced to use it, not only would they demand better tablet or wear apps from the rest of the company but they would be able to give feedback on what can really set Google's products apart and be the best for the consumer.\n\n\nAnyway, apologies for the wall of text. \n\n**Best TL;DR**: Googlers all over need to use their products so Google can make better products in general.\n\n",

            "selftext": "#Background\n\nFour years ago I bought my first ever smartphone, the Nexus 5.  I loved that little guy.  It could browse reddit, watch YouTube, take pictures, play pretty much any game I could throw at it.  Like I said in the title, I'm a casual user.  After four good years, however, the little phone that could, could do no more.  So I began my search for my next phone.  I had three requirements.  First, I knew I wanted Android.  Even though I'm not a power-user, I am teach savvy enough to want to be able to customize my phone.  Whether it's just the using my own keyboard, launcher, or being able to force security updates and new OS version on it, I knew I had to stick with Android.  Secondly, I wanted a flagship.  Clearly I don't cycle my phone every year like some people do, so I wanted a phone that I could buy today and use for several years with no issues.  Lastly, I wanted a fucking headphone jack.  Below are one man's impressions after two weeks of use.\n\n#The Physical Phone - 4/10\n\n**First Impressions**\n\nFirst thing you notice when you take it out of the box is how damn pretty it is!  This thing is absolutely gorgeous!  It's clean, it's sleek, it's shiney, and made of all glass.  All.  Glass.  The second thing you notice when taking it out of the box is how damn slippery it is.  Seriously, I almost dropped it three or four times just taking off the clear peel.  Even if I hadn't read the [reviews](https://www.cnet.com/news/samsung-galaxy-s8-drop-test/) about the [exceptionally fragile glass](http://bgr.com/2017/04/24/galaxy-s8-drop-test-video-squaretrade/), I knew immediately I'd need a case.  I tried both the [RhinoShield CrashGuard](https://rhinoshield.io/products/samsung-galaxy-s8-bumper-case?variant=32455065537) and the [Spigen Liquid Air Armor](https://www.spigen.com/products/galaxy-s8-case-liquid-air), and I ended up using the Spigen.  I think the RhinoShield would provide better fall protection from significant heights, I don't plan on ever being at a significant height.  I'm mostly worried about <5' drops; pocket slips, out of car, off desk, etc.  I was also concerned about the RhinoShield's fit.  The sides of the CrashGuard were loose.  I know this is a byproduct of the S8's curved edge, but the flex made me uncomfortable when holding the phone.  I was also concerned about dust and debris getting in between the bumper and the phone and scratching the already delicate glass surface.  Lastly, I found the side buttons easier to distinguish on the Spigen.  This is important to help me avoid the god-awful...\n\n**The Bixby Button**\n\nMaybe it's because I'm not a power user, but I hate this button. And I say this after having re-mapped it three different times with [bxActions](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jamworks.bxactions&hl=en).  It's just at no point in the past two weeks have I ever found myself in a situation where I've been thankful for the extra .375 seconds of time that the button granted me instead of having to say, \"Hello Google\" or press an icon on my launch screen.  I'm sure some people get a ton of use out of it, I just don't. The only thing it's ever done for me is frustrate me when I accidentilly hit it instead of Volume Down when watching Netflix or YouTube.  Not that I often finding myself wanting to turn the phone down when binging, since the..\n\n**Speaker**\n\n..is so shit.  Seriously, who thought a mono-downward facing speaker was a good idea?  When I hold my phone in landscape mode, I interlace my fingers behind the phone and the sides (i.e. top/bottom) touch my palms.  This covers the speaker essentially putting the phone on mute.  If I pretend I'm shooting a commercial and hold it with just my fingertips, the experience is still awful as either my left or right ear gets to enjoy the audio, but not both.  This awful speaker makes me happy that I made sure I got a phone with a...\n\n**3.5mm Headphone Jack**\n\nBut even this could use some work.  The jack is on the bottom on the phone, so when I put the phone in my pocket I put it head-down so the cord comes straight out of my pocket.  The problem with this is now the volume buttons are an extra five inches deeper into my pocket and so I have to put my whole hand into my pocket to change the volume.   A minor annoyance, I agree, but an annoyance nonetheless.  It makes me almost want to go to wireless headphones.  But I won't let them take away my 3.5mm jack!\n\nI'm sure a lot of you are wondering why I'm so adament about watching videos on the phone itself.  Well, it's simply because...\n\n**The Screen**\n\n...is so god-damned beautiful!  Seriously, Samsung, bravo!  The whites are white, the blacks are *pitch* black!  I change TVs less than I change phones, so my TV is old as balls and only supports 720p.  This phone is hands down the best screen in my house, and I love how everything looks on it!  I can't help but to prefer to watch Netflix on it than on my TV, or even my Nexus 9.  It's just wonderful!  I showed my girlfriend reddit sync while in AMOLED mode the other night with the lights off, and she said it looked like the words were just floating in the air.  It's brilliant!  In fact, with the recent news about the iPhone 8 sticking with LCD and only the 10 getting anything better, even some of my Apple fanboy co-workers are considering switching to this or to the Pixel 2.  \n\n**The Fingerprint Reader**\n\nObviously, this is my first phone with a fingerprint sensor, so all I can say is that it works for me.  I trained it for multiple fingers on both hands, at multiple angles, and it seems to always be able to read my fingers.\n\nAt first it was a bit hard to find the sensor by touch alone, but the Spigen case solved that problem thanks to the small divit that it now lives in.  I personally don't find it that hard to reach, but the S8+'s reader would have been almost useless to me based on the few minutes I played with it in-store.  My only major gripe about the placement on the S8, is that it's really close to the lens of the camera, and I'm constantly worried about scratching it.\n\nMy absolute favorite feature with the fingerprint reader is its integration with LastPass.  On the Nexus 5, it was so annoying to have to type in my 16+ character password just to open LastPass to find my other convoluted passwords.  Fingerprint authentication is the shit!\n\n**The Camera**\n\nIt's a camera.  It's better than my old one.  There will be hundreds of people who can give you a better review of the camera than I can.  My girlfriend and I went to the symphony and doing nothing more than opening the camera app, zooming in, and clicking I got [this picture](https://i.imgur.com/qNQw3Sq.jpg) from [this far away](https://i.imgur.com/UFByH4H.jpg).  I'll tell you what, though, the camera does have built in filters.  Which means now I'm an [artist](https://i.imgur.com/AFTfuND.jpg)!.  (/s)\n\n\n#Using the Phone, aka, the Software - 9/10\n\n**Samsung's Android**\n\nGoing from Vanilla Android on my Nexus 5, I was worried about getting Samsung and having to deal with all of their \"versions\" of Google's apps.  I bought the phone unlocked, so I didn't have to worry about and third-party bloatware.  Not to belabor the point, but I'm a casual user.  I don't need 150 features in my SMS messenger, or in my dialer, etc.  Luckily, Samsung's apps are pretty straightforward.  I still use gMail for my mail, and Google Photos for photos, but Samsung's apps aren't that much different that I felt I needed to change.  \n\nUsing this phone is a breeze.  All the settings are where I'd expect them, the few that I had a hard time finding were easily located with Samsung's cool search feature.  I'm psyched!\n\n**Performance**\n\nI'm not going to go into all the specs about what is powering this phone, that's for other reviewers to talk about.  I don't know what processor is in it or how much RAM or any of that.  What I *do* know is that this phone is **fast**!  I don't know if the phone really is as fast as it seems, or if I'm biased coming form an old 4-year-old phone, but this thing is **FAST**!  Every app I throw at it, it works seamlessly.  Going from one app to another and back, no problems! Web pages load fast, games load fast, everything closes fast, it starts up fast!  It's just a fast, fast phone, no other way to put it.  I'm very happy with the internals because I can see this phone, from a software perspective, lasting me for many years to come.\n\n\n**Battery Life**\n\nIt gets me through the day, with enough leftover for the night.  Yesterday we had a massive system outage at work, and so my day consisted of a pretty-much all day Netflix binge and when I got home, I still had 30+% battery left.  The thing charges quickly (corded, I don't have the wireless charging pad), and within an hour was at 80%+.  If this thing doesn't get you through the day, then I'd *love* to know what you're throwing at it.\n\n**Cool Extras**\n\nThe iris scanner is also wicked fast and, since it's IR based, it even unlocked my phone with my eyes in the dark.  Needless to say, I was impressed.  Another big thumbs up from me to Samsung on this front.\n\nOne thing that Samsung does provide is the \"Edge Drawer\" which lets you have edge-versions of some apps, or your calendar, or other neat shortcuts available with a swipe from the edge of the phone.  I disabled it.  Nothing particularly wrong with it, I just didn't find it useful.\n\nIf I had to have a drawback, it's that some of Samsung's apps don't update themselves, or I accidentally turned them off.  I don't want to have to worry about two different app stores.  If it's not in the Play Store, I'm not using it.  I'm not creating a Samsung account too.  \n\n#Overall Impression, 7.5/10\n\nA very, very solid phone.  The software and Android are great, no issues there.  If you tossed all of that into a phone that I wasn't scored to set down on any elevated surface, we'd be golden.  But that's not the case.  Instead, after dropping (heh) $750 on the phone, I'm expected to go and spend another $25-50 to buy a case so I don't have to treat it with kid gloves.  Makes me upset. Plus, the weakness of the glass has me worried about the longevity of the phone.  With the Nexus 5, twice I was able to tear it down and re-build it by myself with nothing more than $15 worth of parts and tools from Amazon.  Thanks to the glass, that most likely [won't be the case](https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Samsung+Galaxy+S8+Teardown/87136) with this phone.\n\nThere are also a handful of quirks about the design that irk me.  I hate the Bixby button, the speaker is awful, and I am not satisfied with the location of the headphone jack.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I do like this phone, I just don't *love* it.  I *loved* my Nexus 5.  The S8 is just good.  It's what I expected given the price.  But I'm not blown away.  There are very few things about this phone that make me go \"man, I'm glad I got **this** phone.\"  Other phones run Android.  Other phones have similar performance, and other phones have good screens (not as good as this one, mind you, but better than what I had been used to).  It gets even tougher to answer, Especially seeing as how annoying it is to use headphones with this phone.  It's to the point where I am seriously considering wireless headphones.  Which means I could have waited for the Pixel 2, or even tried LG's flagships.  For better or worse, I'm going on vacation next week and so waiting wasn't an option. My girlfriend and I want to take photos, and my Nexus 5, and her iPhone 6, just weren't going to cut it.\n\n\nWould I buy it again?  That's actually tough to answer, but I would say \"yes.\" Even though I'm *considering* trying wireless headphones, doesn't mean I'm ready to abandon the 3.5 mm jack.  It plugs into my girlfriend's car (which doesn't have Bluetooth), my outdoor speaker, etc.  As much as the physical designs of other flagships might make me happier, the lack of a headphone jack would be too much for me.",

When you can get a macbook or windows laptop for similar price and more functionality.\n\nIt made me think; Maybe we shouldn't be comparing the Pixelbook to other laptops.  Maybe we should pit it against the iPad pro 12.9 inch + Smart keyboard.  With Android apps seeming to be on the precipice of becoming viable in chrome OS, it'll make the pixelbook feel like a tablet with a keyboard. I have a Samsung Chromebook Pro. Love it. I've pretty much ditched my Nvidia shield and clunker old stalwart nexus 10 tablet for the chromebook pro.\n\nNow the Ipad Pro 12.9 64GB($799) and smart keyboard($159) you pretty much get the same amount of functionality.

            "selftext": "With the Pixel announcement I have personally decided that my OP5 is the best phone for me currently. I came from a Nexus 6p and when the OP5 launched I grabbed one and have used it as my daily driver. I wanted to wait for the Pixel but my Nexus had the infamous battery issues and I had a echo issue when talking on it. Couldn't wait but thought I could always sell on Swappa if the Pixel was that much better.\n\nI see a lot of hate for the OP5 and after using one for several months I font understand it at all. Granted, I haven't dealt with their customer service but that has nothing to do with the phone's ability to be my daily driver.\n\nSo the OnePlus 5:\n\n5.5' AMOLED 1080p - Coming from a QHD screen, can't tell the difference\n\nSD 835 - Best Currently available\n\nAdreno 540 - Best currently available \n\n8 GB Ram - Absolutely ridiculous \n\nUFS 2.1 - Best currently available\n\nDual 16 MP, f/1.7, 24mm, EIS (gyro) + 20 MP, f/2.6, 36mm, phase detection autofocus, 1.6x optical zoom, dual-LED flash\n\nBluetooth 5.0\n\n3300 mAh battery with Dash Charge - 7hrs SOT with 0 to 100% charging in an hour. Fastest charging phone in the market I believe.\n\nNotification slider - Should be standard across Android.\n\nUSB-C 2.0\n\nSuper fast fingerprint sensor\n\nUnlockable bootloader\n\nFlourishing development scene\n\n$540 for 128GB\n\nAnd.....\n\nHeadphone jack!!!\n\nSo do I want to spend $960 to gain dual front firing speakers, a better screen and IP67 but lose the headphone jack, lose the notification slider, cut my ram in half, lose dash charge and rely on a Google battery which they have the worst track record on.\nNo, I don't. \nIn fact, what phone with 128GB currently out has top of the line specs and a headphone jack with a AMOLED screen for under $550? Its insane how people overlook this incredible phone. It may not be the best looking but it has what I need to be a great daily driver. \n\n",

It is truly fantastic and an amazing competitor to the S8 and Pixel 2 (for a fraction of the price)\n\n...and you can't really see it in the screenshot, but the curved corners really complement the minimalist aesthetic I was aiming for on its 18:9 screen!\n\nEdit: The clock/weather widget is Transparent Weather Clock",

Standards are good, and it took years of fighting mini-ports and proprietary nonsense before we got something so consistent as the 3.5mm jack. Removing it without a reliable replacement feels like all of that progress is being erased.\n\nThat said, the comments I see in defense of keeping it are usually for use cases that would be easily replicated with Bluetooth (often inexpensively), and would add more features or convenience. In my own daily music listening experiences, I can't remember the last time I've used the jack. My house has become saturated with different pairs of Bluetooth headphones for different occasions, I've had various Bluetooth adapters in my car since as early as 2011, and listening through speakers at home and work is dominated by either Bluetooth speakers or casting devices. \n\nThe only recent time I found it inconvenient was when a friend wanted to play his playlist from his iPhone 7 on a party bus for a wedding, but the bus only had an aux port.\n\nFor those that would need to fundamentally change their routines without a headphone jack on their phone, what are some of those things?\n\nEdit: Lots of people mentioning using Bluetooth in the car so I'm linking this here for anyone that's trying to either find a solution for wireless music in cars with just aux ports or just learn about it. Seems like a lot of people don't know these even exist. It's in stock now.

            "selftext": "PCWorld recently published an article titled \u201c[How Google is using the Pixel 2 and Oreo to take Android back from its partners!](https://www.pcworld.com/article/3230509/android/how-google-is-using-the-pixel-2-and-oreo-to-take-android-back-from-its-partners.html#tk.rss_all).\u201d While Google does have to fight for a slice of the Android pie, its strategy with their Pixel line is not that one-dimensional. In fact, I believe their core strategy is to take market share away from Apple.\n\nOne of the most curious things about the Pixel 2 line is the design difference between the two models. With the smaller Pixel, Google keeps the design mostly unchanged from the previous model, which was already clearly an iPhone knockoff. I believe this is purposeful; this model in particular is not targeted at the general Android user, as it clearly cannot compete with the likes of the Galaxy S8 or other bezel-less phones in terms of design. Rather, it is aimed at converting iPhone users who are used to this familiar design language.\n\nWith the Pixel 2 XL, Google sets their sights on the potential iPhone 8+ or X user. I\u2019d describe the Pixel 2 XL as a happy medium between the 8+ and X, and the device itself is a bet against the features that Apple introduced in their new generation of phones. The iPhone X will introduce Face ID, but it remains to be seen how it will fare in real world usage (they already had a gaffe during its launch event) compared to the fingerprint scanner, of which Google claims to have the fastest. The Pixel 2 XL\u2019s bezel-less design gives it an edge over the iPhone 8+, and while it has a slightly worse screen-to-body ratio than the X, it does not have the controversial notch at the top of the screen.\n\nIn comparison to the 7/7+, the only real design change with the 8/8+ is the full glass body to support wireless charging. The fact that Google did not introduce this to their Pixel line implies that they don't think the average consumer wants or needs it. The Qi wireless charging standard is still quite slow and causes devices to get pretty hot \u2013 is this something anyone would practically use if they could get 7 hours of battery life from a 15 minute charge via fast charging as Google claims? They are betting that consumers would rather have a device more robust against drops. The fact that Apple failed to make significant innovations from the 7/7+ to 8/8+ provides a great entry point and opportunity to capture customers who would have otherwise blindly upgraded to the next generation of iPhones.\n\nAnd while the Pixel 2 XL is a big upgrade from the iPhone 8+ from a design perspective, it fails to amaze in comparison to many other Android devices on the market. It has a worse screen-to-body ratio than nearly all flagship phones released in 2017 and has infamously done away with the headphone jack, which Google mocked Apple for just a year ago. This, combined with the other subtle digs that Google made at Apple during both the original Pixel and Pixel 2 launch events, elucidates their strategy of targeting potential iPhone converts.\n\nFurthermore, reactions to the Pixel 2 launch were mixed among Android enthusiasts, and I think Google expected this to be the case. Google understands that their core fan base appreciates, above all else, the fully stock Android experience and its seamless integration with its many software offerings. Their challenge is not proving to Android users that they offer the best Android experience; rather it is proving to iPhone users the benefits and ease of switching to the Android ecosystem.",

It's still too cumbersome to reach them: you have to go to the Google app, ignore all those news articles you're not really interested in and click the \"Upcoming\" button... and you're never sure if you're gonna find anything in there anyways, it's mostly just the weather, and a traffic update even if you don't own a car or use public transport.\n\nThen I saw the new feature of the Pixels where it inconspicuously displays what song is playing at the moment on the bottom of the always-on display. It's a cute touch, but it's too special a treatment for an ultimately niche feature. What if that area was not used just for song identification, but as a permanent notification area for whatever's the most pertinent/urgent Google Now/Assistant card is at the moment? Where you parked your car, if your flight is delayed, if your package is shipped... the usual stuff, but now it's not bothersome to reach, but not in your way either. Double tapping would take you directly to the \"Upcoming\" tab (or whatever). It could default to weather when there isn't any other urgent info, or it could just be black... \n\nI think (something like) this could be a much more seamless experience than what we have now.

            "selftext": "TL;DR - Google, and Android OEM's as a whole, are failing in the small (and even mid-size) phone market. [I've said it once](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/6wreql/i_want_a_45_pixel_xs/), I'll say it again: I am begging Google for a 4.5\" Pixel XS... at the very least, a sexy 5\" Pixel. Just last year Apple released the shocklingly small 4\" iPhone SE and even their main iPhone 8 is smaller than the smallest mainstream Android Flagship. Today's technology should allow us bigger screens in smaller bodies, yet none are to be found.\n\n----\n\nIn the past 24 hours I have canceled my Pixel 2 XL order *twice*. Why? It's not really because of the cost. It's definitely not about the removal of the headphone jack, lack of wireless charging, insufficient waterproofing, remaining bezels, or any of the other hardware shortcomings.\n\nI can't follow through with this purchase for 1 major reason: **size**.\n\nLast year, many people, including myself, applauded Google's decision to release two phones with nearly identical features and specifications yet varying screen sizes. I felt comfortable buying the 5\" Pixel last year because I knew I wasn't getting the crappier of the two options; in fact, I upgraded from the Nexus 5X in large part for the 0.2\" reduction in size!\n\nDespite Google's jab at Apple this year, it's clear Google is shifting their focus exclusively towards the larger device.\n\n\nI have average (perhaps slightly stubby) sized fingers and I just can't seem to rationalize buying a phone the size of the 2XL, Note 8, V30, or even the S8 or G6 for that matter.\n\n----\n\nLet's compare the sizes of popular phones in 2017. Courtesy of [PhoneArena.com's size comparison tool](https://www.phonearena.com/phones/size):\n\n* [Google's 2016 and 2017 devices](https://i.imgur.com/K5WFYmq.png)\n* [Apple's 2016 and 2017 devices](https://i.imgur.com/Tuk0Lzc.png)\n* [A selection of smartphone flagships](https://i.imgur.com/CDt6dM9.png)\n\n-\n\nDevice|Release Date|Height|Width|Thicness|Screen \"Size\"|\n:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|\nPixel 2 XL|2017-10-04|157.90|76.70|7.90|6.0|\nPixel 2|2017-10-04|145.70|69.70|7.80|5.0|\nPixel 1 XL|2016-10-04|154.72|75.74|8.60|5.5|\nPixel 1|2016-10-04|143.84|69.54|8.58|5.0|\niPhone 8 Plus|2017*-09-22|158.40|78.10|7.50|5.5|\niPhone 8|2017*-09-22|138.40|67.30|7.30|4.7|\niPhone X|2017*-09-22|143.60|70.90|7.70|5.8|\niPhone SE|2016-03-21|123.80|58.60|7.60|4.0|\nGalaxy S8+|2017-04-21|159.50|73.40|8.10|6.2|\nGalaxy S8|2017-04-21|148.90|68.10|8.00|5.8|\nNote 8|2017-09-15|162.50|74.80|8.60|6.3|\nLG V30|2017-10-05|151.70|75.40|7.39|6.0|\nLG G6|2017-02-26|142.50|69.30|8.10|5.7|\nOnePlus 5|2017-06-20|154.20|74.10|7.25|5.5|\nHTC U11|2017-05-16|153.90|75.90|7.90|5.5\u200b|\n\n----\n\nWidth is the primary measurement of concern to me here, although height is also obviously important for thumb-reach. While the iPhone SE is the oldest device here, it's by *far* the smallest. Every once in a while I find occasion to hold my spare 5-year-old iPhone 5; I absolutely love the way I can easily hold the phone with confidence and reach every corner of the screen with ease.\n\nWhile Apple may never release a refreshed SE, **the regular iPhone sizes are still smaller than even the smallest respectable Android flagship.**\n\n----\n\nI would pay flagship prices for a hold-able flagship Pixel. If Google released a $850 5\" Pixel 2 with the same design as it's larger brother, I would seriously be tempted. If you take older, smaller phones and apply today's bezel-less design, you could easily fit a respectable sized screen into a 4-4.5\" phone.\n\nFor somebody so interested in smartphones, I actually prefer a desktop experience. My use-case for my phone is on the go; I want to be able to walk down the street, my phone in one hand, and not have to worry about dropping my phone. I want to be able to quickly whip my phone out of my pocket and use one hand to reach every corner of the screen.\n\nI can't be alone in this desire. I know people [want big phones, and they sell like crazy](https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-iphone-6-sales-back-up-demand-for-bigger-phones/). Still, some market must exist for flagships smaller than 5 inches!\n\nI'm primarily directing this complaint towards Google. I know about the Sony Xperia Compact phones*.\n\nThoughts?",

I could not believe how much bloatware that Verizon forces upon you and most seems to be useless.  It was so bad that I assumed that all galaxies were like that, which made me want to try the pixel 2 XL instead.  So I did some research and read about unlocked phones, and all I can say is wow what a difference.  So if you are new to Android phones, I find it highly worthwhile to shell out the cash up front, if the bloatware really annoys you like it did me, to buy the unlocked phone (I understand it's a lot of cash) because it is 100% worth it.

This happened a few weeks after my son threw the phone on the ground which smashed the screen, so maybe something came loose?\n\nI had decided a while back that I would be going with Nokia if HTC dropped the headphone jack on their next flagship, and it looks like they did with the HTC U11. I bought the Nokia for the equivalent of about $520 (I'm in Nigeria). It's the TA-1004 which is the dual-sim variant.\n\nThe Nokia 8 is an excellent device. It's nice to finally have a full stock Android option that isn't the Nexus (no microSD slot) or Pixel (no microSD, and now no headphone jack). Sadly, I am unable to change the system font since there's no root access at the moment and no available option for this in stock Android.\n\nThe software is very responsive with no lag, and the screen is gorgeous. I'd say it's the best LCD screen I've seen on a phone. I'm not really much of a phone camera enthusiast since I believe you should use a proper camera if you'd like to take stunning pictures, but the photos I've taken so far look pretty sharp and decent enough, and they're better than the photos I've taken with the HTC 10 which is adequate for me.\n\nFor folks concerned about bezels, the top and bottom bezels are pretty huge. They're almost double the bezels of the HTC 10. While I don't mind this at all, it's probably a dealbreaker for some people.\n\nI haven't had a chance to test the battery life yet, so I can't comment on that, but ultimately, I'd say I'm very satisfied with my purchase.\n\nSample photos: https://imgur.com/a/Js3xW\n\nBattery stats on LTE all day: https://imgur.com/a/78ysa\n\n\nEDIT: Updated with battery stats and sample photos.",

Some interesting arguments ensue, and while I get off a lot of good \"Android is better at x\" comments, they get off a equal amount of things that Android did wrong. However, a lot of the things that \"Android does wrong\", such as software updates, security, ease of use, optimization, etc, is getting better but is definitely improved with the Pixel. I think we can all agree, bezels/jacks/whatever aside, Pixels are buttery smooth, stable, fast, secure, and the best experience of Android you can get. Not to mention Google has promised three years of updates, which is a welcome change.\n\nThat being said, one of the criticisms of Android is it's lack of good \"extensions\" such as wear, auto, TV, etc. I've had several Android Wear watches and personally believe the Hauwei watch is the best, but it's not a Pixel watch. Google could do a lot with a pixel watch. Build pixel-specific features like they did with the Pixel buds, optimize it, etc. As for Android TV, the 'google' Android TV is the old Nexus player, which by some miracle google is still updating despite its age. I have a Nexus player and a 2017 Shield. Both are great, and the shield is arguably the best Android TV. But again, as google has proven by following apples design hardware and software together strategy, a \"pixel tv\" could potentially fix a lot of things wrong with Android TV.\n\nI believe google missed a pretty big chance here, and while their new product lineup is great, they could have done to tv and especially wear what they did to the phone space, set a example and show how it is supposed to be.

Settings that should require the device to be unlocked include: do not disturb, hotspot, mobile data, wifi and bluetooth.\n\nAlmost all thieves know that the first thing to do after stealing a phone is turning on airplane mode.\n\nIf someone wants to prank you or has other bad intentions they could easily:\n\n* turn airplane mode on (miss an important call),\n\n* trun off wifi and turn on mobile data (if you have limited data and don't notice get ready to pay),\n* turn on hotspot to drain battery or \n* turn on total silence to make you miss your alarm or call.\n\nI know you can remove these with the edit option, but come on, this makes quick settings useless.\n\nAlmost all oem skins (and ios and windows phone) ask for a password when changing settings like these, why can't google include such a simple thing?\n\nSo i had to do an edit for 3 things:\n\n* I realised the phone can be turned off but the settings should still persist. If someone turns it back on you should still have a chance of finding it. Apps like cerberus have options to fake a shutdown if a thief tries to turn off your phone (i'm not expecting google to do this but a pin/password for shutdown option would be nice)\n\n* \"Sensitive content\" notifications probably took a lot more to implement (both ux and dev effort wise) why hasn't anybody done something simple like this?\n\n* My dream would be for google to use its \"trust score\" - another feature they announced and talked about it once or twice ever since, but i encourage you to look it up, it's a really cool idea. The idea is that smart lock features like Bluetooth devices, location, on body detection, etc along with things like last time when the pin/password was entered or fingerprint was used along with other user data are used to determine how probable is it that you (as the owner) are using the phone. Best example is on body detection: if you set the phone down or it detects sudden movements it will lock itself, but if just used your pin/password and it thinks you are holding the phone it will stay unlocked until it think you're not holding it.\n\nEdit2: [Blueborne](https://www.armis.com/blueborne/) may sound like something from watch_dogs, but as you can see in the [Android demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Az-l90RCns8) it behaves like a bluetooth mouse, so this makes it ridiculously easy for an attacker to turn settings on/off from the lockscreen.",

            "selftext": "I currently own a HTC 10, and was watching some video of the Pixel 2 when I started noticing some similarities so I thought I'd point them out to see what the general consensus was on them.\n\nFirst some background: compared to the Pixel 2 XL, the Pixel 2 has squarish corners and a larger bezel. It's also made by HTC rather than LG.\n\nNow, here's the first thing I wanted to point out. [Look at the antenna bands here.](https://puu.sh/xRb33/e245d96677.png) [Now, look at this photo of a HTC U11.](https://www.htc.com/managed-assets/shared/desktop/smartphones/htc-u11/explorer/en_US/htc-u11-silver-global-phone-listing.png) You can see that all of the ones marked in red are pulled directly from that phone. On top of that, look at the profile of both phones--both corners have the same curvature, that squarish look that sets this phone aside from the larger phone. [You can tell the curvature better from this photo](https://fscl01.fonpit.de/userfiles/6727621/image/2017/HTC-U11/AndroidPIT-HTC-U-4753-w782.jpg)\n\nLastly, let's look at the last hallmark of HTC design. This takes a little bit of explaining, so bear with me. Back with the [HTC One M7](https://cf1.s3.souqcdn.com/item/2015/01/20/77/67/74/8/item_XL_7767748_6705451.jpg), HTC introduced a new, groundbreaking design, one they would build off of for years. Part of this design was a black strip below the display that housed the capacitive buttons and a HTC logo. Weirdly, the HTC logo in the center prevents that area from being used as a home button, so it's shoved off to the side and the multitasking button is removed. Later teardowns confirmed that they were using the area under the HTC logo as the place where they stored their touch digitizer driver. With the [HTC One M8](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Wes6Wfr5L._SL1500_.jpg), they removed the capacitive buttons but kept that little black bar with the HTC logo. Fans started to grumble about it existing but otherwise lived with it. With the [HTC One M9](http://www.htc.com/managed-assets/shared/desktop/smartphones/htc-one-m9/Sketchfab/htc-one-m9-global-sketchfab-gunmetal.png), though, fans were very vocally against it existing, and among many other reasons, that phone was a complete financial disappointment for HTC. So for the HTC 10, they got rid of--[no, it's still there, they just found a way to hide it.](https://i.imgur.com/dX2uBNi.jpg) And if you look at the U11, you can probably see it in the exact same spot, hidden just as well.\n\nSo, what about the Pixel 2? [You tell me.](https://puu.sh/xRbBs/2019bec6e4.png)\n\n\n**TL;DR** hire some new designers and engineers HTC, jesus.",

            "selftext": "Google said it was taken out to make way for a bezel less future. But wheres the proof of it? The Pixel 2 has the same ugly bezels that the pixel 1 had. The Pixel 2 XL has a somewhat better screen but it still doesn\u2019t feel like a proper excuse to remove the jack as there are still huge bezels on BOTH sides. Should they should have kept the jack on the Pixel 2 and removed it from the XL?\n\nApple says its to ease waterproofing and they simply didn\u2019t have enough space. Yet they only achieved IP67 instead of IP68. But a guy on youtube proved its somewhat possible.\n\nAgain what I want to point out is competition has proven all this wrong. I'm no Samsung fanboy but it can be clearly seen that Samsung has the finest design out there. MicroSD, IP68, Headphone Jack, and a great infinity screen. They even curved the screen at the sides! So isn\u2019t whatever excuse google and apple make invalid? Cause Samsung has already proven them all wrong way back in 2017 March. \n\nWhat I feel like is manufacturers are making lazy excuses to just cut off the headphone jack so they don\u2019t have to spend much time in making it work. This is what I love about Samsung is they go all out, no compromises. Wireless charging to headphone jack they load their shit with everything they can find.",

            "selftext": "I started using Android from day 1 with the HTC G1. The thought of a search company making a phone was so profound to me that I had to try it. Since then, I've stayed on Android but have tried Samsungs, HTCs, Motos, Nexuses, and everything in between. The past year I switched from the Note 7 to the Pixel XL, and I finally got a taste of what iPhone fans mean when they say \"it just works\". The Pixel is the most effortless phone I've ever used. It's smooth, takes amazing photos, is just as fast as the day I got it, and has some great resale value now that I am upgrading. I've never had to think about installing launchers or third party photo apps, or rooting or resetting or anything. It just works.\n\nThis is why upgrading was a no-brainer. I didn't even give it a second thought. It didn't matter if they stripped out the jack or had larger bezels, I knew my choice before the event even started because I'm willing to sacrifice all of that for a consistent and smooth user experience.\n\nI'm glad Google found a way to keep the Pixel as the best camera on the market. For someone that takes a ton of photos of my kids, I can't stress how seamless it is to take fantastic pictures and have them instantly uploaded to Google Photos to start doing its assistant magic.\n\nWatching the Google event, I felt Google's long term plan is two things in a nutshell:\n\n[1] Build the brand, slowly but surely.\n\n[2] Create products that are hard to leave once tried.\n\nI think [1] above is why the prices are \"premium\". Google can't raise the prices later when they start to sell more units. They tried that with the Nexus and it ended up feeling like a \"mid-tier\" device. Mind share is an important concept, so they want to sell the fact that the \"just works\" experience is worth the price of admission. Maybe I am in the minority, but the experience is worth it to me over specs on paper. Google knows it will add more Pixel users each year, and as long as it can retain the current users, it believes its market share and mind share will continue to grow slowly. This is evidenced by the Pixel already being a bigger brand after 1 year than the Nexus was after several.\n\nI think [2] above is why the experience matters so much. For anyone that has used the Pixel for any extended period, feel free to chime in. It is hard to go back to lag and waiting around for updates once you're used the Pixel.\n\nSome additional thoughts on a few hot topics:\n\n[a] Headphone jack: Google knew they will eventually have to remove the jack at some point. Their thought was likely let's do it now instead of next year when the Pixel will have an even greater identity. They probably wanted to get it out the way as they get more and more immersed in the design and production of their phone.\n\n[b] Bezels: I think Google was caught between a rock and a hard place because HTC was the partner on the smaller Pixel and they haven't yet designed a bezel free phone, but they still had to release the Pixel. Whatever the background reason is, I'm sure it wasn't that they wanted to release a phone with huge bezels. They probably see it as initial pains while they get their design house in order and start designing without being limited by what the manufacturer can actually put out.\n\n[c] Verizon: This is an interesting situation and I think it has all to do with maintaining control. Verizon probably plays ball on keeping the bloat out and providing Google with direct access to deliver day 1 updates. The other carriers (AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile) are probably resisting and trying to sign a deal where they can pre-load uninstallable bloatware or ship it with their logos or control the updates themselves or whatever else. I'm glad Google is resisting the temptation to just jump in with them in order to get them to carry the Pixel. Hopefully eventually they'll play ball and we'll see the bloatware-free Pixel on all carriers.",

Battery  life is also shockingly good. Software is also WAY better than it was on my S6.  Strangely, the only time I ever see frame drops is when I change the power mode in the settings.

Do you feel the combination Google talked about was good enough to take away attention from Apple's bionic chip? On the surface , I think they did make a compelling case . Even though Snapdragon 835 doesn't sound all that interesting, what Google did with the camera ( apparently custom designed) , improvements to assistance etc , combined with the camera made for a compelling case. \n\nAm an android fan and firmly deep in the Google ecosystem so though biased, I really feel Google delivered in term selling it's AI strategy. I definitely bought into the marketing / realities you name it , that was presented.

I feel that I would change the track of a song more often than adjusting volume.  In addition, the physical buttons on phones dedicated to volume adjustment.  You are able to change volume while the phone is still in your pocket.  I think it was the Verge review/preview that mentioned that they may look into adding more swipe actions to the product but currently those functions don't exist.  I am hoping that they do have updates planned.  It sounds like current state, you need to open your music application to skip a track.  Another solution would be to double tap the phone's volume buttons to skip tracks.  However, I think this only works with headphones with inline controls though.  Just thinking out loud. ",

I can't find mine.\"  \nMe: \"No, you lost the last pair I lent you.\"**\n\n**I visit Microcenter.  While there, I see some shit earbuds on sale, $3 for a two-pack.  I buy two packs of them, and give them to my best friend.  Problem solved.**\n\n*In [Type-C world?](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DLYnF5DXUAAlFH-.jpg:large)  Impossibly expensive.  She borrows my headphones without permission.  They inevitably get lost.  Our decade+ friendship is strained.*\n\n---------------------\n\n**I'm on a train to visit my sister.  The 7 hour ride is delayed by 5 hours, because Amtrak, like Google, has lost its way.  I plug my phone into the provided outlet.  I plug my headphones into my phone.  I listen to audiobooks and podcasts, and have a relaxing journey.**\n\n*In the land of Pixel 2, my bluetooth headphones run out of juice less than halfway through.  I remember that I have an emergency set of headphones in my suitcase!  The adapter is at home.  I stare at my headphones in dismay as they charge.  Alternatively, I have some Type-C headphones.  My phone battery dies halfway through the trip.  I plug it in to charge, and browse the internet because I can't listen to audio content.  I get motion sickness.  The world spins in pain.*\n\n----------------------\n\n**I'm in Denmark, visiting my boyfriend's family.  We return to the room in the evening, and charge our devices with the foreign outlet converter, which includes integrated USB outlets.  Our phones, our spare battery packs.  There's the perfect number of outlets.  The trip is lovely, and our love for each other grows.**\n\n*In the dystopia of the new Google phone, we discover that there's one to few outlets to charge everything.  A fight ensues over who should have brought more converters.  We break up, and both die alone.*\n\n---------------------",

            "selftext": "This is a question I've contemplated for a while... With Samsung really making this feature a flagship must-have and Apple joining that stance this past September, it really seems like this is almost an auto-include for flagships. However, Google's Pixel and now Pixel 2 don't have it... I'd say at first I was surprised or disappointed but I really wasn't and after thinking about it a bit more, I don't think I care if my phone has wireless charging if it means it becomes more fragile or more expensive.\n\nTo be clear, I don't care if my phone has wireless charging IN IT'S CURRENT STATE. At the moment, you basically need a wireless charging stand that is plugged into the wall in order to wirelessly charge your phone. Now is that REALLY that much more convenient than needing to carry around cord with you? If you travel, you'll still need a cord for the stand and now you need the stand with you, which if anything is MORE inconvenient than a charging brick. If getting a questionably convenient feature means more fragility and/or more expensive phones, I don't think I'm on board or care about that feature...\n\nThe reason I post this is maybe we don't need wireless charging right now... The most promising charging pad seems to be that AirPad Apple is coming out with and that is still very limiting for reasons I've mentioned above. And this even brings me to why I'm posting this in the first place. The messages from my Samsung and Apple friend who know I'm a huge Google fanboy are \"super fun\" and I also feel kind of guilty. I was a critic of Apple \"not having wireless charging\" on the 7 and 7+ so I feel like I definitely goofed a bit.\n\nBut I want to start an open discussion about wireless charging on our smart devices! Do you think that in its current state that it's good enough to be a flagship must-have or is this the 3D TV feature of the smartphone?",

The Nexus 4 had it and it was **released in 2012**! \n* **Headphone jack and the dongle life.** I know this is a big topic but why do I have to worry about a clunky dongle to be able to use my headphones? \n* **Headphone jack and my car's AUX input.** I have a perfectly running 2010 car with only an AUX input, why do I have to get an adapter to be able to use it instead of a direct connection?\n* **Headphone jack and charging at the same time.** This goes back to the first bullet. If you want me to charge my phone at the same time while listening to music or an audiobook while driving or in the office, why not offer wireless charging? Now you're making me get a dongle to resolve this? Lord.\n\nI was so excited watching the livestream of the unveiling as I learned about all these amazing software improvements and offerings in the Pixel 2. I said to myself, eff it, I'll embrace the dongle life. I purchased a P2XL and ended up canceling that order. I realized that while the software was amazing, why isn't the hardware up to par? Why am I making these sacrifices to legitimize this phone? Oh all because of the camera? The camera isn't the only thing we care about here.\n\nI came back down to Earth and realized that Google was playing me. When Android phones started getting larger, Apple fans laughed at us and then ended up following suit. When Apple got rid of the headphone jack, we laughed at them and now **WE** end up following suit.\n\nI'm pretty proud of myself for canceling this order. I am such a huge fan of Android and what Google does but this is certainly not one of them. If I were to spend up to (or over) $1000 for a phone, and it's considered the flagship of GOOGLE, I better have the hardware to back it up.\n\nThis time around, I'll let my voice heard by not contributing to the cause.

S8/8+ - Bloat even in hardware (bixby button). Still running 7.0, so future of s/w updates look bleak after Oreo update.\n\n2. Note 8 - Higher cost than xl2\n\n3.

Sure the headphone jack would have been nice, the bezels on Pixel 2 are bug enough etc but let's think about the flaws. \n1/2mm bezels on Pixel 2 is really going to affect you? In your day to day usage- no. For once, I'm glad im getting a phone with those bezels because I can't fucking hold my phone in landscape mode without accidently touching the screen. \nI don't have to concave on palms for it to sound louder. \nI'm glad there's a no headphone jack. I haven't used a headphone jack on my phone ever since I got my Motorola surround for 20 bucks. It helps water proofing my phone so that's good enough for me. IP67 is great too, I certainly am not going to take my phone surfing. Or even swimming. If I do, I'll be sure to use a good protective cover.\nI feel we have reached kind of a full stop, temporarily, when it comes to hardware.  \n\nThe phone is all about the software. Google assistant. Hands free. Always on display. Google lens. Music. Stock Android. Even software for camera! \nIt's more about the ecosystem now than it ever was. The software is what is going to help a phone be a success. \nSure the headphone jack is good to have but it's replaceable. Sure the bezels should have been thinner but it more ergonomic. \n\nI've used Moto X1, when always on display debuted. It was fantastic and I'm so glad it's here. Always a fan of Google goggles from years back. Always used stock Android phones. Slates Bluetooth earphones till i got one ($20 for Moto surround) and I haven't used wired earphones since. Even on my laptop! I don't use camera much but good to have a great camera. Bezels don't really bother me. I don't watch tonnes of videos on my phone, but meh. But happy to know that I can hold my phone without accidently touching the screen. \n\nIf v30 or s8 is your answer to this, then I would think again. Software>everything else. \nI would give up my Pixel for Pixel 2 just for Google Lens, it's that good. \n\nAll in all, Pixel 2 is a solid phone with a few amisses (subjective). \n\nI'm getting mine in a few weeks!\n",

The lack of a headphone stopped me from loving the Pixel 2 *by itself.*\n\nI was thinking to myself, \"drummerDKS, just get some fancy bluetooth headphones!\" That's such A) a cop-out and B) an extra $50 add-on I'd have to pay just to use my phone as I wanted in the first place. Plus I've already got a ton of headphones I'd rather be able to use already. Ear buds, over-ears, all these things I enjoy. And no fucking way I'm paying $160 for Google's fancy wireless buds, as cool as they may be.\n\nAlright, so what are the less expensive options? Something I can do to use all of my current headphones with this jack-less amazing phone.\n\n**A Bluetooth Receiver**. It seems like such a simple fix. Yes, it's another $20. No, it won't be great for audiophiles. But it WILL let me listen to my music on the go. It's one more thing to charge, sure. But the battery life makes it so I can do it once maybe every few days either overnight or at work.\n\nIt's not ideal, but it's certainly doable. Plus it's another handy piece of inexpensive tech. Making lemonade from otherwise delicious lemons.\n\nIf I end up going for the Pixel 2, I'll probably get [this receiver](https://smile.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Receiver-Microphones-TaoTronics-Activation/dp/B075F1DV91) from Amazon. There's other options.

There are a lot of attractive things about the Pixel 2, but there are also things that tick me off. It's not the \"perfect phone\" some of us were hoping for (which yeah probably doesn't exist to be fair but still). And I know I should probably wait for reviews to fully judge the phones.\n\n\nBut here's the thing: the reviews will be good. They ALWAYS are. And in three months, there'll be tons of posts on this subreddit about \"how great the Pixel 2 is\" or \"OMG the camera on this phone is PHENOMENAL.\" Sure, they're great phones! Those posts are warranted. But I just hope we don't forget the things Google screwed up on like we kinda did with the OG Pixel. We're all Android fanboys of course. We live and breath the stuff, at least I assume most of us do. So I get the excitement and the love and the praise we throw Google's way when stock Android gets its time in the limelight. But there are problems here. No included headphones. No headphone jack. The bezels on the pixel 2 are...well I'm not really that picky about pixels but come on. Even Sony looks at those bezels and thinks \"daaaaaaaaaang.\"\n\n\nAnyway, that's just my two cents. Try to remember this mild frustration when all the reviewers and r/Android laud everything about this phone. Buy the pixel 2 if it's your jam, and don't buy it if it's not!

Most video playback services now require an [HDCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-bandwidth_Digital_Content_Protection) compliant device chain. As of today, Google Play Video and Amazon Prime require HDCP 2.2 to play HD content.\n\nIt seems inevitable that companies like Sony (who holds a mountain of audio properties) will mandate something like [SCMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Copy_Management_System) for playback in bluetooth devices. Without an analog port, it will become extremely difficult to play music from your phone over speakers. Instead, you'll have to buy some cryptographically verified bluetooth playback device.\n\nEventually, when enough of the market switches over to bluetooth playback, media producers will start demanding that all playback be authenticated to protect against piracy.\n\n**What they have to gain:**\n\n* Sony would sell a ton of bluetooth devices, both through initial adoption and regular upgrades to newer versions\n* Bluetooth-device tied exclusives\n* Licenses could be encoded into the music to restrict playback on devices that aren't \"single user\" like headphones\n* Region locking could be implemented\n* Media producers can sue content copiers for violation of the DMCA\n\n**What they have to lose:**\n\n* Some customers will choose to stop streaming music or return to piracy rather than buy compliant bluetooth headphones\n\n**Links**\n\n* [Sony page on SCMS-T](https://us.en.kb.sony.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/43920/~/what-is-scms-t-content-protection-method%3F)\n\n* [Plantronics help page on SCMS-T errors](http://www.plantronics.com/us/support/kb/detail.jsp?vfurl=/articles/en_US/Troubleshooting/RN8345&c=All&lang=en_US&region=us)\n\n* [List of Creative brand devices supporting SCMS-T](http://support.creative.com/kb/ShowArticle.aspx?sid=94429)\n\n* [Bluetooth standard notes on content protection, including SCMS-T and DTLA](https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/assigned-numbers/audio-video)\n\n* [DTCP, which is a content protection scheme backed by DTLA, which was founded in party by Intel who *also* created HDCP](http://www.dtcp.com/dtcp.aspx)\n\n**Question time:**\n\n1. Is an HDCP like standard coming to audio on android devices?\n2. If yes, how long?\n3. If no, why not?\n4. Do you oppose DRM in the audio stream?\n5.

            "selftext": "Phone companies are in a rut. That rut is brought on by a lack of technical innovation. Sure, they can cram a better camera, better processor, better screens, etc. into a new phone with an even longer battery life. They can make a VR headset. They can make a speaker. They can make a computer. Everyone is doing the same thing. Google put out these products with a focus on maintaining status quo. Everyone was here for a hardware presentation. But what we saw was the beginning of the shift towards a new doctrine of phones. \n\nAs many topics in recent weeks have shown, phones have plateaued. A mid range phone in 2013 was barely functional. In 2015 a mid range phone was acceptable. Today a mid range phone works great. The flagships push numbers slightly higher and higher, but over the years they haven't been pushed far enough. The rapid development we saw over those first 5 years is over. Phone hardware is at its peak. Simultaneous with the old mentality of the phones was the apps. The idea that you could have individual programs that could take advantage of so many services on your phone. \n\nIn 2013 Apple sparked the genesis of this conversation with Siri, albeit in a shallow, 2 dimensional way. Siri was an assistant. She had the illusion of personality and a new way to interact with the phone. But what this really sparked was the beginning of the Phone AI. Sundar Pichai has repeated over and over again that Google is now an AI company. What this means is not developing Siri or Skynet, but instead developing a system. \n\nSystems are something that I find fascinating. From a gaming perspective a system is what allows a game to be truly open and engage creativity, clever problem solving, and ingenuity. Take the Zelda series for example. In Skyward Sword you were able to have a game with good dungeons and decent gameplay. It was linear, and all puzzles had defined solutions. There was some freedom in your decisions but not much. This is due to a linear design and it is akin to a program. In Breath of the Wild, the game relies on a series of systems. Namely, a system based on elements of fire, wind, physics, and nature. Trees can be cut down, grass can burn, when a fire is large enough it causes a vertical air flow. The systems go on and on and lead to a game that appears the same on the surface, but has much more room for creative problem solving and varied solutions. \n\nWhat Google has done is they have taken Siri (Skyward Sword) and turned it into Assistant (Breath of the Wild). On the surface level it is similar, and it had me fooled at first. But then in the presentation one of the features blew my god damned mind. The ability to listen to music and be able to match it to a song based on patterns alone. No uploading it to a server that then cross-references it with the sound files of other songs to try and locate it. Instead the system has already done that, analyzed it, and created a pattern by which it can identify what it is simply based on hearing it. The lifting of analyzing the songs is done before the question is even asked. The patterns are then able to detect your song way faster than anything soundhound had made. This small feature is the signal of what is to come. \n\nThe pixel earbuds' translation is the next part that blew me away. I don't really care for the hardware, as I already have a pair of truly wireless earbuds (Bragi Headphone), but that's not what got me. When the presentation began and there was the twitter picture of the two kids communicating via Google Translate I thought it was just a pat on Google's own back. I was impressed, but I knew this technology was already at that level. The comments were about how the speaker looked at this and was disappointed how the interaction as awkwardly complex, that it should be simpler. I thought, great a goal to strive for, that's awesome, but the tech is 5 years down the road. Then they whip out these earbuds and have a normal conversation between English and Swedish. HOLY FUCK. But then, the fact that, similar to the music recognition, this is happening on the device in a similar way to patterns. No heavy lifting needed as the machine learning has already taken care of it.\n\nAn older product, [Google Goggles,](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.unveil&hl=en) is actually very relevant to this discussion again. It analyzed barcodes, images, text, landmarks, etc. and was able to identify what they were via the camera. Neat, but in its infancy at the time. This goal was set and now the assistant is capable of meeting the expectation of analyzing the real world and being able to bring that to your own interaction. \n\nThe Google Clips is an example of this too. I actually was not paying attention during this part as I was focused on getting my Pixel 2 XL ordered in time. Having read up on it the clip works in the same way. It is a camera that detects what joyous moments are and the is able to learn via expressions, gestures, and interactions by waiting for those moments to appear. In a way it's like the Play of the Game from Overwatch but with happiness replacing an amazing play. It learns what moments are happy and then is able to use that information to record happy moments that are happening. With no internet connection. No required input even. It learns what looks like happiness and records it. This product isn't so much about the actual product being amazing, but again, to reinforce the idea of machine learning being the underlying discussion here. These products are here to show where we are going. \n\nWhat Google has shown in this conference is that they are not okay with simply putting a facial ID on your phone that scans your face and then uses it for security, but rather that they are interested in taking the world and making it into an interaction with your phone through AI. The machine learning we see here is not focused on just peddling a product, it is focused on bringing us beyond what we previously thought was possible with our phones. What brought me to android was Google Now. What's making see that it's where the future lies is the Assistant. It takes  all these existing pieces of the phone hardware, the internet, the software, and then applies machine learning to them to radically accelerate the interactions between us and the rapidness to which we can access information. Google didn't just announce shiny new hardware today, they showed the direction that AI is taking software in. ",

Nothing more. \n\nI can't buy any of the Google products without importing them, and I'm hardly alone. The handful of countries that get hardware sales is ridiculously low. Yes, I'm aware that they've been \"smart\" (Germany is EU; no import tax etc, easy buying for the rest of EU, and so on), but it really feels like we're being purposefully ignored. \n\nGoogle makes a point about bragging about how the smaller phone has all the features of the larger one, taking a stab at Apple. Guess what? Apple sells their phones everywhere. As well as other products. You don't. That's just as important. It was the same story with the first Pixel generation. Hardly seen at all here because it wasn't even for sale. \n\nI'm still interested in Pixel products. And I might import some of them. But it's turning into a less and less exciting event to watch the Google Live streams, simply because I see them talk about all these awesome things (Like Home and Nest) that I can't even buy or use. Just like a lot of other people all over the world can't. It sucks, and it's not exactly making long time Google supporters happy. \n\nI'd gladly have a Google Home device. I can't, according to Google. \n\nIf I could wish for one thing it would be for availability to Googles hardware in another way than importing.

It can turn off my lights, turn off the heater but this was already there before.\n\nIm trying to use Google assistant a bit on my phone right now(Xiaomi mi 6) but I still feel like its a bit buggy at times. Some things work flawlessly but things like simply trying to ask the assistant to play my playlist on YouTube dont work, opening a messenging app and texting someone is a hassle, navigating home specificly asking Google to find a \"only bus\" route and using it to unlock your phone doesnt work. Not to mention it doesnt know words from my country so texting people who dont have a English name or trying to navigate to a place with a non english name is a pain in the ass. \n\nTo me it feels like this technology still is in its baby steps and Google would have done better trying to push it hard maybe in 5 years when \"smart\" technology is better and more common.

These days, they can't even make a fast and modern browser for ARM devices or (getting ready for the downvotes) the desktop.\n\nEverything I'm watching is the same thing I did in all Google events of the last couple of years. Good demos that turn in useless features that no one cares about, and mediocre products that try desperately to ride in the coattails of Apple (or other) products. Congrats on their HomePod, I guess.\n\nSo yeah, it's as of their Pixel devices are like iPhones, but inferior on almost every single way, and only exist for the kind of user that would use anything Google anyway. They probably are chatting with themselves on hangouts or allo or duo, at this time.\n\nIt's weird. Since 2011 I knew that with the experience I was getting from my Air, I would use only Apple laptops. However with smartphones, I've been Android only. At this point, if you are going to buy a smartphone to use many hours per day, every day for the next few years, it just seems silly to not be investing everything in the iOS ecosystem.\n\nWhat the fuck am I gonna do with my poweramp and Nova launcher license.

With Google in the lead as Android's creator plus generally with the Pixel (or Nexus) line as an industry's standard with upcoming software features, these manufacturers may see that...hey, it's really not that big of a deal. And those iPhones/Pixel 2s are selling well (HTC already did the switch, but their stuff just aren't selling super well regardless, I feel)!\n\nWithout a headphone jack, Apple and Google are both making their wireless headphones as a result (or if you're cynical, they removed the headphone jacks so their wireless headphones can sell). This also would likely mean that the other companies are looking at this and see that they can also make their own headsets - what's preventing them from doing it? What if the upcoming Samsung bluetooth wireless headset thingy will work great with the Galaxy S9/Note 9/Gear 3 or 4 with instant pairing (even better, if it's proprietary and only works with Samsung products). It also gives them an additional source of income.\n\nI feel (or fear, rather) that starting in 2018's mainstream flagships, we won't see the headphone jacks anymore. This also means that with more smartphones forgoing the headphone jack, there will be a demand for more lightning/USB C headphones (or they just buy a bluetooth one). I predict that headphone companies will make a lightning and/or USB C headset for real starting in late 2018 (or a 3.5mm with free dongles to switch to these two adapters) to adapt to the market trend as a result. If you want to go one step further, this trend may actually eat into the computer speaker/hifi/audiophile market where lightning/USB C ports would pop up in these devices (and I don't even want to think about going from one universal standard to 3 standards or more just to listen to music, plugged).\n\nAnd that's pretty sad. It's been known that the 3.5mm has been with us for our entire lives, and lived even longer than this. I personally don't think smartphones should lose this feature (because now charging your phone and listening with wired earphones simultaneously is a feature), but I'm not from Apple or Google's engineering team, product development or marketing team. Manufacturing cost is definitely a concern when you make millions of phones, and you're a multinational company that has tens of thousands of employees to pay every month, and factory costs and whatnot. But at the cost of your consumer...then that's harder to justify to the average user. But people are still buying these en masse and I don't know if it's consumerism at play or is it just really a tech cycle where things just phase out.\n\nI do think that the midrange and lower-tier phones will keep the 3.5mm jack however, at least in 2018. They need to target the users who don't have that money to change their headsets or earphones, or just don't want to bother with bluetooth. And these phones would be great in non-first world country markets where these latest technology stuff aren't that common yet.\n\nSo all in all...it's mostly what I feel about what the next flagships are going to be. I might be wrong, maybe Samsung/LG/Sony sees that they do have a difference and a selling point to users who still need it. And I would be more than happy to be wrong and get the choice to have the headphone jack in 2018. But I think it's not going to be good.",

I love asking it to play music, set up cooking timers, add stuff to my shopping list, even answer questions. I'm on the way to adding more smart devices to utilize it more and more. However, with Google adding Assistant to more and more device I've been having some growing pains. \n\nFor example, I now have two phones, a tablet, the google home, and my Shield TV that all respond to the \"Okay Google\" however one major issue is that the Home and Shield TV often incorrectly override and take control. Just now, I was watching youtube on the shield and wanted to pause. I say, \"Okay Google\" and my phone, home, and shield tv all pick up the command. However when I say \"pause\" or \"pause youtube\" or \"pause youtube on the Shield\" the home incorrectly thinks I'm speaking to it and responds \"Nothing is playing right now.\" \n\nAnother example is a request to play music. How can I distinguish which device, be it my phone, home, or TV that I want to respond? \n\nAnother example, with the Shield TV recent upgrade I've encountered another issue with my regular morning request of \"Hey Google What's up today\" which would previously have the Home read out my agenda, weather, and favorite news source now is picked up by the ShieldTV (even though my TV is off) and the home ignores the request and the Shield takes over.  *I understand that the issue may be due to my older TV which lacks CEC. \n\nIt seems like this will only get worse once people have Max, Homes, Minis, TVs, sounds bars, etc. all over their house which all respond to the prompt\n\nWith more and more devices starting to pick up and respond to the phrase what can I (Or Google) do to make the experience better?

Seems like Alexa\u2019s lead in smart home integration isn\u2019t going anywhere anytime soon though.\n\n* The Google Home Mini is **beautifully minimal.** Clearly, Google\u2019s hardware design philosophy nowadays is wrapping everything in stretchy cloth to match their target audience\u2019s \u2018West Elm\u2019 aesthetic.\n\n* You can say **goodbye to Sonos\u2019 five year plan.** They\u2019re going to suffer the same plight that Dropbox suffered whenever iCloud and Google Drive usurped their cloud storage throne. First Apple, now Google is taking over that space and whole home wireless connectivity is no longer a product, it\u2019s a feature. The Google Home Max and the HomePod are going to take over, although I find it un-Google to price their product $50 more than Apple\u2019s at $399.\n\n* Three years in the making, **Nest is actually integrating with Google things now.** While their product line is pretty run-of-the-mill, the intelligent stuff they\u2019re doing with software and automation is great. Being able to use your Nest Camera to alert you who is ringing your doorbell based on facial recognition is pretty sweet.\n\n* The Pixel 2 looks like the best Android phone to date. Having no headphone jack really does show how much influence Apple has in the industry in terms of pushing new hardware choices forward. If Apple hadn\u2019t done this a few years ago, would Google even have had the cool new Pixel Buds (wireless Bluetooth headphones) on their roadmap? Speaking of which, **Google Translate on the go with the wireless headphones** sounds amazing for traveling.\n\n* Google Clips seems so **incredibly invasive of a technology** that they immediately got defensive about privacy concerns literally ten seconds after announcing it. It seems cool in theory, but I wonder what sort of demographic they\u2019re going for other than couples who just had a baby? Is it just a nanny cam that takes pictures occasionally? Also it reminds me too much of The Circle for me to be supportive of it.\n\ntl;dr Overall, Google seems to have finally **reached a point of comfort in their hardware line.** There\u2019s definitely a vision here, and everything announced fits into that singular vision (much like Apple) super well. This is at odds with what Amazon decided to do with their Echo line, which more akin to throwing a bunch of stones to see which one hits. ",

            "selftext": "Basically just as last year, there is little incentive to buy a Pixel phone in Europe thanks to their pricing. IMO Google can't compete with the already fallen prices of devices from the same generation that launched six months prior to its release. Apple can do that because they are the only source of iOS devices and in 2017 there are probably a good amount of users that simply don't want to switch ecosystems. On top of that, Apple is portrayed as an innovative force in the phone space as well as a trend setter, Goolge hasn't archived the same image for its hardware offerings.\n\nAnyway, lets let the number speak for themselves. The more interesting Pixel 2 variant XL is display size wise with its 6\" screen exactly in the middle between the 5.8\" Galaxy S8 and the bigger S8 Plus (6.2\"). \n\nThe S8 is currently available between around 530 Euro and 580 Euro here in Germany from a bunch of retailers, including more known ones and even Amazon.de directly. The 6.2\" S8+ is available starting at 620 Euro.\n\nhttps://geizhals.de/?fs=galaxy+s8&in= \n\nThe cheapest Pixel 2 XL costs you 940 Euro here, with judging by last years model little chance of 3rd party retailers offering it cheaper any time soon. And that is only for the 64 GB model of the SD slot missing phone, while the Samsung's also have 64 GB on top of SD support (with a 64 GB sd card available below 20 Euro). The IMO more comparable 128 GB model is 1050 Euro. That is only 50 Euro less than **two** Galaxy S8 + a 128 GB SD card cost you!\n\nIf we look at the LG G6 which in many ways resembles the Pixel 2 XL's hardware (since LG made both devices) the pricing situation looks even worse. The G6 (32GB, SD slot) is currently available starting at 415 Euro, less than half of what the cheapest Pixel 2 XL costs you!\n\nhttps://geizhals.de/?fs=lg+g6&in=",

            "selftext": "(Or rather, Android OEM's succeeded in making me feel that way. Now I am confused if it's a direly negative thing or not. :o)\r\n\r\nWay back 2013, I owned my first Android tablet, a second-hand Nexus 7 2012. I fell in love with the device but gave it to my younger sister as a present. I bought a Nexus 7 FHD after that and held on to it for a year.\r\n\r\nGiven the price, gorgeous screen, likeable size and processor that was optimized, it surely is an amazing device. I have done a lot of things on it with regards to rooting, installing custom ROM's and customizing launcher experience with Nova Launcher Prime and Zooper Widgets Prime. With the rant of users on Touchwiz and other heavily customized skins, I felt the negative stigma against non-vanilla Android. Those were the times that I thought,\"I'd never get an Android device that doesn't run on stock OS.\"\r\n\r\nMan, never was I proven more incorrect than that time. A year later, I sold my Nexus 7 since mine doesn't have cellular connectivity. I need to have two mobile devices with different networks since my job requires me to travel a lot within our country and also have the ability to at least reply to SMS anywhere I went. So I bought a cheap Chinese phone, the Xiaomi Mi 3. I just went along the Xiaomi craze but I was delighted with it even though it is heavily customized. I was also considering the Nexus 5 during those times but decided against it because of low battery and price. \r\n\r\nWith my new heavily customized Chinese phone, I immediately forgot the timely updates and stock Android experience that the Nexus 7 provided. MIUI has a lot of functionality that I even didn't try to root it! I was using almost every MIUI app (File Manager, Browser, etc) though I used Nova Launcher for the love of customizing home screens, Poweramp and MX Player.\r\n\r\nThe next phone I got was the Meizu MX4. Almost same story with the Mi 3 except that the stellar sound output, IGZO panel, two years of use and additional features gave me an overall more fulfilling experience with it. My longer time with the Meizu MX4 meant that I had a phone still running on Lollipop while the others have Marshmallow already (better for Nexuses with Nougat), but that doesn't matter since my phone works great and Meizu even made this Card-ish style on Flyme OS that looked Marshmallow-y! I gave my mom the Mi 3, and two months ago, the MX4 (which now serves as a Spotify device while being connected to a home theater via aux). And she said that both phones still received updates after I gave it to her.\r\n\r\nSo there. In three years of experience with Android phones (even as secondary device only), I didn't feel neither the need to have a stock Android experience nor to have an updated OS every year. As a trying hard working adult, what mattered to me is that my device works when I want it to. Additionally, since I go to places where cellular connectivity is limited, updates won't really be a priority for me. And to add salt to the injury, data packages don't come cheap. Plus, having to updates apps almost every day a week during my vacation leaves (where I have DSL connection for cap-less downloading) felt like an annoyance to me.",

And rightfully so they want their customers to be dependent on them for all their  media consumption and digital needs.\n\nI used to be a die hard Google fan and hated Microsoft with passion. Used Linux on desktop Google Chrome, Google photos, Google docs Android etc you get the point.. I was completely dependented upon Google for almost everything I did.\n\nAll this changed when I started to have small gripes with Google's services I won't go into details but I switched from certain Google products to other alternatives which may or may not be better but they were better for me. \n\n1) I switched from Google Chrome to Firefox (I used to be a Firefox user)\n\n2) Switched from Google photos to Onedrive the compression for me was a big no no... You can't actually tell a difference between good shots but some of the pictures were extremely crippled by Googles compression.. Especially Videos.\n\n3) From Gmail to Outlook.. Multiple Aliases I wished gmail had proper support for this.\n\n4) Docs to Office I love docs for its simplicity but my University doesn't like docs so I had to switch.\n\nI also switched from Linux to Windows 10 as viruses are no longer at least for me an issue. Now I mainly use a mix of Google and Microsoft software... I still love Google maps YouTube, Google Assistant, .. Still use Android.\n\nI don't use a specific \"ECOSYSTEM\" and the argument of seamless integration to me atleast is bullshit... I've been happy with all the services which now I use instead of the services an Ecosystem provides me with My main gaming machine is PlayStation 4 never used Xbox. I use Spotify for music and Netflix for Movies.\n\nThe point I want to make is that is being in an ecosystem worth living with sub-par products even if there is something better available for your needs?

The width game is only won with nonsense aspect ratios. The thickness, weight or duration on a single charge stagnate. Duh, modern phones dropping headphone jacks are still thicker than my Z Ultra. WQHD doesn't bring much over FHD and 4K is a rare unicorn. Heck, it's trendy now to render in non-native FHD and upscale. I can't even.\n\nThe only cool well-rounded device I can think of after 2013 is Sony Z3 Compact.\n\nYes, the newer phones got cheaper per same performance, but so did the 2013 models.\n\nAm I alone in the thought that 2013 was the year of all cool devices and now it's just degradation and gimmicks?",

Everyone else is being forgotten about. So these [Asian] devices are currently having Septembers security patch being rolled out meanwhile US variants are on April and UK variants are on July.\n\n\nI have an unlocked H780 (UK) so assumed I wouldn't have to deal with any carrier delays, which I don't. But apparently LG does not roll out software updates globally, it's all region based. \n\nNow as you can see from the screenshots 1st Line Support claimed there weren't any current security threats to the H780 (BlueBorne!?!?!?). I replied then got a response from 2nd Line Support who verified that July's patch is definitely the latest for the H780 (UK) and that an update will is in the works for the patch (well of course because it's already being rolled out in Asia) but the **MODELS** and **WHEN** have not been confirmed.\n\nComing from an OPO that shipped with CyanogenMod (throwback) then moving over to customROMS (Love you /u/Sultanxda) - being up-to-date wasn't something I ever had to worry about.\n\nNow it's bizzare to think I paid \u00a3550 for an **UNLOCKED VARIANT** of LGs current flagship and to be in a situation like this (anyone thinking about a V30, if you still want it after reading this, it may be worth getting an Asian variant)\n\nSidenote: LG has also has made \"MiniView\" aka one-handed mode region specific as well!?",

            "selftext": "My note 4 died, and I needed something to hold me over till the LG v30 came out.   My carried offered me an LG K20 Plus (Plus has 32gigs vs 16 standard) for 8 dollars a month, no tax and no down payment, and I could upgrade to the LG V30 via the upgrade program.   I could have gotten a premium phone, but taxes on a 900 dollar phone for 1 month didn't make sense. So first budget phone for me, and pleasantly surprised. \n\nAmazed it's actually a good little multi-tasker. Thought the 425 snapdragon would be horrible, but I can stream podcasts/spotify while browsing with no lag.   It seems to take almost everything I throw at it. I don't game on it, just content and media. I ran a 3dmark benchmark just to test fps, the Adreno 308 was as bad as expected. But I tried Blitz world of tanks and Real Racing 3, ran perfectly.  Prob the 720p screen helps the older gpu. \n\nThe 720p screen seems smaller coming from a note, but the text is clear. The screen doesn't have the nice color of a Samsung, but you don't notice it watching youtube or reading.  \n\nBattery life is pretty good, I get about 2-3 days of moderate use with lots of streaming.  \n\nGoogle updates are fast on the download, average install time, but not as fast of as my s7 or note 4 running lineage.\n\nFingerprint scanner is super fast, but annoying as it has no side button to unlock, so you have to use knock to wake in the car cradle.  Liveable, but a side button would have been nice.\n\nNo physical back/home buttons, it uses on-screen that auto hides, swipe up to get the customizable bar, it works and gives you more usable screen.  Think I'd rather have physical buttons.\n\nPicked up a cheap 10 dollar case off amazon and it came with screen protectors. Has a removable battery and sd card slot. Speaker in the rear is ok if wall or hand bounces back, a better case with a front firing speaker port would fix that.  Sitting on a desk or in my car dock, it's loud and doesn't seem to be lacking range. Bluetooth metadata worked fine with my car.\n\nAnd looking over at XDA, I see TWRP and Root, and super easy unlock, but I'm upgrading, and its working for me, so not gonna touch the bootloader or unlock it.  Also my carrier makes you wait 30 days, but now I'm 10 days away from getting the LG V30.   The modding community didn't look too big for the LG K20 and I only saw 1 lineage rom released for it. (no idea if it works)\n\nWould defiantly say this is a good phone as stock and value.  Amazed at how well entry-level phones are now.  Didnt see many people talking about the LG K20 Plus, thought I'd give a mini-review.",

This created the stigma that Google was in charge of it's design from head to toe which gave them the leg to charge a premium for their new devices.\n\nI am not complaining about the price, this is not what this is about. I am trying to understand the direction Google is heading with the Pixel, especially after seeing the supposed rumors of this years models. These two devices don't even resemble one another (from the front). If Google was *really* in charge, wouldn't there be some uniformity in the overall design? The Pixel 2 looks like it was a phone designed in 2015 while the Pixel XL 2 looks like a relevant device.\n\nThis is why I am having a hard time with the \"Phone by Google\" slogan.

Basically if you know the size of the first one, you know how this one will feel size wise as well. \n\nWe also then can subtract the display size horizontal of 68 mm from the device width of 75 mm and determine that the side bezels are approximately 3.5 mm each (3.5 x 2), which puts them closer to the side bezels of the new iPhone X (4 mm) than say the Essential PH-1 (2.5 mm). \n\nEdit to add photos per user request:  https://photos.app.goo.gl/heR0LlPcoLLpMnEk2 - One on the far left is both stacked on top of each other, middle is the 2 XL and right is the old XL.\n\nEdit 2, replaced imgur with Google Photos link - hopefully still works.  Apparently imgur link had nsfw ads or something?\n\nEdit 3, Onleaks shows the dimensions as 157.6 x 76.3 mm and Phone Arena shows them as 155.1 x 76.2 mm. ",

He says that a phone is badly designed if people feel the need to put a case on it to protect it or make it grippier or easier to use. I do kinda agree with him. Phones are devices we carry with us and use extensively so from a design perspective, usability and durability without a case should be one of the most important aspects of a phone. \n\nWhat does /r/android think of this and what phones do/did you feel comfortable going caseless for? Would you prefer if phones were designed to be more usable without a case?

Check out the link [here](https://forum.xda-developers.com/google-nexus-5/orig-development/rom-unlegacy-android-project-t3593425).\n\nThe download can be found in the download section on the top bar. **Other than mobile data**, Everything major works. Screen, WiFi, RIL (calls, texts), camera, audio, etc. The only thing that doesn't work is the flashlight when toggled from the quick settings (but it does work in camera). The dev has stated that a fix for mobile data is in the works.\n\nOreo is blazing fast so far! Boot up time is incredibly quick! The apps perform so so well! I was seriously considering the upgrade to the pixel 2 but this phone behaves like a brand new Flagship! I've had 5 apps backgrounded and everything works perfectly and smoothly with zero lag!\n\nI can provide screenshots if you guys want. Let me know! :) Also it's too early to guage battery life. I'll give it a few days for the apps to settle and update the post soon.\n\nEdit: [Here are some screenshots](https://imgur.com/a/PomH6)\n\n\nUpdate Day 1:\nSo it's been a day since I've used the OS and I'd thought I'd give you guys a bit of an update on the battery life on this new release. TL;DR - A bit better than Nougat but massive improvements in standby power drain reduction.\n\n[Here's my battery info including screen on time for today](http://i.imgur.com/DtiDoq6.jpg). When running nougat I would get a similar if not slightly worse screen on time. And on nougat was running a custom kernel and greenify to help extend battery life. There were no such add-ons or enhancements installed on Oreo, so definitely an improvement here. Where I saw major gains was in the standby time department. Seriously, it's amazing! If I don't touch my phone and the screen is off, the percentage does not move. Infact, over 8 hours of no use the battery dropped only 3%!\n\nSo what'd I do during the day to get to that screen on time/battery usage?\nStream music on Spotify (a lot!), SMS a lot, Apple music downloaded music playback, use Android pay a few times, download and set up a few apps, play a very battery, CPU & GPU heavy game (ingress, if you've heard of it) for about 25 minutes, Snapchat, FB Messenger, and of course use Reddit (including typing up this post)! :)\n\nI know that this is the first day and setting up all the apps probably did take an appropriate toll on the battery, and also keep in mind that the battery itself is more than three years old, so if you have a newer battery or a replacement battery installed, you'll get even better results!",

I've been playing around with it for a few hours now, and would be happy to answer questions about it!\n\n[Here's](https://imgur.com/a/7RYUC) some pics *of* the device! (You can see how the back attracts smudges). [Here's](https://imgur.com/a/Xd5w2) a few pics taken *with* the device.  \n\n**A few general thoughts...**\n\nIt feels well-built compared to other phones I've used (as solid as the Pixel, but much grippier) and I like the hardware for the most part. The software, on the other hand, is buggy (more than once, my notifications vanish almost off the screen, but aren't fully dismissed. you can see the streak of white on the left side [here](https://dl2.pushbulletusercontent.com/zBCoJFcaJ2CjR0xeUwmHIbhWST54hCWW/Screenshot_20171002-174003.png)), and Sony has made some questionable decisions with Oreo. (When 'do not disturb' is turned on, for example, there's a [persistent notification](https://dl2.pushbulletusercontent.com/xHuucy1gWuxTlzSod5mFCt873iyCJt7v/Screenshot_20171002-184602.png) that can't be dismissed.) \n\nSince the fingerprint sensor is in the power button, there's not really a good way to check the time/notifications without unlocking the phone.\n\nSony's WiFi icon looks different than stock Android's, which is weird since it's the only icon that's changed. The data transfer indicator arrow now appears beside the WiFi icon instead of inside it, meaning any icons to the left of it get shifted over whenever data is being transferred. Sony includes a setting to hide status bar icons, much like the System UI tuner, but for some reason you can't hide the NFC icon.\n\nA few *nice* things I've noticed is that you can raise your hand in the camera app to automatically start the selfie timer. (The selfies look meh, though.) A swipe down changes between front and rear cameras. Sony lets you choose from three or four different lockscreen clock designs, which is cool, though you'll probably never see them due to the aforementioned fingerprint sensor in the power button.\n\nOverall, the phone is very snappy (Transition animations were too jarring, so I turned them to 2x and it still feels fast.)\n\n**EDIT:** here's some more camera samples I took while out and about today! hopefully the Google Photos link works this time: https://photos.app.goo.gl/SD5o0zfAETTDbHuf2",

The S-pen was a bit small at first but I got used to it quite quickly and feel almost as natural using it now as I do on my Wacom tablet. Though my Note 10.1 is old, it still works great for me and I use it even more than my laptop. 10/10 would buy another S-pen product.\n\nAnyway I wanted to share some of the drawings I've made on this tablet, because back when I first got it, I was frustrated at how hard it was to find reviews from people who actually drew (along with examples of their work). I've also included the app I've used. Here's the link: https://imgur.com/a/GE7Bq\n\nedit2: Wow thank you to everyone who commented!

One stays on earth and the other goes into space on a rocket at a speed close to that of light. The rocket returns to earth 32 years later however the person on the rocket has only aged 10 years.\n\nSo I figured that when someone walks they're obviously moving at a faster speed than if they were sitting still. Now I know that velocity is relative and especially on earth and that stuff, but for the sake of cool things, I'm ignoring the fine nitty gritty details and taking a rough estimate.\n\nSo using the human averages for walking distances and speeds as well as the formula used to calculate the difference in time experienced under different velocities, \nI made an app that uses your phone's in-built pedometer to measure how many steps you walk and then calculate how much time you dilated.\n\nOf course as an Android fan this app will probably only be on Google Play forever and it's just a fun project I made while I didn't feel like doing my homework. :) I'm just in highschool so this app is fairly rough and I was just looking for some feedback so I can make this app better.\n\nPlease enjoy it everyone!

It is quite annoying for us android users that android quite unnecessarily has to resample the audio to 48 kHz on most phones. I stumbled upon this post by r/Degru https://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/5z7h7m/couple_things_to_improve_usb_dac_audio_quality/ and so I decided to try and change some values on different files on the phone.\n\nYou will need root to fix this. Basically, you have to find and edit the files listed below using a file explorer with root access such as Solid Explorer. In these files use the search function and find all values of \"48000\" change those to a value of \"44100\". Note that 3 of these files have 2 versions on different locations in your android. I suggest using the search bar to find the files. Also, I'm sure there are only a few of these that you actually have to change but I changed them all and so far so good. I did this on my Axon7 and my old Nexus 6 and it worked on both those phones.\n\nThe files you have to change:\n\n- a2dp_audio_policy_configurations.xml\n\n- audio.policy.conf\n\n- audio.policy.configuration.xml\n\n- r_submix_audio_policy_configurations.xml\n\n- usb_audio_policy_configuration.xml",

Samsung is the BIGGEST phone producer in the world, I feel as though they can have developers porting their apps to TIZEN or (new os) on a cheaper phone so that a good play store is ready for the higher end phones s9(10) n9(10) and samsungs cheaper phones then could switch back to android? what do you guys think?",

I thought I'd share my solution as I've been testing it out for a while now on my Pixel XL and it's really made my daily use more enjoyable.\n\nI'm using a gestures app (edge gestures, but there are a few) and I'm right handed so I have the right edge set. I've set shortcuts for the nav buttons and notification shade as follows:\n\nSingle tap: back.\nLong tap: home.\nSlide down: notifications.\nSlide up: recents.\n\nI avoided swiping in from the edge as it's a messier movement and I have a screen protector that catches my finger when I do. Since Back is used most frequently, a tap makes sense here. Home is long press (could be double tap, but that increases the response time of single tap if it's assigned). Swipe down notifications and swipe up recents seems intuitive. Also, I suggest making the input sensitivity area narrow. You don't need width for taps or vertical swipes, and it ensures no interference with other apps.\n\nSince this works as an overlay, it's always available and really starts to feel like a baked in Android feature. I'm really impressed with how well it's been working and how intuitive it feels. I did try a few different apps and shortcut variations, but this is my favorite setup.",

You can use USB type-c earphones, or if you have mid-upper range headphones you can just use a USB type-c to aux dongle which will be probably included in the box. The phone already looks better without that blank space and even though I don't like the removal of the headphone jack; I admit that most people don't use them occasionally to care that much about it and it makes sense to remove something as ugly as headphone jack which is not important for majority of the users. I have a pair of sennheiser momentum on-ear headphones and at first I am going to use the dongle, then when sennheiser releases 2.5mm to USB type-c cable, I will switch to that.

            "selftext": "I've recently setup my OnePlus 5 and it's a great phone thus far. More to the point, it's my first time owning an NFC capable device and I was rather excited to try things I've never done before, chief amongst them start paying for things with my phone.\n\nSo after a rather large hiccup, Android Messages crashed multiple times trying to restore my sms backup whilst the stock one plus app did fine, I eventually gave up and setup Android Messages blank and got onto Android Pay. Thankfully a much smoother progress and my card was setup in no time.\n\nTurns out my worries were just beginning. I've seen Apple Pay, I know it requires a fingerprint everytime. Lack of fingerprint scanner is no excuse, you have a pin. Initially I made a classic rookie error, leaving NFC off, but once I got into my stride it's the easiest, fastest payment method ever. Incredible! Fantastic! It's so good! It's... Too good?\n\nAll I do is press the power button to wake my phone to the lock screen, hold it near the reader and boom! Payment pressed, little green tick... Except my phone was never unlocked. It was on the lock screen, my finger was nowhere near the scanner, the phone goes near the reader and my money leaves my bank account.\n\nNaysayers can argue that a card with pay pass or pay wave is no less secure. I refute that with the following arguments:\n\n1) If my card was stolen, I can immediately put it on hold... Via my banking app. Located on my phone. That would be hard to do if my phone was the object stolen.\n\n2) Of course banks also have phone numbers that can place your card on hold too... Which again, is trickier to call when your phone is the object stolen. It's a case of what will happen quicker? Me getting someone to lend me a phone to ring my bank or a brazen thief buying 6 X $99 iTunes gift cards at a nearby supermarket?\n\n3) The most important reason to have always on security is this: Why not? Credit cards with pay wave/pass don't have security because it defeats the purpose. If you put a pin on pay wave it slows it down. However, you still bypass the swiping or inserting and the account selection so it's always gonna be faster than the swipe or insert.\n\nHere's the clincher, all high end, NFC capable phones have the magic solution. A fingerprint scanner that is designed to be blisteringly fast as a selling point. I say, the Android Pay app should default to a fingerprint scan. For those without a fingerprint scanner, you should need to unlock your phone via pin or whatever, & only then should you be able to hold the phone near the scanner and it should pay instantly.\n\nNow Android is built on choice so I agree within settings should be an option to turn off security. It should come with a warning that you are waiving liability should your phone be nicked and then it should ask for a pin/password in order to deactivate security.\n\nFinally I have a question: Who else has had the same experience with Android Pay?",

            "selftext": "Hi there. Let me start this with a little history...\n\nWarning: Long coffee induced post!\n\nI have pretty much been an Android person since the beginning. I tried an iPhone back in the 5s days, but it only lasted a few weeks before switching back. I recently bought a MacBook Pro for school, and it was time for a new phone,  so I got an iPhone 7 Plus. I just figured the same ecosystem and all that...\n\nThat was in June. I just couldn't get used to iOS. Not that it is complicated or anything, but I didn't like navigating it, typing and being locked down. So, here we are with a new Samsung Galaxy S8.\n\nOriginally, I set out to find info about battery life and how much brightness makes a difference. There was an article I came across (many really, but this one in particular was from Tom's Guide). It basically stated to turn like all of the S8's features off to make the battery last longer.\n\nThe article stated not only to turn down the brightness, but to lower the resolution, turn off locations, turn off NFC, turn off always on...the list goes on, really.\n\nI started thinking to myself, what is the point of having this phone with all of these features just to turn them off to save some battery life and how much does it really save and how much does it really matter?\n\nWhat I wanted to ask, and kind of start a conversation about, is: What brightness do you keep your phone on and basically do you turn off any features, or go to the extremes mentioned in the article, to help battery life?\n\nSorry for the long post. I guess my coffee is working as intended lol. \n\nThank you in advance for your responses. ",

            "selftext": "Basically I work with a bunch of industrial designers at work and one of them is very principled about not using a case on his phone, even if he drops it and damages it or cracks the screen. He says that a phone is badly designed if people feel the need to put a case on it to protect it or make it grippier or easier to use. I do kinda agree with him. Phones are devices we carry with us and use extensively so from a design perspective, usability and durability without a case should be one of the most important aspects of a phone. \n\nWhat does /r/android think of this and what phones do/did you feel comfortable going caseless for? Would you prefer if phones were designed to be more usable without a case? For me I loved the soft plastic of the Nexus 5 design, it was really easy to hold and I never felt like I needed a case for it.",

            "selftext": "Google said it was taken out to make way for a bezel less future. But wheres the proof of it? The Pixel 2 has the same ugly bezels that the pixel 1 had. The Pixel 2 XL has a somewhat better screen but it still doesn\u2019t feel like a proper excuse to remove the jack as there are still huge bezels on BOTH sides. Should they should have kept the jack on the Pixel 2 and removed it from the XL?\n\nApple says its to ease waterproofing and they simply didn\u2019t have enough space. Yet they only achieved IP67 instead of IP68. But a guy on youtube proved its somewhat possible.\n\nAgain what I want to point out is competition has proven all this wrong. I'm no Samsung fanboy but it can be clearly seen that Samsung has the finest design out there. MicroSD, IP68, Headphone Jack, and a great infinity screen. They even curved the screen at the sides! So isn\u2019t whatever excuse google and apple make invalid? Cause Samsung has already proven them all wrong way back in 2017 March. \n\nWhat I feel like is manufacturers are making lazy excuses to just cut off the headphone jack so they don\u2019t have to spend much time in making it work. This is what I love about Samsung is they go all out, no compromises. Wireless charging to headphone jack they load their shit with everything they can find.",
