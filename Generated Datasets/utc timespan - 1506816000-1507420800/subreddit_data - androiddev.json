But the problem lies with the CMS - time and time again they have failed to deliver and now the project is over a month past the deadline with no real progress made.\n\nWe have poured so much into the passion project - I feel so down. To have the project come to a halt at the 11th hour.\n\nI am wondering what options do we have?\n- Do I take the source code and find a freelancer? But where do I find a freelancer who can finish a complicated CMS in a short amount of time. The internet is awash with fake reviews and empty promises\n- Do I stick with them and demand they hire a more competent CMS dev?\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks for reading",

            "selftext": "I'm translating my Android app from English to French. I've tried two services, neither of which worked well:\n\n1. The \"Translation service\" in the Play Store dev console. The main drawback here is that they remember the last set of French strings that they gave you, so if you edit them locally, those changes are lost next time. I want to re-upload the existing French strings.xml file each time, but they won't let me.\n\n2. OneSky. They have a serious bug where strings marked `translatable=\"false\"` still show up as needing translation. I reported this bug in July, they reported it fixed in August, and I just tried it now and it's still broken. One option would be to manually strip out those entries, but that bug implies to me that they don't get many Android translations and that other things will break.\n\nI don't want to crowd-source my translations, I'd rather pay someone.

However, we are now expanding to mobile and are creating the mobile version for both our Android and iOS native apps. The question is how and whether it is possible to display the json output of Draft.js in an Android native application, just like web is doing it with React? Is there any library that parses the Draft.js json and displays the result in somekind of native Android view? The same question applies to iOS.\n\nThank you so much for the support, Draft.js seems awesome!\n\nPS: Then comes the more complicated question. How to do the other way around, meaning having a native Draft.js Android editor that creates the same content as web does and produces the json output of Draft.js at the end.\n\n...\n\nI also found a reddit post that actually states the following:\n\n\"Draft-js is unopinionated on how the data should be exported. It is upto the dev on how they want to represent the raw data provided by draft-js. Once you understand the data representation, you can export it to html, markdown or even native views of android or ios.\"\n\nMy question is whether there exist already such tool for Android that can understand the data representation of Draft.js and export it to native Android views?",

            "selftext": "Could someone tell me what is considered the best approach in the Android community?\n\nLet's say I use MVP pattern and do network stuff using RxAndroid. And, for a simple example, I want the following - when user refreshes data, the loading indicator is shown, and if the device is rotated, the indicator is shown again. So a pretty basic task. \n\nNow, there are tons of solutions to this problem. And I keep finding even more the more I read on this. A lot of these solutions revolve around saving Presenters, partially (e.g. by saving Observable somewhere) or entirely (e.g. in a map somewhere in a Singleton). However, personally I find this Presenter-saving business a bit clumsy.\n\nThe way I see the solution, we can just make our network calls in a Repository and make it a Singleton. This way a Presenter doesn't save itself and is simply created from scratch after a configuration change. It then can subsribe to the Repository (via Listener interface or, again, via Observable) to get current loading status, and unsubsribe when the View is destroyed (to avoid memory leaks). Doesn't it make more sense to handle data loading in a place that doesn't need to worry about lifecycle issues? \n\nSo, again, is there a common approach in the community? If not, I'd love to know your personal opinions on this matter.\n\nBy the way, is RoboSpice (and the usage of Service to perform data loading in it) considered outdated now?",

Still, they have some performance issues: the first one probably goes a little deeper than a simple memory leak, but the second seems the exact definition of it.\n\nDoes this happen to many other apps?

I found a tutorial for implementing Google APIs that had a link to:\n\nconsole.**developers**.google.com/apis/dashboard\n\nSo I go there and I get everything set up and it's cool. I see that it tracks my API calls and seems to work ok. So, the next day I go to find this console again and check on things, but there is no actual link to it ANYWHERE on the Google developers site. A google search for \"Developers console\" brings up all sorts of links that take you to:\n\nplay.google.com/apps/publish\n\nWhich is not even close to the same thing. So alright, I go to Android Studio and sign in, to see if there's anything accessible from within the IDE that will send me to the right place. Lo and behold, there is a link to \"Open Google Developers Console\", but THAT takes me to:\n\nconsole.**cloud**.google.com/apis/dashboard\n\nPlease, kind and knowledgeable Android developers... help me understand what I should be doing here.

Since I am currently deciding what direction to take, I thought your opinion might provide helpful insight. After all you are the people who I am hoping to make it easier for. My questions are:\n\n- Do you know about any Android encryption flaws? How about other mobile platforms?\n- Have you implemented encryption in a mobile app? If not, how about in any app?\n- If you have implemented encryption, what issues did you encounter when implementing encryption? If you haven't implemented encryption, why did you choose not to implement encryption in your app?\n- If you have implemented encryption, what could be different that would remedy you from having those issues?  If you haven't implemented encryption, what would need to be different for you to have implemented encryption?\n- How would you order the following suggestions about remedying encryption in Android from most helpful to least helpful?\n    - An Android library that requires minimal setup and in which any non-custom settings are safe by default.\n    - A guide that explains what TLS/SSL is, how to implement it in Android apps, and how to test your implementation.\n    - Some users assume that their TLS/SSL implementation is correct because the HTTP requests they send look like gibberish (e.g. https://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m0qbiv4vd21qir7tc.png). However, this is not always correct - there is safe gibberish and unsafe gibberish. This option is a test tool for Android that decrypts unsafe gibberish and shows it to you.\n    - Many TLS/SSL solutions on StackOverflow are unsafe. This option is posting a corrected solution in the same thread as the unsafe solution and explaining why other solution is unsafe.\n- Where do you imagine a guide to be hosted and what format would it have?\n\nFeel free to post answers in this tread, or pm me.",

This makes me ponder whether I am using the correct architecture for this problem. There seems to be a vivid discussion here on architecture so any pointers people might have are most appreciated.  Note that in my case the database is a realtime firebase database and for the login I use AuthUI.\n\nCurrently I have a static database class (\"MyFirebasedatabase\") which is a default Java class, not an Activity.  \"MyFirebaseDatabase\" calls the constructor of another class \"MyAuthUI\" that calls AuthUI to start the loginactivity . \n\nTo solution to all my problems could be an MVP strucuture with \"MyFirebaseDatabase\" as the view (that extends activity ? ). However are lifetime cycles then still OK and is it possible to have MyFirebasedatabase static ? The issue with static that I found is that callbacks become troublesome.\n\nIn short: what are the best practices to set up a shared database in a project and how do you call activities like logins from this shared database. Much looking forward to feedback. Any pointers would be very much appreciated.\n\n\nAs a more detailed problem description: the challenges I encounter with my current implementation are:\n1) MyFirebaseDatabase has an \"Init\" function that is run once (by switching a boolean). Sounds like a subideal situation.\n2) creating a login screen with AuthUI requires an Activity. This means that I will need to pass the context or Activity as a parameter trough \"MyFirebaseDatabase.Init(Context context)\" which then passes it as a parameter to \"MyAuthUI(Context context)\". It works but due to my \"noobyness\" I am not sure what might happen with this structure in the future - doesn`t sound very faillsafe to me.\n3) If I signal a new user registration in \"MyAuthUI\" I want to handle the databaseInitialization of this new user in \"MyFirebaseDatabase\" (Kind of like an MVP structure between MyFirebaseDatabase which would be the view and MyAuthUI which would be the presenter). This is currently not possible.\n\n\n\n\n",

            "selftext": "Fair warning, I'm gonna rant a little here.\n\nI've been working on an app for over a year now, and I am incredibly frustrated by Android's Transitions API. \n\nGoogle announced Material Design with the promise of big, beautiful animations and transitions with meaningful motion. As someone trying to follow the guidelines to the books, it's mostly just brought headaches. That said, I've been able to work around most of the problems I've had: the evil sorcery that is CoordinatorLayout, the random crashing of custom animations because of the animation thread, when to use the support library and when to not. \n\nThe Transitions API however, has crossed a line. \n\nIt started out OK, I suppose, if a bit confusing. Activity Transitions were my first experience with Transitions, and while I can't say I really knew what I was doing, in the end everything seemed to work after following the tutorials to the letter, and I got some nice looking and pretty smooth shared element transitions.\n\nIt all went downhill from there.\n\nI soon realized that I wasn't going to be able to accomplish what I needed to with Activities alone. I poked around a bit, and decided on Conductor. After all, it was the new, hip thing to try, right? \n\nBig mistake. \n\nShared element transitions in Conductor were an absolute *nightmare*, exacerbated greatly because I could never figure out why anything was going wrong (this will be a common theme going forward). I looked up some tutorials, ported my transitions over, and... nothing. It just blinked and flashed several times before abruptly popping to the next screen. So, debug it, right? I looked up my issues and found that it seemed to be a relatively common problem, and there were a few issues on GitHub, with what seemed to be potential solutions. After perusing these solutions for hours, I finally came up with something that sort-of resembled a transition. The problems? First, the entire screen flashed to black before transitioning, entirely ruining the intended effect. Second, the transition was just wrong. The image always immediately teleported to the top-left corner of the screen when beginning the transition. After trying for several more hours in vain (somehow, all the samples worked, despite doing almost the exact same things), I gave up.\n\nWell, it's just an issue with a third-party library, right? So next, I decided to switch to Fragments. The first decision I made was whether to use real Fragments or support library fragments. Despite only having to support 5.0+, to ensure consistency, I decided on support library fragments.\n\nAgain, big mistake.\n\nThis experience was barely better than Conductor. Although being a little easier to setup, ultimately the issues I had were very similar to those of Conductor. At least this time, the image only teleported about 30 pixels above the intended location rather than the top-left corner. I tried in vain to get this to work, all the while getting more and more confused by the Transitions API, which helpfully provides *no logging whatsoever*. But, at long last, I again was forced to admit defeat.\n\nSo, third time's a charm, right? I gave up on the support library and decided I would use the actual inbuilt platform Fragments. And... it worked! To some extent, at least. It wasn't particularly easy, but after debugging several issues, I finally got to a point where the transitions sort-of worked. But not on Lollipop, for some reason, and each transition only worked perfectly once (subsequent times would cause the image to randomly shrink to one-fourth its size). I figured I could solve these later though, and so I happily went on my way, finally able to work on the other parts of the app that had been much neglected through my Transition adventure.\n\nAnd things were good. Until Oreo.\n\nI didn't get Oreo until about a week ago to test, but let me tell you that it disappointed in a big way. For some unknown reason, Shared Elements have completely stopped working. And I can't get them to work. Despite being armed with all of this past experience, I simply can't get those stupid transitions to function. And there's no error messages or helpful logging of any kind, because there never is. It just blinks from one screen to another like nothing's wrong in the world. This time, it's even broken the *samples*. I downloaded a simple sample, and while the entrance transition did work, the return transition? Gone. No reason why, no explanation, no way to figure out what's going wrong, and that's in a project with 3 classes. \n\nThis time, I'm done with the Transitions API. I've given up letting this ridiculous monster of an API control me. I'm switching to using custom Animations. It's going to be a lot of work, but at this point I don't really care. Anything's better than the Transitions API, and with Animations, at least when something goes wrong I can figure out what it is.\n\n/Rant",

I received a free course on Udemy, but it's several years old and therefore a bit outdated. Still I managed to learn a few things from it though. I have done the obvious (Google search) and have found a few helpful articles, but nothing as in depth as I would like.\n\nI'm going to continue to search, but could you recommend some places that teach in depth the things I am needing to learn.

I find CI services like Circle to be incredibly slow even for building apk/unit testing, and you can only run instrumentation tests on virtual devices there. \n\nIn order to run on your own devices, what CI/setup do you use to run the tests? Jenkins seems like an obvious solution - you can have a runner with connected devices, but Jenkins is a bitch to set up and maintain (at least before Pipelines, maybe something has changed drastically?). I suppose one can also use TeamCity/GitLab, as both allow using own runners.\n\nThen there's execution - do you just run `./gradlew connectedDebugAndroidTest`, or do you use some tool like Spoon or Fork? Spoon seems pretty, but it doesn't work with Android Studio 3.0, and it seems the development is very slow at best (even Jake Wharton commented somewhere on an issue, that Square doesn't use Spoon internally anymore). So I wonder what is it that you use to run tests on devices, if anything? Something that helps with occasional broken pipes, collecting screenshots possibly, sharding, running only on selected devices etc...",

In this case I would like the last element to be a \"load more\" button instead of a loading icon.\n\nI figured out how to calculate if all elements are displayed at once, by calculating if layout managers item count equals RecyclerView's item count when layout is completed. Problem is that right now I am hooking into layout managers onLayoutComplete, but even here it causes an IllegalStateException if I try to call notify in the adapter.\n\nDoing the notify asynchronously after a small delay is not ideal either, since it can call notify during the layout of another list update, like the initial loading or refresh etc. Locking in the adapter does not work either, since layout manager updates asynchronously when notified.\n\nTL;DR\nI guess my question is two fold:\n\n * How to handle infinite scroll views with to few elements to scroll? Is there a hook I am not aware of?\n * How to make adapters notify-calls thread safe, and avoid \"IllegalStateException: Cannot call this method while RecyclerView is computing a layout or scrolling\"?\n * Or potential third option: Is this a road best not travelled?",

            "selftext": "Hi all, first off I hope it's OK to ask questions about using Xamarin in here?\n\nMy apologies if not, but assuming it is my problem is that I'm writing a very small app to play mp3's from a folder on my phone via a cable from the headphone jack into an old 8 bit computer that loaded games from tape, the ZX Spectrum +2.  Utilising this cable and enough volume I can load games some 10x quicker then off of tape.\n\nNow the volume from my phone is not loud enough to load the mp3 reliably but I happened to find a [\"Speaker Booster\"] (https://github.com/arpruss/speakerboost) app which, when I set the boost level to 60, works fantastic, it boosts the volume and the games load perfectly.\n\nI didn't want a system wide boost so I thought I could maybe write a very small app to play an mp3 from a folder on the SD Card and boost the volume at the same time, so I set about reading up on the subject and ended up with [this](https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/1HnYjt3p/).\n\nNow, whilst this is probably completely wrong it does seem to boost the volume nicely when the cable isn't plugged in and the phone is using the speaker but as soon as I try it with the Spectrum cable into the headphone jack on the phone the sound gets very, very quiet, almost inaudible, instead of boosting it.\n\nSetting the AudioSession to 0 in LoudnessEnhancer, which I believe makes it system wide, means I do get sound from the headphone jack again but it's not boosted.  I copied the SetTargetGain value from the Speaker Booster app that I know works, so I think that's OK.\n\nCould anyone give me any pointers please?\n\nThank you.",

As someone trying to follow the guidelines to the books, it's mostly just brought headaches.

Activity Transitions were my first experience with Transitions, and while I can't say I really knew what I was doing, in the end everything seemed to work after following the tutorials to the letter, and I got some nice looking and pretty smooth shared element transitions.\n\nIt all went downhill from there.\n\nI soon realized that I wasn't going to be able to accomplish what I needed to with Activities alone. I poked around a bit, and decided on Conductor. After all, it was the new, hip thing to try, right? \n\nBig mistake. \n\nShared element transitions in Conductor were an absolute *nightmare*, exacerbated greatly because I could never figure out why anything was going wrong (this will be a common theme going forward). I looked up some tutorials, ported my transitions over, and... nothing. It just blinked and flashed several times before abruptly popping to the next screen. So, debug it, right? I looked up my issues and found that it seemed to be a relatively common problem, and there were a few issues on GitHub, with what seemed to be potential solutions. After perusing these solutions for hours, I finally came up with something that sort-of resembled a transition. The problems? First, the entire screen flashed to black before transitioning, entirely ruining the intended effect. Second, the transition was just wrong. The image always immediately teleported to the top-left corner of the screen when beginning the transition. After trying for several more hours in vain (somehow, all the samples worked, despite doing almost the exact same things), I gave up.\n\nWell, it's just an issue with a third-party library, right? So next, I decided to switch to Fragments. The first decision I made was whether to use real Fragments or support library fragments. Despite only having to support 5.0+, to ensure consistency, I decided on support library fragments.\n\nAgain, big mistake.\n\nThis experience was barely better than Conductor. Although being a little easier to setup, ultimately the issues I had were very similar to those of Conductor. At least this time, the image only teleported about 30 pixels above the intended location rather than the top-left corner. I tried in vain to get this to work, all the while getting more and more confused by the Transitions API, which helpfully provides *no logging whatsoever*. But, at long last, I again was forced to admit defeat.\n\nSo, third time's a charm, right? I gave up on the support library and decided I would use the actual inbuilt platform Fragments. And... it worked! To some extent, at least. It wasn't particularly easy, but after debugging several issues, I finally got to a point where the transitions sort-of worked. But not on Lollipop, for some reason, and each transition only worked perfectly once (subsequent times would cause the image to randomly shrink to one-fourth its size). I figured I could solve these later though, and so I happily went on my way, finally able to work on the other parts of the app that had been much neglected through my Transition adventure.\n\nAnd things were good. Until Oreo.\n\nI didn't get Oreo until about a week ago to test, but let me tell you that it disappointed in a big way. For some unknown reason, Shared Elements have completely stopped working. And I can't get them to work. Despite being armed with all of this past experience, I simply can't get those stupid transitions to function. And there's no error messages or helpful logging of any kind, because there never is. It just blinks from one screen to another like nothing's wrong in the world. This time, it's even broken the *samples*. I downloaded a simple sample, and while the entrance transition did work, the return transition? Gone. No reason why, no explanation, no way to figure out what's going wrong, and that's in a project with 3 classes. \n\nThis time, I'm done with the Transitions API. I've given up letting this ridiculous monster of an API control me. I'm switching to using custom Animations. It's going to be a lot of work, but at this point I don't really care. Anything's better than the Transitions API, and with Animations, at least when something goes wrong I can figure out what it is.\n\n/Rant",
