    "description": "**Cryptography** is the art of creating mathematical / information theoretic assurances for who can do what with data, including but not limited to the classical example of encrypting messages so that only the key-holder can read it. Cryptography lives at an intersection of [math](/r/math), [programming](/r/programming), and [computer science](/r/compsci).\n\nThis subreddit is intended for links and discussions surrounding the theory and practice of modern and *strong* cryptography. **Please note that this is a technical subreddit, not a political one!** The focus is on the algorithms and the security of the implementations. \n\n---\n\n[Monthly cryptography wishlist threads!](https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/search?q=wishlist+thread&restrict_sr=on&sort=new) \n\n---\n\n**Rules** (along with normal [reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette))\n\nDon't forget to read our [**RULES PAGE**](/r/crypto/about/rules/)! The rules listed there are also used as this sub's report reasons. The quick version;\n\n* Assume good faith and be kind. This is a friendly subreddit. \n* Codes, simple ciphers, ARGs, and other such \"weak crypto\" don't belong here. (Rule of thumb: If a desktop computer can break a code in less than an hour, it's not strong crypto.) You're probably looking for /r/codes.\n* Do not ask people to break your cryptosystem without first sharing the algorithm. [Sharing just the output is like...](/r/crypto/comments/1boxkg/-/c98x4ej)\n* \"Crack this cipher\" challenges also belong in /r/codes *unless* they're based on interesting crypto implementation bugs, e.g. weak RSA keys.\n* Familiarize yourself with the following before posting a question about a novel cryptosystem, or else the risk is nobody will take their time to answer: \n  * [Kerckhoffs's principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerckhoffs%27s_principle)\n  * [Schneier's Law](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2011/04/schneiers_law.html)\n* Don't use this sub to cheat on competitions or challenges! You're expected to solve such problems yourself. You may ask for help to understand it, but you should disclose the source. \n* Systems that *use* crypto are not necessarily relevant here, e.g. Bitcoin. Maybe try /r/cryptocurrency? Political news also very rarely belong here. See the list of related subs below for alternatives. Remember that this sub is focused on the algorithms, and isn't political. \n\n---\n\n**Resources:**\n\n* [Our wiki pages](/r/crypto/wiki)  \n* Threads on starting in crypto [one](/r/crypto/hnze6) & [two](/r/crypto/3izwdo)\n* Thread of [crypto links](/r/crypto/2jw4yo) - [older thread](/r/crypto/ih1z3)\n* [Cryptology ePrint archive](http://eprint.iacr.org/) \n\n**Other subreddits that may be of interest:**\n\nTheory:\n\n* /r/algorithms\n* /r/mathematics, /r/math\n\nPractical:\n\n* /r/netsec - Network Security\n* /r/compsec - Local computer security\n* /r/websec - Security in the browser\n* /r/security - General security subreddit \n* /r/privacy - General privacy subreddit \n* /r/compsci & /r/ComputerScience - Development and application of algorithms \n\nEducational, hobbyist:\n\n* /r/gpgpractice - Do your testing here \n* /r/stanfordcrypto\n* /r/codes - General code cracking\n\nPolitical and in the news:\n\n* /r/privacypatriots/\n* /r/NSAleaks - Snowden documents and more \n* /r/restorethefourth\n\nSoftware:\n\n* /r/gpg (fairly empty)\n* /r/bitcoin, /r/cryptocurrency - crypto applied to money\n\nRelated:\n\n* /r/cryptography \n* /r/encryption \n* /r/weboftrust (fairly empty)\n* /r/capabilities - A type of security model\n* /r/Intelligence - Espionage\n\nMemes and low effort submissions:\n\n* /r/shittycrypto\n\n---\n\nFeel free to message the moderators with suggestions for how to improve this subreddit, as well as for requesting adding links in the sidebar.

            "selftext": "I have been passively reading this crypto subreddit for quite a while.\n\nTime for my first interaction. Hope you can provide your insights on this:\n\nGiven these requirements/wishes:\n\n* R1. Symmetric encryption of files to be uploaded to untrusted cloud storage\n* R2. Encrypted files should look like random data, so no magic headers\n* R3. Decrypting with any password should reveal no clue of success or failure\n* R4. Preferably no recognizable data on the inside as well\n\nIt seems that cascading two stream ciphers could fit the bill.\n\n\nThis naive example seems to support my idea of revealing nothing:\n\n    $ echo OK | openssl aes-256-ctr -iv 1 -K 1 | xxd -p\n    4de28a\n    $ echo 4de28a | xxd -p -r | openssl aes-256-ctr -iv 1 -K 1\n    OK\n    $ echo 4de28a | xxd -p -r | openssl aes-256-ctr -iv 1 -K 2\n    <q\n\nBoth commands exit with a successful return code.\n\n\nWould there be any objections to using this layered approach:\n\n* A1. Create two random nonces\n* A2. Encrypt in ofb mode, pass the stream to a second encryption in ctr mode.\n* A3. Use two different cipher algorithms in order to prevent possible interference\n* A4. Preserve the two nonces in the file name of the encrypted blob\n\n\nSomething along the line of:\n\n    # AES-256-CTR(IV1, KEY1, CAMELLIA-256-OFB(IV2, KEY2, PLAINTEXT)) \n    tar cfz - \"$1\" | openssl aes-256-ctr -iv \"$IV1\" -K \"$KEY1\" | openssl camellia-256-ofb -iv \"$IV2\" -K \"$KEY2\" > $IV1_$IV2.dat\n\n\nDrawbacks that I can think of:\n\n* D1. The exact file size is revealed - This could be somewhat mitigated by compressing first\n* D2. Malleable / unauthenticated - However, having no checksums is more or less a design feature\n* D3. Renaming the encrypted file means losing the essential IV values - This is a big risk\n\n\nWhat I am unsure about:\n\nThe adversary could have full knowledge of the implementation and have access to many encrypted files.\n\nAssuming all plaintext would start with some fixed characters, e.g. a tar or gzip header:\n\n* Q1: Would the two levels of random IVs provide an exponential search space?\n* Q2: Does using two different ciphers make this less susceptible to double xor effects?\n* Q3: Any other things to consider? How secure is this *reallly*?\n\nPlease fire away.\n",
