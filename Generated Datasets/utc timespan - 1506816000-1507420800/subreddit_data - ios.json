            "selftext": "So things were great (pre-Irma) since 2013.  I had my iPhone 6, 128gb living in its LifeProof case.  Then the week before Irma came, my phone started getting those emergency broadcast alerts (similar to what happens when you get an \"Amber Alert\".  Only this time, it was to warn me of the impending Irma (I live in SWFL).  I have an out of state area code so I'm guessing this is where my problem started.\n\nWhen my peers received these alerts (they came through a few times a day leading up, and then seemingly every couple hours 3X days prior, all the way to the day of), my phone would receive 3-5X as many (back to back to back to back, etc...).  Well 2-3 days pre-Irma, I went to acknowledge the alert so I could regain control of my digital duties and to my astonishment = my iPhone simply lost its connection to the cell towers.  Everyone around me w/ the same carrier was still in play so I thought to myself: 'Perhaps the alarms fried the sim card?  It is, after all, going on 4 years of age & I'm a HEAVY user.  \n\nSo I start hunting out open locations for my carrier. \nThey're all boarded up at this point.\nI find a Best Buy that's still open (on a skeleton crew) a city over.\n\nWe diagnose the issue w/ a new sim card.\nNo avail.\n\nI did what anyone in my position would do.  I bought the cheapest iPhone they had (iPhone 7, 128GB).  This really sucked because I was waiting all those years for the next \"revolutionary iPhone\".  \n\nThe story gets worse on that note but I'll get back on task.\n\nIrma comes.  Irma decimates.  Irma leaves.  I return the iPhone 7 @ Best Buy on the 14th day (15 day return policy) and buy another iPhone 7 (+) this time.  Apple releases their new lineups.  I, again, return the iPhone 7+ and exchange for the iPhone 8.  I'm so fed-up w/ swapping and restoring phones at this point - I say to myself...\n\nYou have an otherwise functional iPhone 6 w/ your entire life on it. Why not keep that nearby for data references and allow this new iPhone 8 to start its life with a fresh, clean slate (\"New Phone\" mode = no risk of bogging down everything with years of downloads & updates).\n\nFF through all the issues later identified on the first iOS 11, to now.\n\nI've updated this brand new iPhone 8 256GB w/ the iOS 11.0.2 and go figure, just encountered another call where there's high levels of STATIC!\n\nSo, for me at least, the latest update(s) have NOT fixed this issue! \nFurthermore, it's operating at speeds sub-par from what my iPhone 6 used to operate at for tasks such as:\nBrowsing Safari,\nFacebook Messenger,\nFacebook,\n+ various other apps...\n\nI've done the basic troubleshooting.  Rebooting, making sure apps are all up to date as well.\n\nEven on a 100MB/s wifi connection, safari locks up consistently.  \n\nI'm still trying to put my life back together from hurricane Irma.  I've spent an immense amount of time on having a functional phone since before Irma and am really resenting the fact I wasn't able to wait just a little longer to be able to get the iPhone X but am now wondering if I should consider switching to Android.  I actually wrote up an awesome article on why Apple is superior to Androids a few weeks back and am starting to question my sentiment from then...\n\nAny help, input would be greatly appreciated.  \n\nTIA \n\nKripDoughKnight",

However, every time I go on itunes and press update, when the update gets to the backing up part, it will always say, \"Cannot complete the update because the iPhone was disconnected\". I tried using different working wires but I keep getting the same message when I try to update on itunes. I tried restarting my iPhone and mac, but still nothing. I can't make any backups on itunes either because I keep getting this error.\n\nI can't restore my iphone because it says I have to have find my iphone disabled on icloud, but I forgot my apple account password for my icloud account, and when I tried to change it on iforgot, it said I have to wait 24 hours, then after 24 hours happened, it said I have to wait 15 days!

What I mean is that they were just old enough to not get the ability to update past iOS 9.3.0.\n\nSo YouTube still updates, no big. Yet for some time now. The full-size iPad couldn\u2019t play YouTube videos at 1080p60fps OR 720p60fps. The other iPad (a mini) was able to only play 720p60fps, but would get a playback error if 1080p60fps was tried, up until about 3 days ago. \n\n3 says ago the options for 60fps vanished altogether . Anyone know the \u201cinside baseball\u201d stuff that\u2019s going on here?  \n\nMany argue that the older iPads and heir processors are too week to playback at 60fps, but that\u2019s obviously not true. \n\nSolution/Work-around?

I am a PC user (yeah, I know) and I checked my iCloud photos backup on my server today and I can't read any of the .HEIC files that iCloud is saving. Apple basically told me I have two choices.\n\n1. Use third party software to convert all of the HEIC files to JPG on my computer.\n\n2. Choose \"Most Compatible\" on my Photos settings to save the images in JPG. The issue with this is that if I choose \"Most Compatible\", I will not be able to record video in 4K 60FPS, which is the reason I bought this iPhone 8+ (and portrait mode).  So, if I want to take a photo, I have to go into the settings and choose \"most compatible\", and if I decide I want to shoot a video, I have to go into my settings and choose \"high efficiency\". Kind of ridiculous. I guess I wouldn't have that big of a problem with it if i could change these settings from within the camera app.\n\nBut what Apple is telling me is basically it's a Windows issue, not their issue, because Windows doesn't support their new format.\n\nSo basically, I'm a PC user, [fuck me right](https://i.imgur.com/bvdck0w.gifv)?\n\n",

It seems to be the highest one for me, yet it seems to stay the same for several days then just jump up by a MB, usually when I haven't actually been using my phone.

There are many bugs in iOS 11 (even iOS 11.0.2) on my iPhone 7 Plus for instance there are random total freeze ups that can only be fixed by force restarting the phone and for some reason I am completely unable to send videos (even when the formats are changed to the most compatible options)  to android users. So I downgraded to iOS 10.3.3 (while they were still signing it) \nHowever when trying to pair my watch on WatchOS4 with my phone on iOS 10.3.3, I get the error message that my phone software is out of date. \n\nIt was my understanding that you could request a downgrade through the Genius Bar, they'd send your watch off, have it downgraded, and send it back. However after a lengthy chat with \"experts\" in the Apple support app, they told me this is not at all possible. \n\nTL;DR is it possible to request a downgrade from WatchOS4 to WatchOS3",

I've done a couple of testing (Streaming App and in Safari, at least 1080p resolution, etc.) and it seems to be broken only at App Store. So I guess Home Wi-Fi is okay it must be my modem settings? I also tried to download apps using mobile Data and it's marginally faster than my Home Wi-Fi so that makes me think it could be really some sort of modem/isp issue or apple server, etc.\nI have an iPhone 7 plus running iOS 11.0.2. tried tinkering DNS, reset settings and forget the Wi-Fi but still no good. Not sure if it's iOS causing this but I remember it wasn't like this before I jump to iOS 11",

However, over the past maybe month or so, I have been unable to. It gives me the \"you cannot change quality over data\" message. When I search about it on google, I just get the answer that \"you cannot change quality over data.\" But I literally have been for that last 4 months that I got an unlimited data plan. Only recently did it not let me. Did they just make it not possible, did I miss something?  Any explanation would be appreciated. Thank you.",

I can only assume someone out there thinks that's in any way a good idea, but I'm not one of them. \n\nI'm currently backing up my itunes library onto an external harddrive and will be reverting back to 12.4 with an online guide. Then I'm going to back up my phone on that. \n\nAfter I do *that*, would it be possible to just upgrade my phone directly to 10.3.3? \n\nIt seems that there's a way to do so that involves upgrading to 11 then downgrading with a factory reset, but that's just as unfeasible as having to download and manage all my apps via my phone. Worst case scenario is I lose all my data / app data and wondering if it can be done without doing that.\n\nIn case anyone's first reaction is \"Why on earth were you still on 8.4?\", the answer would be battery life. My 6+ with the iOS it came on can last for over 72 hours if need be, while every new iOS comes with a laundry list of battery drain horror stories. \n\nThank you for any help you can give!",

When I tried to start it afterwards, it would just keep crashing. When I connected my phone to iTunes, it said that I'm using 24GB more storage than I have. So it seems like the filesystem got corrupted. \nI reset the phone and recovered from backup.\n\n2. Everything worked fine for few days, but now when I tap on \"Songs\" in my Apple Music app, it crashes. I can still get to all my songs via \"Playlists\" and all of them seems to be playing correctly, but I cannot get to \"Songs\" section anymore.\n\nAnybody else noticed similar issues?\n\nI'm upgrading now to 11.0.2. I will report back here if this fixes my issues (although I'm not holding my breath since they didn't mention anything about Music app in the changelog).\n",

If I delete the beta profile now, would Software Update think that iOS 11.0.1 is the latest version and let me get on it, or would it say that I'm already running the latest version? And if iOS 11.0.2 is released, could I use the software update to move from 11.1 beta 1 to iOs 11.0.2? And I can't downgrade to 11.0.0/11.0.1 because of backup compatibly :(\n\nEDIT: Don't get why the downvotes tho.",

You can't just make the device run at full steam all the time and expect a decent battery life.\n\nHere's the battery usage screen (language in Finnish) https://i.imgur.com/8eNC6dp.png",

Ive just downgraded and it's a remarkable difference. I almost spend double the time on apps on ios 10 compared to ios 11. \n4. 3d touch wtf its been like that since July fix it already\n5. Instagram loads a lot when you first open it up and sometimes (or often) stutters when scrolling fast\n6.

            "selftext": "Hello, comrades.\n\nAfter updating to iOS 11, I find that my Bluetooth keyboard (an Anker A7726, which I'm pretty happy with) doesn't work anymore. I.e., it's paired, it's got a fresh battery, it just doesn't type words onto any text-y app (Scrivener, Notes, spotlight search, Chrome, Safari...). *EDIT: iPad 12.9\", if it matters.*\n\nI've done the usual things - turn things off and back on again, turn off Bluetooth and turn it back on, unpair the device and re-pair it ... What's kind of hilarious is that when I go through the unpair/re-pair rain dance, the iPad prompts me to enter a 4 digit code on the keyboard, which I do - *and that works!* - but it doesn't type anything else after that.\n\nHas anyone else seen similar? How do I remediate this?",

I've been able to download three more apps since this issue arising, but 99% of the time I'm not able to download any apps.\n\nI've tried to restart my phone, I've changed my settings so that apps will download over cellular, I've signed in and out of my Apple ID, I don't have any restrictions turned on.
