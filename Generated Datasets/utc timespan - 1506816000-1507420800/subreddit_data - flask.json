As an example they are State/County/City, and I have the models already built with the proper many-to-one relationships. There are many Counties in a State and many Cities in a County. \n\nRight now all the select elements are independent of each other but what I want is to have the ability to filter the more specific input elements based on the more general ones. For example if you select a state, the county element only shows counties in that state, and the city element only shows cities in those counties. \n\nProblem is, I don't really know where to start. I have concluded that I *probably* need to use jquery to dynamically alter the select element options. Not sure, I don't know jquery and will have to learn it from scratch.  \n\nAre there any examples of this sort of thing? Is there another way of doing it? Any modules that can make my life easier? I am going to chase the jquery rabbit hole for now but if anyone can steer me in the right direction I would be thankful. ",

I'm making good progress on things, but I've come across a spot that has me stumped - having to do with forms and the best way to make it do what I want it to do.  Basically, I have a repeating table structure that looks like this:\n\n    <Date>\n    <Location Name> | <StartTime1> | ... | <StartTimeN\n\nI did this by hand coding a table in HTML (couldn't figure out the Flask/Pythonic way of doing it), but now I'm running into a problem when I try to add the functionality to select one of them and reserve it.  I know how I can add the select radio button with each StartTime, but it seems like that is missing a bunch of the security aspects of flask's hidden field/CSRF protections.  In addition, the performance of the existing logic is sufficient for my scale, but it's really a horrible big O() with multiple nested loops.  That bugs me.  \n\nSo - how do I make this code better?\nRoute:\n\n    @app.route('/cookie_reserve_booth/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])\n    def cookie_reserve_booth():\n        booths = (CookieBooth.query.filter(CookieBooth.starttime >= datetime.now())\n                                   .filter(CookieBooth.endtime <= datetime.now() + timedelta(days=10))\n                                   .order_by(CookieBooth.starttime))\n        dates = set()\n        locations = set()\n        for i in booths:\n            dates.add(i.starttime.date())\n        for i in booths:\n            locations.add(i.location.name)\n        dates = sorted(list(dates))\n        locations = sorted(list(locations))\n        return render_template('cookie_reserve_booth.html', booths=booths,\n                                dates=dates, locations=locations)\n\nTemplate:\n\n    {% extends \"cookie_base.html\" %}\n    {% block cookie_content %}\n\n    <div class=\"container\" align=\"left\">\n        <br />\n        <h4>View upcoming booths</h4>\n        <br />\n        <form method=\"POST\" action=\"{{ url_for('cookie_reserve_booth') }}\" name=\"BoothSelectForm\">\n            <table border=\"1\">\n                {% for date in dates %}\n                <tr><td>{{ date.strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d\") }}<td></tr>\n                <tr><td>\n                <table border=\"2\">\n                    {% for location in locations %}\n                    <tr>\n                        <td>{{ location }}</td>\n                        {% for booth in booths %}\n                            {% if booth.starttime.date() == date and booth.location.name == location %}\n                                <td><label><input type=\"radio\" id=\"booth_id\" name=\"selected_booth\"> {{ booth.starttime.time() }} </label></td>\n                            {% endif %}\n                        {% endfor %}\n                    </tr>\n                    {% endfor %}\n                </table>\n                </td></tr>\n                {% endfor %}\n            </table>\n            <button type=\"submit\">Reserve</button>\n        </form>\n    </div>\n\n    {% endblock %}\n\nI don't have a separate form yet - but I think I need one.\n",

As an example they are State/County/City, and I have the models already built with the proper many-to-one relationships. There are many Counties in a State and many Cities in a County. \n\nRight now all the select elements are independent of each other but what I want is to have the ability to filter the more specific input elements based on the more general ones. For example if you select a state, the county element only shows counties in that state, and the city element only shows cities in those counties. \n\nProblem is, I don't really know where to start. I have concluded that I *probably* need to use jquery to dynamically alter the select element options. Not sure, I don't know jquery and will have to learn it from scratch.  \n\nAre there any examples of this sort of thing? Is there another way of doing it? Any modules that can make my life easier? I am going to chase the jquery rabbit hole for now but if anyone can steer me in the right direction I would be thankful. ",

I'm looking for something to do client-client with. I've read about using rooms with socket.io and it seems VERY difficult at my skill level to get this working properly as I need special keys with rooms for specific members to other members. And also knowing how to reflect that to chat over the server. Would also love to find out a way to save a chat history too.\n\nI'm currently making a small project so it's all done locally and will possibly host it online for testing purposes only. I'm open to suggestions about any APIs or something I can integrate with Flask that supports private messaging if that makes it easier as right now it's a concept thing so would not mind if the API did all the work of chatting privately and saving the chat history.\n\nThank you!\n\n",
