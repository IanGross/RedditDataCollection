    "description": "[**New to reddit? Click here!**](/wiki/reddit_101)  \n  \n**What to post:**\n\n* Single purpose websites.\n\n* Top-level domains.\n\n* Web Tools.\n\n* Minimal or beautifully designed websites.\n\n*  Awesome websites that offer a unique service.\n\n\n_____\n\n**What NOT to post (detailed explanations can be found [here](/r/InternetIsBeautiful/w/rules)):**\n\n\n*Sites that are not unique.*\n\n\n* Aggregators/ collections. \n\n* Something everyone on the internet already knows about (e.g., Netflix, Khan Academy, etc.)  \n\n* Something not unique (includes **generators**, blogs, tumblrs, etc.)\n\n\n\n* Web games. Post to /r/webgames instead.  \n\n* Articles or videos.\n\n* Static images, gifs, animations that serve the same purpose of gifs or collections of either.  \n\n* Sites that serve a political agenda or otherwise induce drama \n\n* Online stores, paid services, or sites which serve only to sell a specific product. Try /r/shutupandtakemymoney instead.  \n  \n\n*Sites that pose a potential security risk.*\n\n\n* Websites that require a login or email address. Includes Facebook, Google+, or otherwise.  \n\n* Websites that require a webcam.\n  \n* Extensions, software, or other content which requires a download to use.\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n______\n\n**Comments**\n\n* We enforce a standard of common decency and civility here. Personal attacks, bigotry, fighting words and otherwise shitty behavior will be removed and may result in a ban.\n\n______  \n  \n**Moderator Discretion**  \n  \n* Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but we have beheld a lot! This subreddit is highly curated and the moderators frequently must use their discretion and judgement as a team when enforcing our rules.   \n  \n______  \n  \nClick [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/InternetIsBeautiful/about/traffic/) for our traffic stats.\n\n___\n\nSomething different? Try **/r/InternetIsUgly**. If you exhibit a similar addictive lust for information as you do for internet, we highly recommend you go give **/r/dataisbeautiful** a sub too.  \n\nIf this subreddit for whatever reason fails to provide the interactivity you need, we also highly recommend a look at **/r/interactivewebsites** for a less diluted dosage of interactivity. \n\nWas your post removed from here? Found a cool site that's not particularly unique or beautiful? Head on over to **/r/InternetIsInteresting**.  \n\nMake it mobile:   **/r/AndroidIsBeautiful/**\n\nWaste even more time: **/r/InternetIsUseless**\n____  \n  \n######[**/r/AndroidIsBeautiful**](http://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidIsBeautiful)",
