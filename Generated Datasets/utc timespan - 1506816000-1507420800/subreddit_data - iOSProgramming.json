Please browse it first before asking questions that are answered there.\n\nIf you are looking to get started (iOS programming in general or some specific area), here are more relevant links for you:\n\n- [Swift or Objective-C?](https://redd.it/4vnm0e) if you don't know which language to choose. (New posts asking this will be removed)\n\n## Related Subreddits\n\n- /r/macosprogramming\n- /r/swift \n- /r/ObjectiveC \n- /r/ios \n- /r/iPhone\n- /r/tvOS\n- /r/watchOS\n- /r/ARKitCreators\n\n## Related Links\n\n- [The Swift Programming Language](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/) also [available as an iBook](https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/the-swift-programming-language/id881256329?mt=11&ls=1) - new Apple's programming language for writing iOS and OS X applications;\n- [Objective-C primer](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ProgrammingWithObjectiveC/Introduction/Introduction.html) if you are new to the language and CocoaTouch frameworks.\n- [URL Loading System](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/URLLoadingSystem/URLLoadingSystem.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/10000165i)\n- [CoreData programming guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CoreData/)\n- There is also dedicated subreddit for learning Objective-C: /r/learnobjectivec\n\nThere's too many to list them all, however here's a convenient link to [all programming guides](https://developer.apple.com/search/index.php?q=Programming%2BGuide&platform=OS%20X&platform=iOS&platform=General) at apple.com\n\nTake note that this list is live and based on most frequent questions in posts will be updated with \"quicklinks\".",

Or just that your monetized options can\u2019t be required to access portions of the Apple Music API. \n\nDoes anyone know of any other cases in the guidelines that are similar to this?\n\nThanks!",

I've done a few little demo apps but now I'm trying my hand at my first game and I'd like to do it as properly as I can so that I learn the right way. The issue I'm having at the moment, that I've spent the last 5 hours trying to fix, is this: \n\nI'm starting with a simple space shooter since that seems to be the thing to start with. In my variant my ship is static at the bottom center (sort of a Missile Command clone).  \n\nI generate and place all of my sprites in code. Something like this: \n\n    import SpriteKit\n    import GameplayKit\n    \n    class GameScene: SKScene, SKPhysicsContactDelegate {\n    \n        override func didMove(to view: SKView) {\n            physicsWorld.contactDelegate = self\n            let shipTexture = SKTexture(imageNamed: \"rocketship\")\n            let spaceship = SKSpriteNode(texture: shipTexture)\n            spaceship.physicsBody = SKPhysicsBody(rectangleOf: spaceship.size)\n            spaceship.physicsBody?.collisionBitMask = 0\n            spaceship.physicsBody?.affectedByGravity = false\n            spaceship.position = CGPoint(x: 0, y: -(self.frame.size.height / 2) + (spaceship.size.height / 2))\n            addChild(spaceship)\n            print(\"Loaded spaceship\")\n        }\n    }        \n\n\nThis works great on a portrait oriented iPhone but gets all sorts of random in landscape or on iPads. In my debugging I've determined that self.frame.size never changes regardless of the device size. I take that to mean that I'm trying to get the screen size but in reality I'm getting a scene size or a view size or something of that nature.   \n\nCan anyone point me at a tutorial or walkthrough that covers this? \n\nThanks!

Does the protected format of Apple Music songs prevent apps from using them? \n\nHere\u2019s the app: Beat Hazard Ultra by Cold Beam Games Ltd\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/beat-hazard-ultra/id475336263?mt=8",

My second app has over 130,000 impressions, but less than 100 app units. These numbers don't make any sense to me. How could my first app have more downloads than impressions? (Especially by a factor of 10). Secondly, how does my second app have 1,300 times more impressions but only have less than 100 downloads? Another weird thing is that both my apps seemed to get the most impressions and downloads on the same day even thought they were released weeks apart, and most of the impressions and downloads are coming from China (some Russia).

ARC = automatic reference counting \n2. If two objects have a strong reference to each other, they'll never get deallocated, and so you'll end up with a memory leak\n3. ARC keeps tracking on all objects, and when they're initialized they're count goes to one, and every-time something references them it increases.  When the count goes to zero, they get deallocated.\n\nIf I were going to an interview, where the hiring manager knew I knew this much of memory management, and was going to ask me other questions about it, what all would he ask?

Based on time-of-flight, angle-of-incidence, and other techniques, it is possible to determine depth information even under adverse lighting conditions.\n\n**Algorithms** - Recently there have been several advances in Neural Networks, and we need to thank both Google and Facebook for that. \n\n**Hardware** - it all started with NVIDIA, that transformed its GPU products (traditionally used to power graphics for video games) into computing engines for DNNs.\n\nWhat do you guys think about it?\n\nMy team and I [discuss Face Recognition in more details here.](https://ymedialabs.com/a-deeper-dive-into-iphone-x-face-recognition/)\n",

Occasionally you might get \"rubberbanding\", where the real location takes over before the fake location provider overrides it with your fake location.  The typical advice is to wrap your phone in tinfoil to block the GPS sensors so this doesn't occur.\n\nIn other words, on Android, fake location apps can literally *set* and *replace* your entire location with one you choose.  You can be in a place with *no* GPS signal (e.g. if you open Maps or any other app, it will say \"can't detect location\") and then open your mock location app, set a location, and it works.  Maps now shows your fake location as well as anything else.\n\nNow, when it comes to iOS, everything I have observed tells me this is NOT the case.\n\nI was on a plane, using the wi-fi, and trying to fake a location.  Open Maps, it says location not found, because obviously I'm 10000 feet in the air, it's not going to find anything.  (Also, keep in mind this is an iPod Touch, so there's no actual GPS sensors, just Wi-Fi based location!)\n\nI'm jailbroken and have LocationHandle, one of few mock location apps to work on iOS 10.  If I try to use \"offset\" mode, it obviously fails because it tries to apply an offset to a nonexistent location.  Even \"normal\" mode, which has a very Engrishy-description, \"It will change your reality location to the Base Coordinate only\", fails.  It \"works\" in that it doesn't show me an error and appears to be working, but I open Maps and still get \"cannot detect location\"\n\nThe same thing applies to a certain popular tweak for a certain popular app which I will not name here.  If I get the \"cannot detect location\" message, trying to set a fake location doesn't actually do anything and I'm still shown the same message.\n\nSo from a programming standpoint, does iOS lack the ability to just *set* a location to the point where all apps see that as your one and only, true base location?  It would seem like the way it works internally is for your device to get a location, and then for any mock location providers to override that location with their own.  If you're unable to get a location from the time you boot the device, they all fail.  Am I missing something here?",

Just about every resource I find online, teaches you how to layout views, through the storyboard (bummer!).\n\nAre there any suggestions of frameworks for laying out views? What do you folks use?\n\nCan anyone please recommend some sources (books, links) to wrap my head around it? I've done C++ on the server for about 10 years, so assume I have no layout experience, but I'd love to learn. I in particular, struggle with the basic math in determining where a particular view should be placed, it never does what I want it to do.\n\nLooking forward for some help.",

            "selftext": "Hello r/iOSProgramming\n\n**A bit of background:** \n\nI've been developing mobile (mainly iOS) apps since 2011. After high school, I didn't pursue any high education and have been basically consulting/working remotely. \n\nAround early 2014, I submitted my resume to a recruiter (was low on clients/work) and forgot about it as they never got back to me. Last week I get an email from them asking for a phone interview. I wasn't expecting anything and I didn't even read the job description thoroughly except for the main title 'iOS Developer' and i just replied back with a time for phone interview along with my resume(which is just full of clients/apps I've worked for, no education section at all) just to test the waters. \n\nI passed the ph. interview and now they are looking for an in-person interview. They are offering me 90k + bonus. It's one of the big companies in Canada (it's a household name here but don't really want to name them). \n\n**The problem**\nSo after the interview, I read the job description (yes i know...) and everything is fine, I'm experienced with/comply with every requirement except for one: a degree in comp sci/soft. eng. or similar field. \n\nNow I've never had a proper 9-5 and I'm not worried about the interview except for one thing: What if during the interview they ask about my education? I'm not sure how to answer that.\n\nI've developed 40+ apps in last 6-7 years. I'm not saying I'm very experienced of course not, but I do feel like i'm much farther ahead in terms of experience than the average college kid who just graduated CS. But I've got this complex that I don't have a degree and it's going to kill me if they reject me just because of that.\n\n\n**Question**\nI guess my question is: Should I just let them know now? Or first thing during the interview and clear it out of the way? Or just hope they don't ask me? What if they get angry at me saying I wasted their time when the job spec clearly stated I need a degree?\n\nIs / was anyone else in this situation? Please share!",

Anyways, I have been using an app called \"downloads\" for some years now on my iphone, and I paid for it too, but a couple of years ago the developer or Apple decided to pull it from the app store i guess and now there are no more updates. Lo and behold, I update to iOS 11 and it now crashes at launch. I have no experience with developing or code but I do have the ipa file on my mac and I guess it can be edited in Xcode? I have no idea. Is there anything I can do to maybe edit the code in the app to make it work again? I have no intent to distribute this, I just want it to work on my iPhone only and that's it.

I really want to dive into iOS developing and want to get to know the platform and I realized that I'm not going to learn/improve without getting a MacBook (shocker right?).

If I'm lucky enough to get a job/internship after the first 1-2 years, will this mac be enough to handle these bigger projects?\n\nAlso, I didn't want to sound cocky, I just know that a lot of firms in my country are hiring young iOS developers and that's why I think I will be able to get a job fast.\n\nTL;DR: I have a chance to buy a MBP2017 with the specs listed above for 1,400$, (which is about the max amount of money I can gather), will it serve me well for the 2 questions I asked above\n",

I'm not looking to make the jump yet until ABI stability, partly because it just seems like the toolchain will be more mature at that point. (Not to mention hopefully Xcode will have better support for Swift refactoring and so on in a year.) I understand that 2.3 -> 3 was the last breaking jump between versions, but still don't want to invest too much in 4 yet if 5 will ensure that the language and tools are fully-baked.\n\nAnyone else planning to switch to Swift, but just not yet? It seems like this sub is mostly people who have enthusiastically made the jump to Swift, people who learned iOS development in Swift to begin with, and a minority of Obj-C old hands (like me) who are skeptical of Swift. Though while some of the latter think that Swift was a mistake and mis-designed to begin with, I'm just waiting until it (and not even the language itself, but the toolchain) gets better enough to switch.",
