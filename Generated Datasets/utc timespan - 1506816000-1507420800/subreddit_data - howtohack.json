After my email was confirmed, I was given a code to provide the installation software.\n\n\nAssuming:\n\n1) The software does not have a bank of valid license codes because the code is generated by the server\n\n2) The software sends this code to the server for authentication, and then receives a 'yes, the code is valid\" from the server.\n\n\nThis got me thinking, would it be possible to intercept the information being sent to the program from the internet? This seems like it would be a huge vulnerability, as authentication could be duplicated assuming the \"password\" is static and the information could be passed to the program in the same way it receives it from the internet.\n\n\nTL;DR: Can information being sent to and from a specific program be intercepted, like is done with packet sniffing.",

One problem that I recently have inherited is a decrepit old windows 2003 server with a accounting software that used to be called Mas90 it is now managed by a company (Sage). The server finally had two drives fail in the raid array that had the software on it so we are trying to recover our data for archival purposes. I have a good backup of the data but need the admin password for the software to copy over the data correctly.\n\nI have exhausted a search for this mysterious admin password but all leads I could think of are dead. The last time this software was used by anyone in our company was around 2005. The IT team here now was not around when this was actively used and the last systems manager that we still have contact information for has no idea what it would be.\n\n~~So what I need is a password cracking tool that could be brute force (doesn't really matter about speed as i have until the end of October to get into the software) or table based cracks that can fill a field in the program in windows. (https://imgur.com/a/MrFT5)~~\n\nI'm looking for ANY advice or help in this matter. I've never really used any password cracking tools before so if I am approaching this in the wrong way let me know.\n\ntl;dr lost admin password to software need to use password cracking tools to crack password. Help needed!\n\n**Edit**: Sorry for the delay on updating kinda had a hurricane hit us so had other priorities for a while. Anyways, I got a working setup with MAS90 now. I was going about this wrong because I was so unfamiliar with the software since I had never used it, nobody really remained that had ever used it, and documentation online was poor. /u/williamogle posted this link: http://www.tek-tips.com/viewthread.cfm?qid=1626845 In which describes creating new companies with the same company code and copying over the according files. Not /u/williamogle fault that I didn't understand what the forum meant. It took me a while to understand not to copy over the entire MAS90 folder just the corresponding folders for the companies.\n\nThe Following is my update to the ticket in our help desk with some details redacted but complete guide here in case some poor sorry soul has to do what I did.\n\n tl;dr everything is functional again. Wall of text follows with details. Backup of virtual machine will be in the IT shared folder.\n\nLONG UPDATE:\n\nSo what I did to get MAS 90 working again was\n1. Created a virtual box with windows server 2003\n\n2. Activated Windows server 2003 (Product License Code: **[REDACTED]**)\n(Activation Method Telephone: you can call in and activate or use this code\n**[REDACTED]**)\n\n3. Installed Service packs 1 and 2 restarting after each\n\n4. Installed windows wic\n\n5. Installed .net Framework 4.0\n\n6. Installed MAS90 from S:\\IT Department\\MAS90 Backup\\Sage\\Version44\\_CDs\\MAS90 Version 440\nYou Launch the autorun.exe to install MAS90 from the menu. While installing you want to set standard security\nand create a password for the administrator (Currently it is: **[REDACTED]**)\n\n7. Installed Adobe Reader also found in the autorun.exe from the last step.\n\n8. Launch MAS90 and log in as Administrator (Password currently is: **[REDACTED]**)\n\n9. Create companies with company codes (create and manage your sage MAS90 companies on the launch box)\nexactly as it had before these can be found in: S:\\IT Department\\MAS90 Backup\\Sage\\Version44\\MAS90 in the form of MAS_XXX the XXX is the company code ex: BC5, PCD, MP2 etc. No other information is needed to be filled out here just the company code.\n\n10. Close out of Mas90 and open up the backup folder and copy theMAS90 folder **ONLY FOR THE COMPANY CODES** found here: S:\\IT Department\\MAS90 Backup\\Sage\\Version44\\mas 90\\MAS_XXX\n\n11. Paste folder at C:\\Program Files\\Sage Software\\MAS 90\\Version4\\mas 90\\MAS_XXX\n\n12. Click yes to all to replace files with same names.\n\n13. Launch MAS90\n\n14. Log in as Administrator\n\n15. Click Sage MAS90 Company Maintenance\n\n16. Now for **EVERY** company code click **Activate**, check all, proceed, once done return to previous window\nclick convert, check convert data for all companies, proceed.\n\n17. return to Administrative tools window click role maintenance\n\n18. Setup roles as needed. I created a test role witch has access to everything **(This is NOT SECURE)** but works..\n\n19. Return to Administrative Tools, User Maintenance\n\n20. Create users as needed but be sure to add company and role access (I also added start date but not sure if that is needed.) Company can be set to all, role access set to the role(s) created.\n\n21. navigate to the MAS90 folder found here C:\\Program Files\\Sage Software\\MAS 90\\Version4\nEdit security permissions to allow everyone full access to the folder.(Technically you only need to do this for the license folder but as this is no longer going to be used for anything other than archival purposes it isn't really important.)\n\nThis concludes the setup for MAS90 However if you want to setup the server further I suggest you follow steps\nopt 1-6\n\nOPT1. On host computer open virtual box manager settings for the created virtual box.\nOPT2. Go to network and in the attached to field select bridged adapter. Copy down the MAC address for later\nOPT3. Go to Display, Remote Display, check enable server, leave defaults (Don't know if server port is a default\n3389 if not set and authentication method external)\nOPT4. Add Server to domain so domain accounts can login.\nOPT5. On Virtual Server right click my computer, properties, remote, enable remote desktop on this computer,\nselect remote users and add all appropriate users.\nOPT6. Create a reservation in DHCP and DNS for the MAC address (that way the  virtual server address does not change)\n\nLast Edited:10 October 2017 @ 09:59 am by Mason\n09 October 2017 @ 16:43 pm by Mason ",

            "selftext": "Hey all,\n\nI have a couple of questions regarding memory allocation and assembly. Upon deciding to look into Buffer Overflows I kind of fell in love with the (almost romantic) relationship between the processor and memory, so I'm looking to understand all of this.\n\n**Some context**\n_Note: Lets assume this is for Intel architectures_\n\nOn every function call, there's a procedure prelude/prolog, where the processor allocates the necessary memory(buffer) for local variables within that same function. \n\nThe first thing to happen is the %EBP gets pushed to the top of the stack, saving the previous frame pointer, then the Stack Pointer(%ESP) gets copied over to %EBP's position(because %ESP needs to stay at the top of the stack), setting %EBP as a new Frame Pointer, and setting the instruction pointer at the function's return address. \n\n##So we have this\n\n    |     0\n    |     x\n    |     D\n    |     8\n    |     f\n    |     f\n    |     f\n    |     f\n    |     f\n    |     c\n    ^     ^\n    |     |\n    |     Return Address/%IP\n    |    \n     New Frame Pointer/%EBP/%ESP\n\nAfter this, the function gets called, begins running, and to the left of the frame pointer a buffer of allocated memory is set. Lets say its 8 bytes(2 words). %ESP subtracts by 8, allocating 8 bytes of memory to its stack(%ESP points to the new top of the stack).\n\n\n                |     0\n        8       |     x\n        b       |     D\n        y       |     8\n        t       |     f\n        e       |     f\n        s       |     f\n                |     f\n                |     f\n                |     c\n                ^     ^\n                |     |\n    ^           |     Return Address/%IP(InstructionPointer)\n    |           |    \n    %ESP       New Frame Pointer/%EBP\n\n\nAfter the memory is set, the variables also get copied from their high addresses in the DATA portion of memory, down to the Stack, to the right of the return address(figuratively).\n\n                |     0        0        0\n        8       |     x        x        x\n        b       |     D        f        f\n        y       |     8        f        f\n        t       |     f        f        f\n        e       |     f        f        f\n        s       |     f        f        f\n                |     f        f        f\n                |     f        f        f\n                |     c       a        8\n                ^     ^      |_________|\n                |     |          2 Words, 8 Bytes\n                |     |\n                |     |\n    ^           |     Return Address/%IP(InstructionPointer)\n    |           |    \n    %ESP        New Frame Pointer/%EBP\n\n##My question:\n1)How does the %ESP know the amount it needs to subtract before the variables are even pulled from DATA to the Stack, and if it can even do that, 2) why do the variables get copied to lower addresses afterwards anyway?\n\nThe only thing I can think of is\n\n1. Processor has access to all portions of memory(Text,DATA,unallocated,Stack)\n2. Faster access??\n\nAm I close?\nIf any of my notions are incorrect, please let me know - I've only recently delved deeper into memory segmentation and I'm looking to understand everything.\n\nThanks in advance!",

What I can't wrap my mind around is how these passphrases are pre-shared so that both the client and access point have them and can then generate the same pre-shared key. Surely not every passphrase is pre-shared on both devices via wired connection only so that it's not sent through the air? \n\nI do realize this may sound somewhat basic and I feel I'm on the verge of realizing how it works, but I can't quite get there yet.",
